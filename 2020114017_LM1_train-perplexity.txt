For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	10.133471468164066
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	8.818844938777556
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	5.143424650463734
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Bel√©m Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	7.988521825395614
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	7.093133076386562
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	4.778586336644412
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	7.6036373539398445
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	7.222404191232211
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	6.567112261110968
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	8.206100905736502
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	6.160311832025365
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	6.356415827138054
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	6.265581995158724
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	7.1201055469867205
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	8.506614816029096
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	7.521785591635632
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	7.338799486648181
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	7.393124099440119
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	6.78319574903012
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	6.990545113578002
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	8.28113765275979
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	6.478680720539623
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	6.377415151107496
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	9.765367789401083
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	7.5377376830994605
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	6.057280072464233
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	5.177555194149211
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	8.60730125336728
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	8.090567141310295
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	5.273845241223421
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	7.487189619388142
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	7.254532560940872
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	8.282066028351704
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	5.236413744888763
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	7.770298110140285
It is just a question of how.	7.740002449476932
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	9.74310987459899
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	5.376025583760542
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	8.060852034495463
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	8.289060864489956
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	7.180399898576615
We need to look very carefully at those.	11.55628014372158
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	8.286050056381168
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	6.495057625181219
A number of codes have since been introduced.	13.139838273447786
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	8.012485008757478
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	6.614162805313912
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	7.081422535980938
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	5.388372801503774
That is all to the good.	10.799540126036979
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	2.8992462764226388
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	7.919245330860565
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	11.749173933580876
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	6.778680782665164
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	8.110767837733034
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	9.399041132589028
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	6.9498733602739655
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	9.392939557082565
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	8.197231100823263
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	6.81559159610888
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	6.140407328628792
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	7.735523538360219
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	5.196754703550554
I think this proposal is a good one.	8.231887936291502
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	7.089621184194992
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	6.733489595432021
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	5.730271770456807
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	8.390584165867551
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	6.602355278385055
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	5.107669185081467
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	6.80189187151333
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	9.856308293014123
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	8.041423893120882
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	7.213795417959541
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	8.702758545348205
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	5.952221332659801
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	4.308209116069966
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	2.276486467611743
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	7.832411722708601
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	7.062776186367608
If not, why not?	2.384739774090182
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	7.147912675218264
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	6.618812215882593
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	4.15269830813519
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	8.661641424547325
We must put a stop to this trend.	4.091340416495393
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	8.392481849148217
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	7.51220803272386
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	8.16312422217011
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	5.454004100809893
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	6.311025781299375
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	8.179711091967597
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	8.630545440202686
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	7.2085388358154825
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	8.758855875067706
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	6.469007793392791
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	7.678303076854232
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	11.371461386109193
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	7.910417913751437
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	7.64914762568487
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	7.803325313685852
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	10.735730402290667
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	6.373369850537516
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	11.02970767306791
We are discussing coherence here.	14.597190206311929
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	6.661753783712429
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	6.755325262640844
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	11.860465488014654
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	8.1861054369186
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	7.608384697666223
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	5.806674690997676
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	9.683615547513437
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	8.49789810273498
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	9.629731776606107
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	8.107429010606822
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	8.811639522097435
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-√†-vis minorities.	7.711403155305318
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	6.066376305385823
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	6.005444304243042
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	6.430119750834021
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	6.483744918698324
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	6.259420372391558
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	7.496826394377165
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	8.099285979116603
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	8.461898079134585
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	8.503449289249266
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	8.137526093404029
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	7.986031482040187
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	5.740740921926006
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	8.40087811886203
Is this right and proper?	7.799512519703405
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	8.623301541850228
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	10.64309924918405
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	6.723619927495529
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	6.4724539899133084
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	7.35292346838828
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	7.068813627331291
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	7.9132079945770775
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	5.251560654146777
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	7.323922448005885
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	6.675181718538122
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	9.847783360235832
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	7.44943640528981
The post office is democracy.	6.802705124284717
Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000):	8.52376778145763
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	7.998105467121029
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	6.309393181594186
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	8.51148888343576
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	6.486374682142738
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	7.464797203838448
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	7.731634441169462
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking.	8.808032750252258
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	8.29854035905469
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	7.640199177848603
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	7.959072744874771
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	6.014921204138655
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	9.362405899175876
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	7.126874333204124
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	7.735646116104256
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	6.142038891160078
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	8.681175737696266
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	7.049968858319386
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	8.7794698346693
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	6.900547221507343
One can quote from the communication.	6.413939693489185
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	7.249640183509035
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	6.5802950200923105
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	7.262958254136306
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	7.274282723434147
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	7.495288259188595
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	9.89915185173539
We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	6.895906438075281
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	6.368377391517712
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	6.766341956371668
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	9.229563216081218
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	9.78689109664623
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	9.47626686885519
The fourth group is legal certainty.	5.52598212885026
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	7.064871514225902
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	7.587632776819255
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	6.803373240398458
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	6.773018326881961
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal.	6.0133796528233505
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	8.09625111662157
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	7.574797892129601
It should prevent society from splintering.	5.089933227033491
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	8.363867111476267
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	4.9797602116704
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	6.1341689695503705
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	6.860480979026855
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	6.572697975619765
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	8.635741999326891
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	13.860737663952335
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	7.353776419848446
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	8.028484143997392
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	8.185961191072158
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	6.3577775953841895
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	6.879852437106801
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	6.416907915493387
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	6.354961325685091
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	8.659165150474228
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	8.157966671491746
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	4.165156181673728
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	7.002946028978017
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	6.130166479749685
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	8.303065374137622
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	7.947884310811548
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	7.013251906012285
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	7.88777226777109
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	28.12205877761376
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	3.2859845244729637
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	7.240581836704428
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	8.75488904838647
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	7.920861240393781
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	5.99789537346074
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	7.152839509216486
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	8.772122408050745
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	7.958627310674387
Another example is cacao.	4.669426945406963
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	8.774766918425788
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	6.633520721182691
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	9.613682649825599
II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	4.0066030621043005
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	7.28532403863512
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	8.340777940224617
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	8.650527429374383
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	7.417599511375794
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	6.193128287220417
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	6.1288283051448555
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	6.184085149112781
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	8.52781537416132
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	6.3644586206678415
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	8.346917601759845
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	8.97287731459722
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	7.717436737318807
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	4.646630634999935
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	7.044598109789374
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	7.6392959665847116
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	4.662520304981359
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	6.9039818035782
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	7.955883651230017
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	7.146788445723036
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	8.048942884109541
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	6.752056476649024
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	3.3499991439382275
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	8.498154507707216
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	7.601600750551597
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	5.59017815966546
Nothing has changed there.	6.406204773189475
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	8.073590420228554
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	8.197714629168996
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	8.128458739844412
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	6.055206390455802
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	8.196356256743481
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	7.176914606423406
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	9.844041466409049
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	9.347083824057576
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	3.781651358884591
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	5.9631632192747155
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	6.436177256574218
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	10.846033842417876
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	7.203928402761505
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	6.647062793759437
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	6.53567751617579
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	6.204772432348098
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	5.438113560580807
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	4.527967155255533
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	5.716004805618995
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	8.338303720683301
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	7.255211210754797
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	7.0966324757784305
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lom√© Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	8.590030839079784
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	10.910302151016614
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	6.542103396282311
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	8.11507740392447
I hope you will help us.	6.4787855083600965
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	9.715221899100923
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	8.66820625611218
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	6.433440825402625
We will cut them off.	5.990235745758531
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	10.622965780001753
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	4.6518176358941785
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.563489818211283
It has to be redistributed time and again.	7.146868223002445
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	8.878917322894797
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	8.03075100556067
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	6.643080159496175
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	10.163214426452802
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	8.765123756233141
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	5.917223003123813
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	8.620299854317176
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	6.840051039076846
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	7.583131267065548
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	3.6454514306811623
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	9.100743934905774
We have also asked Parliament' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	8.31559728318652
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	7.847428490852026
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	5.298215572817639
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	4.9332666552536395
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	9.485389929870433
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	7.9912470505688376
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	7.963913734715062
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	7.632296644074033
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	7.588782376587972
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	6.683104543129114
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	9.968944872245538
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	7.479045080221167
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	8.830142183405192
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	6.70733636298312
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	8.437099993762969
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	5.84534080447639
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	7.511190173944983
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	7.867540938373061
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Mar√©e noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	8.731870846327237
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	8.353670668349158
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	7.95633955370109
You still have not finished that agenda.	6.935222902817741
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	9.772374125851783
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	7.979978329362322
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	14.891429447379753
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	6.632242810413114
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	7.9921310527981975
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	5.20157021770281
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	7.186640366605891
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	7.803475111214431
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	7.738557069470725
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	8.979283814438885
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	6.906704525277113
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	7.755358803409026
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	7.356868235511049
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	7.587011404546837
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	11.602936360169503
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	5.212161738359186
This has now been done.	7.660727230549662
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	5.64921608971712
I believe that is a good thing	10.804395147975105
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	8.204151729349515
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .	8.766780070229641
The challenge was immense.	3.688079708060459
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, √âmilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	6.022034139250855
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	7.272460233226838
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	3.022077020261865
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	8.559905451892105
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	7.4597964269191905
We share them with everyone on this earth.	6.114484572805001
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	7.484579148430404
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	6.680182380183966
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Sch√ºssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	7.178298993387273
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	8.061783955014876
We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	5.603042872685667
Cyprus and Malta	37.61078828674131
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	6.277385274291204
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	6.624556722928259
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	5.828526459723774
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	6.446019692153845
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	15.188049931258883
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	8.081118510350356
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	7.43817646617194
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	6.813269102431153
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	8.110410168852146
Second Part	46.285069293388226
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	6.5705508815917915
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	4.078414062566437
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	7.310862392586432
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	6.555092738261146
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	3.919735764809032
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	7.883820149712365
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	8.23560343394272
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	7.249406152151485
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	8.751798940400281
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	8.233698491572609
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	6.859914296770314
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	6.608854176072627
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	7.129716526997614
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	9.663567812912477
The EU' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament' s analysis.	8.120625198116125
Congratulations!	46.285069293388226
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	8.312383495331654
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	7.81805574752545
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	10.841093898314572
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	9.097840294476079
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	6.473256474127392
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	6.542188066534279
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	5.023253040595355
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	7.9640621701539045
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	4.274298474622451
Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	6.080728995724683
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	6.555242668816572
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	11.038036326079409
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	3.1291452921269967
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	10.535360729940365
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	6.997636626049075
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	8.112485966814853
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	6.581340337323337
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	7.567715713306599
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	6.406467127826061
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	9.526762045008336
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	7.954795629433663
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	8.551723624773489
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	8.555121213382066
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	6.592141281339074
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	7.62527819949
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	11.987850103596886
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	9.028844166247938
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	7.457254515782296
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	7.892644857409379
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	8.518820419832025
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	8.55635611854028
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	7.093895632395171
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	6.6581357244506405
It should seal their revival.	3.872437156016916
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	5.4683404274124205
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	7.627700466850929
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	5.808567224798494
What is now needed is action.	7.811289491396825
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	8.085780046146024
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	5.593738385146912
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	7.201088588085119
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	8.446912588854774
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	6.604527460696183
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	9.099259900937554
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, on her very serious work.	4.575130489065634
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	3.4778013852986036
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	7.910255532744343
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	6.810086147031822
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	8.469111022030932
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	5.148185146856699
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	11.038266325569891
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	6.692988918332177
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	8.9883962089234
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	7.665399293261905
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	7.2028761827724805
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	8.443236570209203
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	8.711404667404947
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	8.327993328257023
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	9.311473506193916
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	7.134514815455961
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	8.482163000270631
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	6.2249547088315165
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	7.324682652657184
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	4.880862894666358
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	6.068573594590948
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	7.407558005737463
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	6.750281505126944
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	7.697823512373402
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	8.904313740630974
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	8.314586710683034
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	6.698008469005201
It is important that business has legal certainty.	8.219591600624549
VOTE	14.22659668727896
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	6.821866076626569
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	5.124620957416724
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	6.718358279567758
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	7.6228475757235366
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	5.0998342941491
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	7.923070558005257
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	8.056087774341846
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	8.019438846490884
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	8.063685021884016
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	5.416832013858229
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	5.839825015449247
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	9.748207280809046
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	7.36480247231276
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	6.268963634023488
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	6.067682028054175
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	11.438223131006914
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	7.4678122975576375
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	6.403336893747648
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	7.068269926887957
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	11.54700612791752
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	7.501337431663683
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	6.985154088097955
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	8.985709616486025
There are a number of sound amendments.	8.148914337849432
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	7.481473073540612
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	6.4425018083425725
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	5.755413345520221
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	7.791774437240523
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	8.422289990787199
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	5.90266299272809
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	8.06619045928914
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	8.565172423830445
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	6.879963175250537
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	8.760755601656102
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	8.926413917951853
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	7.409122827469564
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	8.206570560767407
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	8.743422038408989
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	11.58924007087011
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	10.717571816990578
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	6.015479404312196
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	7.235407975928048
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.7344522614621696
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	7.958138553597981
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	7.221737074726445
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	8.492213582794296
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	9.165442018532598
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	5.675059840985183
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	7.608457366611131
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	6.367198417757548
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	7.128046647789925
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	7.946964532938635
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	7.525385611664832
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	8.010773764918804
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.644126483541
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	6.888908309435934
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-√†-vis UNMIK.	9.329712436477093
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	7.944819060532962
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	9.510468931633358
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	7.907366509713916
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	4.743995015565266
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	10.291689742871021
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	6.991543884333889
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	8.232548247121112
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.6429848215027345
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	6.990742697504629
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	6.671743118327199
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	7.574286426802203
Our response must be rapid.	2.135059053957683
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	8.891674255894383
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	7.302979299630474
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	12.760502765285322
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	7.031715447957709
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	6.481728996774023
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	7.087832647195768
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	5.683614319591699
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	7.923140764818115
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	8.107235756115228
It is important to remember that.	6.429590626919066
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	6.984033730318153
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	5.8141640582559155
I would like to mention one final point.	6.966422470796967
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	7.642252060601923
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	4.893714471837537
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	6.554619841996951
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	9.805669282248287
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	5.732116068613823
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	8.056761412741299
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	5.992809878030608
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	6.692110774766263
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	6.7736401832822954
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	6.884904673518223
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	1.1438227504289553
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	7.830567386478287
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	6.735454678412678
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	15.109354194925102
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	7.327928423008225
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	7.879156699924646
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	9.011892834898214
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	7.84403637394999
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	10.007476781650702
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	7.759923052992452
This too is unacceptable in my view.	4.84844210946204
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	6.0440542559007175
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	6.972486897556189
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	6.164114622998037
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	11.225385439562684
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	7.4898412487635895
This discussion is not new.	4.425532543839097
I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	7.350588250031914
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	8.247759310076269
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	9.764487832416036
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	6.909054399386797
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	6.725796252089997
But we need that reform process.	12.524593769553908
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	5.909288551615075
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	7.107393411495686
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	8.02604766285064
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	7.781778811992281
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	7.974422489882725
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	5.272749419174906
Parliament is a separate subject.	13.442673259136619
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	7.658760371098278
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	3.687685384858519
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	9.108392041838039
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	7.21678860649238
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	7.078983787862756
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	10.520701917796837
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	9.077231349988628
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	7.723021448500974
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	13.584127335114468
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	7.1170168088804635
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	8.155023945085759
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	7.513000610541928
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	6.755787740421886
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	7.244169795340903
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	6.385473152431433
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	8.685485602494214
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	7.861136777094621
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	10.059177336562858
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	6.871932180273661
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	9.07499993740467
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	7.843397234580759
This is my first additional question.	7.170909603374694
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	6.747936082647145
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	6.6922059122600315
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	6.928160784472936
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	8.67259006128979
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	8.373436008745857
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	9.071092068283521
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	6.697801018211544
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	7.715434295383578
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	5.914517114558367
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	6.270301179028487
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	9.142562527147428
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	5.351427060227448
Question Time (Council)	2.398404949983926
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.249579918294355
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	8.428097751649045
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	9.523919283149791
What about the infrastructures?	13.204987340860312
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	7.144789082708707
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	8.833473274681293
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	9.769119767877426
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	7.3119667089227605
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	5.7080868980486565
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	6.707719908881853
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	6.026610892583946
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	7.781454694097533
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	9.279808241559603
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	3.6584820443120085
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	6.613266232742016
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	8.568123810936438
The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	7.567420811306974
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	10.391296001018741
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	8.643608579313861
How decisions are made is all-important.	7.457652303546311
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	6.423196378840024
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	7.682929007499796
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	6.981809765107069
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	4.212331766396816
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	8.178029297541366
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	6.968878571865549
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.	7.393160820359592
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	7.472205328407723
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	5.349280370139693
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	6.22277473080086
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	9.315903821371323
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob S√∂derman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	6.108521965653291
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	12.172290695404008
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	10.289141785668901
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	9.049592731122116
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	7.07216218001726
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	6.391094315033394
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	9.105802272016321
That is all I have to say for the moment.	9.196513227249806
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	7.705136255190762
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	7.061118641637542
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	8.148893245001277
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	9.95055950071293
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	8.480435689121
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	7.361173246838325
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	8.257440794116286
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	6.153707700213835
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	6.388188682977153
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	5.113184372291106
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	7.679036605878754
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	7.502754000407037
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	5.9947676137980865
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	6.378289780172362
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	7.391341926422093
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	7.3698843176908815
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	5.490944919088388
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	5.802793577397703
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	7.860167760499357
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	2.498203778065475
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	8.33943958097365
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	8.599570691207271
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	6.277730278972511
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	7.9044261004338265
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	8.028301345181616
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	6.421513522854092
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	5.478062119441689
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	10.166546530554017
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	6.679227115328294
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	9.123043294273792
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	8.027840477506297
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	7.068811996256475
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	7.132880562745016
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	6.950133453463193
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	8.665150948300921
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	6.312906165068203
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	7.897612866402084
There must also be savings.	9.565239806535713
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	5.688882925366986
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	4.8161213247753585
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	7.0573248131379795
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	7.084063189089063
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	9.125406401141257
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	11.0544959056175
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	8.195905074342196
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	5.369667970960874
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	7.89258972996765
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	8.36787329216861
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	4.9588993029221395
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	8.392927743224748
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	6.568910486804838
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	5.82910968902255
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	6.456435460043333
That is just the way things are, however.	9.1201443801698
We all very much share this opinion.	6.974179223760593
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	10.97566260360608
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	8.152207293993472
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	8.871750514061134
I thought that it was quite superb.	6.92228510164278
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	9.215999061926334
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	8.219630747934406
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	6.347046287722895
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	5.134205667927982
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	1.2416934119428706
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	6.541810907816217
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	9.558302315660448
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	5.216177217792688
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Sch√ºssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	7.689861157342905
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	4.985667844490724
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	7.051425442853332
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	8.297043563377416
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	8.458675889593838
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	6.702606408080756
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	6.777799247114678
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	6.8013708282311445
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	6.103888982029558
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	6.324605282207574
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	5.702377208731036
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	8.165694622920592
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	9.4712883896142
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	6.416724402587692
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	7.240919217724332
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	5.697878250655169
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	7.679352977603877
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	8.299140563943979
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	7.359730296042629
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	6.2191215543435385
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	5.314237741436738
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.	7.476023395339897
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	6.578971959781104
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	9.475406777006208
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	8.238116428773223
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	4.483693440702367
The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.	9.600748690910716
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	7.830801294347017
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	3.5574276515912464
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	9.665019480673395
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	8.81276607760537
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	2.7049834560650994
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	6.71308114637427
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	7.919375460385189
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	6.929926113124964
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	4.960482951472931
Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	3.7199667448097755
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	9.119142835925176
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	6.846472669789985
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	7.819363513558129
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	8.040797598543874
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	5.916033561079046
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	7.820675123833
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	9.334767093880535
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	7.375123186974945
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	9.388646555711583
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	5.730325204319515
I would like to make three brief points.	7.632177499136029
Such a rule is only normal.	4.313564183874852
Because they have a different level of education.	9.847370913433725
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	8.188412736161503
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	10.047580511755916
You have to admit: this is a joke.	8.921996262599562
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	7.004634291537752
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	7.179340072518289
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	7.958450758319553
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	7.321827088522575
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	7.656638146605429
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	7.735015932204838
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	8.127490486290899
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	6.123774101145003
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	7.227580469821459
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.563489818211283
And now the Erika.	6.243240614638106
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	7.607415374989254
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	8.089543422875442
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	8.818570879582365
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	9.1207435560224
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	6.814704577083793
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	8.414085845015155
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	7.39441282187933
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	6.954755971490929
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	6.788105665157781
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	7.385911334554106
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	9.51568358231757
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	8.333504804202533
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	8.92128024194811
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	3.9323431849543202
.	52.89722204958655
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	10.225541978577676
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	10.241774613641985
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	5.962036578703388
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	7.233746497664239
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	8.165451402322224
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	9.765717432912064
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	7.93651902887519
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	6.532443374388412
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	7.742821133880495
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	6.792945974585214
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	7.620793801196973
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	7.173604526052415
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	7.596490252573559
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	9.340032343621269
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	12.969292766793897
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	6.8040589466204535
	14.22659668727896
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	8.769620264288493
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	7.892777911578839
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	8.534399910107
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	5.874481028861832
What is to be done with this money?	8.947953706532058
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	7.2458064701821545
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	3.2944458725353645
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	7.438156027647327
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	9.2686155089142
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	10.369835346580677
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	9.398014684414687
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	6.356471689340852
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	7.8299121202321285
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	5.635398555446583
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	5.814893720525447
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	6.1933935203508295
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	9.968919807068183
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	5.043450197685409
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	8.266645713959498
This objective deserves our total support.	4.976738980180857
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	9.908259302278262
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	8.171681197548008
.	52.89722204958655
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	5.722874095659955
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	8.122477980544877
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	6.086490200612327
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	7.624682211273146
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	5.119569825235876
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	7.662238934959175
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	7.090723766221374
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	6.250445761296708
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	5.539437635841827
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chev√®nement as the globalised √©lites.	6.55168474433926
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	7.73876198702733
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	7.125428640613902
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	6.4513772528713496
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	8.319309141751015
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	5.789723913727631
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	6.986877990875543
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	5.739155564239934
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	6.211805902182039
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	12.779393935704379
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	9.288628183146923
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	11.017017680544265
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	8.124440631635753
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	8.49755694226481
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	6.079970894112056
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	8.000322644618446
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	9.336562959638089
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	10.407206038367335
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.7508188323455256
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	8.406391850667777
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	7.129425071031819
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	8.019050242825292
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	6.250120120618615
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	6.154373048946967
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	4.988806970337318
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	9.084626273811192
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	7.122060766730822
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	8.827467776280498
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	6.5146147583000085
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	8.877448417615014
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	9.182599306807756
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	8.22972052942435
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	7.920761343937623
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	9.964079623322146
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	6.451955972752364
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy.	7.80643992479573
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	5.444800676986697
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	9.640027216393708
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	7.154637824966761
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	6.511412199027272
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	9.5866614252552
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	9.229965328516473
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.859468634685895
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	6.988827346849341
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	6.513696587248928
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	8.10307855290012
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	6.3737189641757155
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	6.762311763007121
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	7.5324472224142225
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	7.234888859455849
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	11.77721174747292
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	6.889825377823457
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	6.665918462262614
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	7.320897900029031
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	15.224870000338653
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	7.1749546552311925
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	6.674359571348446
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	5.738699002133616
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	8.47661302790247
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	5.757021468581712
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	6.933883973928178
But we shall have a decision very soon.	7.636745915161238
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	8.140525847043845
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	6.663129655901015
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.	7.48385739368382
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	8.820854011446398
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	7.758406716647617
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	8.947880437342665
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	7.102892982233958
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	9.486667797584946
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	6.215080048235264
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lom√© Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	6.252401866633301
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	6.732683668942979
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	6.376098233729694
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	8.750387845219878
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	6.338760646398266
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	10.095620078713274
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	7.761788304898628
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	8.784753388563763
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	6.001488739510328
In itself, globalisation is positive.	8.512725413601054
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	8.51298938350407
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	7.871846055137268
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	7.621690734376168
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	7.574005894732
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	8.172652371246077
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	9.012439461520204
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	10.547428603282686
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	8.552663838518193
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	9.09040301000758
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	10.593756693278255
.	52.89722204958655
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	7.817477856634878
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	9.35610247193642
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.617289813194531
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	6.757564597474183
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	8.317840787917273
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	8.019950350297751
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	7.247215446814633
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	6.177186489866402
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	6.709141557867618
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	7.692123245992017
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	5.705661726242284
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	7.547516368286983
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	8.22021338114891
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	10.167938314423257
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	7.714661759568098
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	7.984271545665142
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	7.344749345869208
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	7.863036619060002
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	6.551785684864161
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	6.591601981938591
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	6.606957374122797
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	9.19212404641544
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	7.21260647876176
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	9.272799909665348
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	6.392758041272113
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	6.114929905555632
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	8.196082101294406
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	9.595104705499436
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	10.0544934606221
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	7.90345552375197
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	5.67941290115206
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	8.822651412340363
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	6.280038661983932
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	9.33618822369509
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	7.922421454450529
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	10.058562649175576
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	4.855702668938439
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	7.517422138638592
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	7.403725349776107
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	8.140582161594404
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	7.138156651895624
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	9.486921468173584
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	6.889694906591116
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	7.357231619216228
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	7.9374504257644825
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	7.341741428264231
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr √Ålvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	7.775919787565348
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	9.565810690706597
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	6.141035254098334
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	3.9958541226548343
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	6.957885037028718
If you ratify ...	3.3368145238252938
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	7.216886744741336
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	6.850045647156442
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	6.38607335731654
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	7.458765863647386
It is only, as stated by Mr Hern√°ndez Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	7.517610545066462
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	7.84525090367502
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	6.341250164835638
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	8.134473921709084
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	6.6568961785215945
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	9.091571321829624
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	6.847097525840473
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	7.889057310262851
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	8.917491013946021
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	12.302794668090854
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	6.748225561782823
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	7.753446562890956
, rapporteur.	1.5178501511678557
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	6.93151778121419
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	7.157354219994482
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	5.676063792995933
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	6.377989693887875
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	7.840825371773562
(SV) This is a very important question.	7.859881232910692
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	7.948774611696246
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	7.478957705886976
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	7.972075526490348
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	6.053205354596142
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	7.335670842223392
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	10.36385820141
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	9.660484105666878
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	11.281634977414539
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	9.04984048991927
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	8.366995232856741
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	6.365310019567439
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	8.300927319088249
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	5.799991705208168
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	7.150623388596291
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	9.329058766008018
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	9.778058784249103
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	7.281980637492307
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	5.629773104492292
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.	9.188338708216024
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	7.99326477270605
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	6.895545444168782
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	5.390961303598022
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	11.392060599143644
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	8.88951430351266
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	9.556794309273409
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	7.488702939008242
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	8.901676955331537
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	9.700929166448642
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	6.742084938025886
The √ñVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	5.030577765794455
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	1.8920006773388363
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	7.166308271129899
Some of them are our ACP partners.	4.875898343092083
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	6.52907055372073
All this is happening on a daily basis.	6.901319457426461
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	7.044631510582762
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	7.295713665567332
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	9.774265169422886
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	10.663384549482524
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	5.477402890071268
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	9.048414622987107
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	5.967318975418547
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	7.453268996823281
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	6.880912949486171
Let us grab our chance.	7.841935470913619
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	9.810374922897191
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	7.203308504418998
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	8.18807127390677
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	8.626430667737912
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative.	7.546811329258565
So much for the political aspect.	8.469169324217518
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	7.578008409618887
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	7.402131994829118
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	7.863231869908592
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	8.238814558949061
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	7.615309975267403
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	6.4999459338588395
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	5.687042129263968
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	9.022872417739832
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	9.295175577129138
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	7.0842121477730915
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	7.932541764942357
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	4.526069381712165
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	8.137224779640412
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	4.280057189029896
That shows that competition really is working.	7.102307276555659
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	6.832286158196435
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	4.505999501363128
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	7.608516594677863
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	7.22398872156853
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	5.985707323666837
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	7.595186412465218
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	7.506739419996261
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	7.227604962878396
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	9.110329663145427
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	6.779470409646261
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	5.968201052815613
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	6.417330699020996
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	4.791459493360438
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	7.982735274658956
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty, the end of the nation-state, and so on. But the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in France, including British student, Isabel Peake, who was thrown off a train, shows why we need mutual recognition.	6.30511432326901
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	8.302407038856387
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	8.5806028560085
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' √™tre. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	7.918070404566145
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	4.28309727736982
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	10.481148383322626
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	5.453788780152027
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	10.615573734438206
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	7.967093863491037
.	52.89722204958655
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world.	6.122314922621439
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	5.652589111974286
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	8.513067532124214
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	7.381447434670887
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	7.019612842924347
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	7.931627176682223
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	6.722886259045556
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	9.471745237414968
We are talking about us, not Austria.	7.599637142514907
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	4.252324463232312
Disparate actions are not effective.	6.304225238542659
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	6.650435045114117
	14.22659668727896
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.3146471262555792
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	6.933618144189686
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	8.390407540971887
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	9.89950373453968
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	5.727548678600411
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	5.669864841919591
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	6.318092829284866
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	6.8329604359630824
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	9.664642946874741
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	5.572060120249163
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	6.777867359851511
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	5.914548879458546
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	8.577851239060362
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	7.093561894227152
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	6.6411108019213785
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	7.455690714994955
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	8.73853079929975
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	8.009090194571087
The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	8.474633472678397
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	7.6326747144974565
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	6.467594975566843
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	5.673175259094649
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	6.543429554497872
As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	7.387954939993615
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	3.8302365982226374
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	7.482833441329369
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	4.224930390942133
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	5.987441864202093
Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	8.572254341385834
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	7.283925980356422
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	8.249333848940912
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	10.606036319551897
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	7.307975628525694
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	5.857038915103825
The disease is always fatal.	6.23518287608218
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	5.818797571085587
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	9.26153607534438
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	4.282503039625048
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	7.959796275694854
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	9.80091503930665
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	6.523459336780521
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	7.113418967527589
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	7.847964113069622
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	8.04264198358602
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	8.495391978621342
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	4.547749925458056
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	6.1530826942324905
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	9.101672897152755
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	8.427782105968321
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	7.564594285086827
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	7.210984034354913
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	8.603078224770263
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	7.1736913582380915
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	7.765071850869128
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	7.975525564921595
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	6.605956197516758
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	8.970459190858843
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	6.85119057179815
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	5.879735683133578
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	8.203996567452998
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	8.206202081913283
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	6.448689985181641
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	8.058383728220136
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	7.532653587018221
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	7.318865754217301
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	6.999538504954547
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	6.808019389116052
The population was not allowed any input.	5.662217327571175
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	7.170862703188395
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	7.655280350760855
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	6.903616383097335
This is not the case here.	9.201077218408177
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	8.28100175354991
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	7.668460747821785
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	5.029710870522844
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	5.348426756380639
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	8.204781965495306
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	7.133732261912828
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	6.363141787384558
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	3.327353830009038
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	4.460511017758038
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	8.296955056824187
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	7.979819731767484
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	6.906100643240379
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	8.358648041932545
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	7.594186405013028
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	9.229246636204127
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	7.625076184330087
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	6.930233631668318
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	9.487390759736602
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	7.317720373219768
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	8.804456303098293
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	8.264568840360841
Many speakers have underlined this.	10.687490037431957
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	8.959839852904626
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	3.204932727349928
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	5.993368444465265
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	7.350252002918698
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.6429848215027345
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	6.8896346952649745
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	5.76841909398511
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	7.301137503428112
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	9.977003148357436
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	5.246033017301669
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	10.029840619207102
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	7.272765423263635
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	7.856988156334668
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	6.9552740909730835
Is this actually how we want things done?	6.352463127930115
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	10.308131457591301
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	7.5681571888635215
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	6.6075180994944445
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	8.505594164097976
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	7.386938124520943
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	7.678585925099861
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	7.884541935447867
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	8.136218521011461
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	11.25575798034326
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	7.693902790110396
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	9.67041361439376
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	6.42915424681593
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	6.982815418622136
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	8.597628704158172
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	9.057951942476107
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	8.417560126408194
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	6.186761663307805
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	7.529457074151104
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	6.130211944024228
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	9.759825853228909
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	5.432715469326125
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	8.357643329806775
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	7.120742893204835
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	8.898765330183142
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	9.882307118662716
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.859468634685895
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	8.011667378154923
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	8.10810838891343
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	6.091726161478189
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	6.95284326241655
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	8.02839380248356
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	12.315113440669437
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	5.91140733785449
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	6.736833841409816
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	4.21605589490396
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	7.0012790846955
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	7.0313782732666965
I do not agree.	40.42858202427661
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	7.105831469234454
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	6.76107157060721
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	4.740919965419899
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	8.92841938696989
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	8.49031487943197
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	8.284266122725256
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	7.87252317638602
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	7.468495615864907
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	5.4379683544135675
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	6.961483755407499
The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	6.9644974496740675
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	7.149164321253968
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	8.586231231696841
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	8.283883685180319
What can the Commission do about that?	6.421498077146319
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	6.33066157779596
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	8.58898565614768
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	8.396829191365189
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	8.577719351658072
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	5.593729753342767
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	6.3493606712975454
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	11.837541616577296
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	8.915893364627628
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	8.494668598245735
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	5.841329257778499
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	7.825764698736081
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	8.527552437758859
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	6.723248728274461
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	7.421721453658975
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	6.273555695756208
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	6.7784674230229545
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	6.235783177928249
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	7.070310123039752
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	6.5803838315540615
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	14.05929745618603
I would like to explain our thinking here.	13.523569914334018
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	7.373812635939932
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	6.484052544631406
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	8.635144489183316
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	7.781894089284926
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	8.151472320927448
We know what actually happened.	8.649218863190095
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	4.938674405871449
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	8.445967330009926
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	6.238265856091529
Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.	8.000380621647006
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	5.379109009926856
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	6.715224599024765
Why should this be the case?	9.165122557079728
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	10.270553271751329
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	7.802066749079657
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	8.170071922477437
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	4.781585226797011
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	8.014795217542199
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	7.649696529694298
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	8.295594670064549
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	4.807143884364453
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	8.466662362922522
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	9.112657024495382
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	6.963717452381923
The challenges are different.	6.72662548735324
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	5.430528193106151
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	6.056295258146119
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	6.770785809345925
(DA) Mrs Cederschi√∂ld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	6.058485217350735
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	7.113331109750849
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	5.844464683878731
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	7.3196144928465765
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	7.597791662939188
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	7.584913085311872
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	6.008326806377461
It is important to point this out.	6.387393362219778
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	6.993249915172211
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	7.017453677319787
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	7.874392459220101
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	7.0061791528165225
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	7.178029930554388
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	8.437125833585863
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	7.784408287869289
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	8.897414828494455
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	6.5451688228237614
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	9.144479728300176
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	8.71158213243554
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	8.86287672466535
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	7.055275915732234
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	6.709366701730633
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	8.387914831071406
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	1.162056305492263
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	6.844807138647555
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	7.158553699737015
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	6.463067479917128
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	8.659946232419466
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge D√≠ez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	5.800460371610541
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.8426244090514676
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	8.076967457915973
(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	5.7111779404598115
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	7.031391912064913
I am disappointed in the EPP.	4.777974343923475
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	6.801634352986518
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	7.397019322209009
We must be very vigilant.	10.27562950414293
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	8.54258950566627
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	7.5459142348378
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	8.29819898220547
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	7.048210804618077
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	8.240961618950784
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	8.313311758017834
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	6.673590166496038
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	9.700768136483333
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	5.787501018589063
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	8.028142603545897
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	8.758211107056347
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	8.023212590007322
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	7.606245590213381
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	7.373493344080895
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	4.219546964936858
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	6.636439774437265
I was able to talk to Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	7.5709324772890865
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level.	9.906634056580133
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	5.440994131297168
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	9.155967947416853
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	8.693279619291856
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	7.507967567572098
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourri√®re, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	6.049593014671783
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	6.178428460136586
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	7.184707106869018
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	4.191294128704002
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	10.163369074566774
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	12.039146398952852
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	6.788077426833002
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	4.8681360856738385
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	9.077616933125904
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	8.519866766043789
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	6.840499682407086
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	9.5018147302225
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	8.94149981415199
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	6.521521045181013
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	6.9705519511291545
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	7.950114481690935
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	8.909683885694763
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	9.569653034900476
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr B√∂ge referred to will be asked.	7.818106588461367
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	8.820239614043723
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	7.467277675728162
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	7.123061930890251
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	8.183496827220727
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	8.033823338052338
It has become eminently political.	7.551015054676665
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	7.412645515603818
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	6.874432243401252
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	7.266382252467359
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	6.354596604325883
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	9.264154916778677
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	8.147470712328786
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	6.722589476780244
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	9.437330384292691
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	8.51714151040348
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	6.143988879656616
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	6.790709803789277
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	8.926624082374396
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	11.460522963509433
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	5.929506730307651
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	7.267929320816402
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	7.700648202655598
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	7.611057562431394
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	6.663937663058543
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	7.295797949292397
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	5.675494899202109
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	8.45435873763621
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	6.52315143385632
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	7.4160331854741885
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	7.002283594848238
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	8.035688156405907
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	6.329261064444198
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	7.218313631874318
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	8.124234318504735
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	7.597962659638841
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	9.94242968990355
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	9.043718035649357
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	7.174358844949416
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	7.444435859696406
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	9.25153856220444
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	6.88508165509861
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	8.286472692555122
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	5.630487678040732
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	8.229938590628697
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	7.428491370373329
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	8.613424363013522
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	6.161401328898184
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	2.8772569534497503
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	8.763803226413033
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	6.805637917445965
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	8.31235218398803
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	10.483023702360052
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	4.724268734591139
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	7.093071537634087
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-√†-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	9.946621924687303
The joint debate is closed.	2.116534418917134
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	10.973973956301089
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	7.514965844879535
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	7.905588708042731
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	7.262434335502869
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	6.399538548533335
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	5.73292306801629
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	9.088878769143577
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	6.630819754321135
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	6.544739188488988
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	11.143311688457212
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	8.352229677036435
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	6.8700677046374565
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	8.659309693660905
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	7.944659158671073
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	8.609782123873652
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	7.712984372913402
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	7.218220663885339
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	8.706862309256103
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	7.944632945178182
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	6.723303267001846
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	9.589158538130398
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	8.169305740023505
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	5.280727447937372
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	6.696817786040842
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.1969809890142433
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	3.7021906797433672
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	8.466343815051545
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	8.377450456251683
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	6.742685866724858
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	8.814371672497877
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	2.3885196056490168
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, M√°rio Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	10.142849674990533
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	7.497564184905724
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	8.37648551297259
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	7.818735676827263
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	8.820373434357615
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	6.870164135096618
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	5.042899785775043
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	5.970957028654569
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	8.601759398691467
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	5.796205224528974
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	5.231546213085921
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	9.69276285931045
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	7.51941746515167
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	7.1963647796836945
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	7.403784902078388
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	5.833421208779332
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	4.559978022306728
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	7.765822585679085
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	5.264830715745521
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	9.859129408986442
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	4.077546460608108
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	7.759900068108571
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	7.222386634077189
We shall now move on to Question Time.	5.546086030539767
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	10.522293925037166
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	9.17732114125717
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	7.654286745785661
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	8.510815552749133
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	7.5975554820778255
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	6.240104806391354
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	8.613969101822219
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	8.250799760207453
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	5.195321729188754
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	7.488429662478801
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	4.83246654563634
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	4.605810777756878
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	7.402829167498081
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	7.238032526003036
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	3.9369047292598474
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	7.338136957216898
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	5.379076367266625
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	6.51960422585928
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	7.216681186645355
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	7.07533401513321
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	6.113804340291338
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	8.282883581287306
From here on things are going to be easier.	7.660009009946406
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	7.3041235272165
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	6.924388662406907
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	6.696291432135803
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	7.556497915024426
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	5.607380430965435
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	7.70341564220306
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes J√∂rg Haider' s party.	7.639008737520378
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	7.87733793886958
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	7.544803720703346
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	6.446836984819868
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	7.558412139771172
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	9.158176462481688
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	7.418678627277957
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	8.437221012211007
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	7.09724614421809
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	7.215475353382146
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	7.84602238576839
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	6.0198771795139505
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	4.856065399924363
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	8.907185460897635
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	7.155562290584493
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	7.989694262101475
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	8.685195757156004
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	6.906828211041985
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	5.624835125508818
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	6.369820861024311
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	6.788657461570888
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	7.549417216669985
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	2.4567234167477148
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	7.921290194137746
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	11.239764562300453
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	7.886477035762706
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification.	7.0627021160625505
I hope the House will understand that.	13.70416046669256
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	6.67122456392384
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	6.529909274858982
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	7.877049163773127
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	8.224593818233425
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	7.820812810849128
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	6.5728548977332935
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	7.097554395559474
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	6.9861570684082555
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	8.863903410960953
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	4.957419638776331
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	6.885853611033552
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandb√¶k did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	7.199537864891904
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	8.6951602103637
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us.	6.73735234095063
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	8.359854146006773
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	12.363046118332187
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	7.0542277949312
Recourse to the precautionary principle	1.6547676397242819
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	7.873776991974149
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	9.650324494647615
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	7.23664923692659
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	5.636398450066991
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	8.748735521891117
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	4.3688102838078
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	6.379455368214191
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	8.076194785453787
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	7.434268841165442
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	7.63129893679495
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	7.0053154891916884
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	7.428179561550675
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	10.530182826087916
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	5.972186462759624
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	6.8035780717173555
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	6.116064694750406
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	8.374227209308158
This is an important matter.	5.569310179088218
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	8.802991056758495
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	6.490463756034412
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	9.617327515284424
Thank you, Mrs D√ºhrkop D√ºhrkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	6.426397025794472
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	8.262151948163265
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	7.163120926527177
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	6.488151006907098
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	5.577810073498154
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	10.543866228536809
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	6.960315572004872
Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	7.467853229433526
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	6.037832762200234
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	6.215582972624756
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	6.558821491743384
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	8.472172524451913
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	7.992428999623272
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	7.412137264879775
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	7.8718058803643185
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	5.852052419335631
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	7.122122327973681
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	8.022535208515222
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	5.73672897825141
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	3.319034124654359
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	7.763250180503703
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	6.463780983086804
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	4.104338398853899
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	5.523262623797646
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	7.698534028425546
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	8.625722325437719
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	9.422804695040558
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	6.417295106037179
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	4.508124175827455
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	6.977338919581869
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	8.272718626810738
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	6.062295965200005
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	9.262808988579012
Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	7.596796436471478
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	11.440604488663329
If they yield, they are lost.	7.488324874525153
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	8.648146510920087
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	8.136242994593617
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	7.1518597048215415
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	5.4824862822923865
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	11.022382484327633
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	7.933851175423487
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	7.011000083545402
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	8.271558915444448
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	6.966791775156803
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	7.871685124025414
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	7.760521986647302
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	7.408224280594212
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	6.138319102773032
It is a report which tries to give direction.	9.751231267700431
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	6.843544645600445
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	6.585012407546321
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	6.3472741529055705
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	10.038368115004216
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	3.3567761926006363
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	6.707452797711681
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	4.539358514768708
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	6.8816919213514645
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	9.676320849816436
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	8.062687771680345
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	6.957915398788056
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	7.988738077534161
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	9.189632575447312
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	7.349942032329078
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	7.522657325044372
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	6.384312770949769
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	6.341223674189647
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	6.919321993544635
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	8.432183034123687
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation.	7.554173554346671
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	6.2985881601407225
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	6.167990854173637
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	10.088555810318805
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	6.6966549461600575
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	4.348896625319059
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	8.430092130549136
This needs to be said!	23.750126271012114
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	8.949728930055516
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	7.66303735692779
My second question is of a critical nature.	5.187102821250873
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	8.591437872429044
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	7.424888035154107
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	4.732482611974236
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	8.497049249370209
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	9.390327954255925
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	5.476733546745613
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	13.498456008864201
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	5.967978288232743
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	8.48732830005865
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	11.658250905217978
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	6.530705151611048
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	6.694698317718391
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	9.034487420995712
But thank you for your remarks.	6.808892897857769
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	7.124958784740767
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	5.378973231697821
That is most certainly relevant.	6.042899030851932
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	6.894112674839289
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	10.207336542904912
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	7.609865105366929
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	8.44143081357918
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	5.225446397593308
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	8.707029065850922
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	11.331948090153977
I cannot accept this.	5.221605522841742
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	7.36340345735595
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	7.057247909174057
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	10.073462486187978
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	7.439527948123933
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	8.812228366514596
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	5.649196439155935
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	8.523686094971705
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	6.969446749247417
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	7.565459440849109
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	8.773531685706997
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	11.11669820232028
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	7.187859054666124
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	2.5164422543132785
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tom√°s y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge D√≠ez, of the Basque police force.	6.036728719084079
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	7.133421086519681
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	6.725127421692022
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	8.339288972514453
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	3.751179775515136
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	7.150959517562522
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	7.946658620523042
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	7.441227732179888
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	7.584267164719084
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	6.079467832996857
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	9.04691044597674
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	8.083095416835503
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	6.880473246677017
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	7.018769406780437
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	5.88181783701945
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	7.142463448281182
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	7.532577176386235
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	7.031140338025047
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	9.69014241047096
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	9.183246469231658
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	8.065488350616947
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	5.800229466483951
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	6.251120613065417
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	4.972255312566064
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	8.060879712495819
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	6.810232383549743
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	6.498432682560664
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	9.09167508627794
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	6.3934709542367205
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	8.090640686668486
That is naturally unacceptable.	5.541176856757824
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	8.413051903076141
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	6.215494562501168
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	7.182614563291644
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	8.007059159788255
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	6.858430326736574
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	6.242865475081995
The Lom√© Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	5.372330766543587
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	7.435685176872921
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	7.254659511516832
A very important proposal indeed.	15.835057237179672
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	5.731074111581576
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	4.901153227036577
I would also like to make a more general point.	7.628811619166615
Women belong to different social classes.	5.921228720149627
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	7.055036427588207
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	6.643269141735991
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	13.053001267842332
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	8.151864378856382
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	9.842995421031677
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	6.693846806601503
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	8.051723998130623
Union Economy (1999)	2.3184967407640977
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	7.036721010340316
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	6.364301420739456
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	12.227484670786518
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	7.633822283390048
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	8.102344302411414
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	6.373013399108233
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	8.154169187914732
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	8.750980550237752
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	6.908958504344472
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	10.145461571855835
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	5.912465975862628
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	9.39255943945123
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	7.12873054471888
That time is now past.	6.89389765409241
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	10.899798705364857
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	13.047361699685874
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	8.288375394557212
For example, it has not been defined.	14.86464411114968
I also welcome the White Paper.	4.827173593892897
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	8.351164114636315
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	2.369767973166377
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	8.394017428902519
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	7.58089891740853
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	6.101203589415928
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	6.424395569432172
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions.	7.175532542884576
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	7.882860536972146
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	8.728969089475791
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	7.072639344364564
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	8.553247380224931
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	7.962874270101216
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	6.356699719057211
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	6.998054731893597
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	9.78948688652393
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	8.031817549939019
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	4.452667634211812
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity.	7.015995508157265
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	7.895888629426027
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	7.851327636896916
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	7.762970110093029
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	8.634723573027745
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	7.935284707077615
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	7.552147600013619
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	8.502668665604729
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	8.284948587611762
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	8.466938018821113
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	7.642022094965853
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	8.009648199100921
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	8.73061853278551
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	9.197262687539576
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	1.7953177119572696
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	10.196355388522317
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	7.84061787066447
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	6.784257924017714
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	7.861158639746212
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	5.41403339376975
I want to refer to the political position here.	15.629092188578525
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	9.915482224101538
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	5.835672424959021
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	12.983179800644491
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	6.550280849126739
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	7.791937764032234
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	7.976702318234193
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	7.9830544188082335
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	6.193401326803868
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	9.184513785061947
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	8.744948433739989
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	7.348929803444135
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	7.861918928368986
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	5.892661946375937
This is why we are abstaining.	7.653892426638153
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	8.0828207617118
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	8.238231506241926
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	6.2948655311569555
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	6.509305292221829
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	5.478262845642904
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	7.925325310420426
Statement by the President	60.524374266279246
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	7.24404315981436
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	7.129960786567474
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	8.22589722982415
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	9.248749571570459
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	4.584029760425064
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	7.7681072368018
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	6.032631492964053
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	8.10026802231707
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	5.140067276576573
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	6.742671427825438
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	5.326599304553492
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	12.000577110801185
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	8.408816167656685
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	4.151221845599078
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	7.632478282882489
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	7.861254335817167
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	5.687559921954795
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	6.429217821456383
Everything else is wishful thinking.	5.79518719278434
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	7.902805821921705
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	8.991154962638312
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	9.544000594250543
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	6.099347798696148
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	6.855487970158881
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	7.767976795397759
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	7.691905744034427
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	7.8329171068701635
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	7.955390441819531
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	5.98533271985742
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	6.234889046785646
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	2.808610985998277
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	6.6555854299951225
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	6.849057612155022
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	6.776895471763484
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	5.959300811511676
We have made our views very clear to them.	7.011445569514302
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	4.528240827875442
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	7.420587401366957
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	8.174417909234108
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.498667569455823
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	7.899647195356994
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	9.155050937138116
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	2.4405678493214933
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	8.863232465348773
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	10.68457466320131
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	6.68801996068131
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	6.867253914246492
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	5.327514981407102
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	9.498014880391917
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	6.906261679063372
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	6.865154833379291
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	8.2469610332849
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	8.513730160722222
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.644126483541
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	5.597278359761073
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.	6.663368743174815
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	6.670490960948578
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	7.696671066900522
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	10.22299298109425
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	6.720967236472265
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	7.756953103214144
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	7.308360484449025
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	8.083279445407532
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	6.62782240949373
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	8.815074966354807
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	5.734485418636448
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	5.738975225881695
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	7.251117851255549
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	7.615789266675837
This is not the case!	10.023756870402687
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	11.495440727099842
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	8.855477025791194
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	6.691071921669649
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	7.71015814737722
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	7.425357013426605
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	6.195804902332709
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	11.053005687529279
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	6.229379072665628
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	5.863151555808025
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting.	7.695406766176634
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	6.681745008468164
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	8.212750869424266
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	11.540321981821704
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	7.497335810774178
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	8.097848224857533
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	8.487877429415075
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	6.264054161637096
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	7.606622006265615
Capital tax	46.285069293388226
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	6.468935775258107
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	7.692179594913704
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	8.411629155342633
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	9.31606619803901
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	3.198732507126224
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	7.871727573372933
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	6.965229517452986
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	8.06164086252144
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	9.414437843211688
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	7.815724278771932
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	9.271825194437854
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	7.245329439758105
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	5.475019775938475
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	7.819199218318612
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	7.324056956971037
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	7.491599073619069
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	6.7040754999987575
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	7.904553052241599
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	7.635757942312056
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	7.781775989288177
It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	8.081491996154309
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	8.074383023710237
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	7.101081248716922
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	6.727450315757744
The people of Angola deserve better.	14.069117379690537
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	7.674561859354459
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	6.674447840812092
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	6.189986351989074
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Do√±ana.	8.179081007730323
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	7.342704995645377
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	7.595133220109377
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	7.664573874872365
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	6.436109183905109
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	8.970938669192174
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	8.654830351927616
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	6.5396736557296204
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	7.633638531830213
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	9.53445385380985
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	9.014386513806116
It must be known.	27.4045694350751
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	8.1789592772584
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	6.35972924476372
I am proud to support such a resolution.	6.465139299505061
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	8.611030066001195
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	7.800162701801003
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	6.583586130585195
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	9.937247330971942
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	8.393836780679846
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	4.7899903631345255
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	5.462459072918617
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	7.3314416016462305
Answers are still awaited.	4.757570337921358
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	6.247265758229939
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament.	5.982608304060762
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	2.0457455543214076
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	5.890556143644562
We want to talk about coherence.	12.185780523749315
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	6.983875374774007
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	6.200405645077746
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	6.603821040770894
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	8.0349424029883
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	3.6116757482849295
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	8.374660169501444
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	8.19439846073972
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	8.610929860081391
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	8.296733700447948
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	6.350023847326833
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	5.670984157303608
We must live with our consciences."	5.221405377061768
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	7.525437794885094
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	5.499567312363305
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	7.257054545805484
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	7.0723628316550275
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	6.627846407817488
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	5.559856241818237
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	10.191494427407525
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	8.56033810156489
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	9.906134802327868
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	11.206857861904538
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	6.9643371147360495
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	8.401423627118364
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	6.620658557566262
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	5.602312607624344
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	7.72710901608656
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	6.998139813520349
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	5.965889461418024
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	8.69341870841032
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	7.911313955445399
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	7.565380686077119
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	8.641521790868525
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	7.582529082032556
I endorse this view.	6.057079388643061
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	7.087070910409083
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	7.451066528991056
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	8.878146949744925
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	6.364043024685333
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	6.679362386283097
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	6.554281722555311
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	7.964378081909099
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	8.610620265012177
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	6.746472106100112
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	10.037002653880137
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	7.717940170645425
I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so.	7.078292839408543
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	7.747640629076345
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	5.558822326874135
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	6.4659960824575435
The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)).	2.5341845964657947
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	5.482189731986615
(Applause from the PSE Group)	2.689926333551363
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	7.972224814500251
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	8.365420552999705
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	8.227472742322828
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	6.952659500576591
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	7.490125556303688
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	8.544794722766401
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	7.135732147264071
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	10.038175052633356
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	5.554494550733027
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	6.817762883995553
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	5.780281420497554
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	6.986843191134931
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	7.7378246092166805
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	8.331131381359775
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	5.655221126168813
This time, however, it is true.	8.299798415245416
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	4.563879009812765
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	6.345570169589252
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	5.965656178686067
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	7.933917701227179
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	6.62263271065907
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000.	5.26334016801684
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	8.063548447595931
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	7.416225174148371
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	6.341789989802135
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	10.907064428508724
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	6.937147380027073
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	4.722522863162169
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	5.706649617386093
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	7.6459345340296485
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	6.997870428508832
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	7.350785153992881
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	8.724523987238626
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	11.979185607772878
Women are systematically raped.	3.9462843316742466
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	9.648091687994322
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	6.420740422138529
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	9.210041038548825
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	6.533275831365534
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	7.99606676692884
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	6.619998647593754
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	7.093214537152111
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	7.4356687131155885
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	7.9352683374777495
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	8.26059316340444
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	13.175252405154724
LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	8.063135142243281
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	6.52038761170545
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	7.08269460890699
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	7.759643497792323
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	7.770635405842715
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	8.336001808884875
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	6.201957315759268
What establishes a recognised minority?	3.0152060556195774
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	9.012773700763338
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	8.678292766007905
In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats.	9.685996259166554
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	5.883864890637165
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	12.372483117194312
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	6.564240437140013
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	6.762594638062258
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	7.341825605068952
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	8.633712218102078
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	5.744098071152245
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	7.099874807489085
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	7.300872419494943
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	8.559368525437437
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.	11.364321502725588
This question covers several individual matters.	4.802828030170116
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	5.532103216575686
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	6.790733312093308
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	7.332190033707707
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	8.102513636632793
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	5.688685327215312
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	7.917989532075473
We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future.	9.713860414789252
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	8.756395697586788
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations.	6.736221081223254
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	6.919170242448374
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	5.635427605617455
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	5.982333080224807
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	10.391315871055406
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	6.945917041044851
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	7.900964865602282
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	6.682866240602694
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	8.684797551694993
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	9.59882229006347
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	6.7976354580487115
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	9.347898840842937
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	8.121829130626983
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	6.98977420118847
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	6.68938217202528
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	9.40733217059101
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	7.1845236613004655
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	6.8511994862640835
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	8.700402477091155
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	5.65258194263195
Women in the decision-making process	2.3292666374662394
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	6.659711010255575
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the √ñVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	7.406578145368614
Second part	46.285069293388226
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	5.174193608258839
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	8.238751652464698
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	8.01898197901925
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	9.029083477635936
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	6.703986551534299
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourri√®re report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	5.861504123073694
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	7.654963295026229
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	8.653228513572927
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	7.2544051076207605
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	8.173644771964982
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	7.210878502958748
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	6.432081892019861
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	7.141186183874428
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	7.4390119420093015
However, more work is needed on this.	8.138763392663643
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	5.819348961184472
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	6.923563182521208
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	7.776778002323959
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	6.6438015502681464
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	8.160039877639646
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	8.364261273109932
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	7.577862778836744
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	7.347414022309158
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	5.833549837173824
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	8.407988190257115
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	9.615187303806193
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	10.340794084802754
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	6.23451327308434
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	3.591295236804316
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	6.040844578090122
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	7.420797523787857
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	6.736347399145449
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	9.106282479376215
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	9.817107641126373
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	8.594112118562899
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	7.8629030318857165
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	6.7999886414580475
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	5.520380121870073
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	7.2433582185508385
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	6.301067191792696
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	8.19592051891555
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	6.818070716129826
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	6.237879801839651
The matter is still open.	8.098991183721456
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	8.220222684408029
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	6.345903382899755
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	8.72582531905692
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	7.175596232082136
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	9.198422125181443
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	7.007355469539301
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	6.2763461200678154
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.868214225053703
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	7.158724906793331
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	6.530285794155465
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	4.811327935803501
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	10.885078632788973
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	6.609248061243096
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	5.143475956396052
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	6.2584029468471805
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	6.1575596620604625
There is more to be said on that score.	10.393666170174019
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	6.3017779047767295
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	7.13585441345341
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	5.143894751620901
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	8.276491968901901
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	7.616020583058693
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	12.502229570480306
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].	5.762297447272674
Report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS))	1.8078117454726728
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	8.608875431324517
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	6.783029762651186
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	7.064173047822739
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	7.9036646414517335
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	6.904787335977816
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	5.996451025934771
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	1.5880891133152706
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	6.7993004558693375
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	7.168465475145535
I have two further points to make on this process.	8.270610414592834
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	6.709691457211291
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	9.680663165152163
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	7.312659196836056
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	6.214468195845869
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	7.521492278118107
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	7.500544820504333
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	9.428502106054292
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	6.813667473339756
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	6.413411247954637
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	7.962125924973402
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	4.848554514540865
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	6.115431844417054
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	7.449018633496397
'Restore hope' , do you remember?	15.70194803792619
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	5.704043044406909
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.	5.79969579369187
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	7.2284808135491865
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	7.805415096139484
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	6.392249337280729
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	6.759743480489077
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	7.448798275892241
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	7.143003359970496
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	6.622000017617306
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	6.724215766565006
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	5.719733225553315
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	6.594704466302545
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	7.100528143092533
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	6.242477029780153
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	5.904148914570707
That is my first question.	8.805809976004895
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	7.857772146185953
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	7.382962815049868
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	5.753973810730282
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	8.464184243695005
Everyone is free to hold such views.	5.143312655871052
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	8.34950573640796
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	9.419461747595573
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	7.62647040634219
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	7.534349736011115
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer?	7.407494507416737
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	8.664151864201896
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	8.482982048307715
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	6.5404917613373605
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	7.624544947066382
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	5.871866983995658
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	8.111356033905304
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	7.047633851513151
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	5.82523335666593
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	6.714487284119206
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	8.006203673983617
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	6.885819612162369
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	7.925282911784547
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	4.742511824277415
They want to see results.	15.315705317855269
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and G√ºtesiegel.	7.244239855780019
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	8.313028758142147
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	4.325024582802175
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	7.972157875130227
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	4.480234313554598
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	8.232356908691322
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	8.569726822345574
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	6.4497232546068055
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	6.370057244599248
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	5.864604554796289
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	6.946681662911938
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	7.781853499334252
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	3.3742235683932265
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	5.9655693641807
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	6.1268870140522855
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	7.752304259380635
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	6.515597452802343
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	7.449701076229131
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	7.431607380025528
I agree with your analysis.	12.940199701720749
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	6.224597839819552
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	7.585684193060612
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	7.044608132607836
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	10.52503852818142
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	7.428025069239997
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	6.407022605508864
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	7.390752115378546
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	8.07768558208145
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	5.610113729037278
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	6.841395852401526
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	5.4564710869066575
We have to act now, before it is too late.	9.003278709868278
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	8.307913751046462
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	7.370753653745033
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	4.439372369096104
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	5.548115876222943
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	8.119341659692338
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	6.239539527761298
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	9.580203274661827
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	7.677829771645174
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.97923631452936
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	9.232349058617187
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschi√∂ld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	6.872978476423911
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	5.351928857092742
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	8.040048467947006
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Bar√≥n Crespo's motion.	7.980340171914617
The denominations of the euro are well known.	9.56871351846204
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	8.532708560737836
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	8.050326319164318
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	8.424893136637136
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	19.72205176446525
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	7.003771423588534
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	8.505598362925559
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	5.467098913839928
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	7.72121300771172
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	7.6520034809054005
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	9.674664892552402
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	6.921594146650194
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	7.064747557756845
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	10.217645815529862
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	8.509000943428395
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	7.634635411184541
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	8.17468859421114
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	7.753064216555752
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	6.427187316374521
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	7.518619490505262
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	5.9446727695684025
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	6.136043819468626
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	7.446328587060067
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	10.360865337519233
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	7.98265569532738
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	7.302498239043364
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	9.744078061137094
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	6.397555208766727
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	4.6359098358414865
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	5.980446163712126
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	7.401338424272596
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	7.644575467273567
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	9.27084393456377
We need to do something about it.	5.97342400628119
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	8.840956168715653
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	6.227895083126683
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	7.649832433534394
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	10.431198492142801
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	8.409893641117277
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	9.050239298513832
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	8.584255227143718
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	7.032279440233518
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	3.5849209551765124
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	6.228499195772925
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	8.70057034017234
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	12.39454394092873
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.	12.522126069618107
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	10.20096405737118
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	6.529020245358547
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	10.1321469271188
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	7.996763054347028
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	8.437129984534263
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Gra√ßa Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	1.874324258090302
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	8.06944880060196
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	10.620697835522913
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	5.344952385152214
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	6.472942691623707
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	8.110544713435559
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	1.2264779583237335
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	10.34946644627531
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	7.88035158837432
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	6.064711406445819
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	5.637262471127443
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	8.681920018434115
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	8.372017821758702
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	7.276526388872507
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	6.571606030554125
Everything has become more and more complex.	7.363002036496796
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	8.170152623420373
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	5.513314175706419
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	6.345516011806648
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	10.848094412925377
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	7.158250678351793
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	9.423795499830144
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	7.417076335825694
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	9.132877045645495
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	4.9496049522127175
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	6.912960367779227
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	5.951143899933061
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	9.351848301284662
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	6.734820996944499
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	7.189402250678584
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	6.506844551339449
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	8.92789460750721
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	7.641313860731577
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	8.226163178518041
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	7.166937941758913
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	7.639139299806114
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	8.435807147114776
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	6.569571749482752
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	8.166454800744182
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	7.00070648841036
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	7.592367653265346
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	7.1879786388260625
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	8.942645920362581
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	8.345856929493277
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	5.313404846693666
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	7.259712858814859
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	8.633557860034143
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	8.536073312926243
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	7.932609730455859
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	7.079024676473345
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	11.715934438801979
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	8.36092102416396
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	7.108314178331706
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	6.048747686222535
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	10.931860166722869
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	8.097159329817268
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	6.809030046879124
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	9.135197642687007
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	9.2057634476145
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	6.410394375005625
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	9.911441064087992
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	2.555057810258517
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	7.005115202676078
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)	2.4375052047030645
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	5.8035149568047375
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	7.5577581644594325
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	6.123025993087668
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	7.70780073259744
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	5.8122190491181875
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	7.363822681199976
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	7.994527231411123
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	7.583769567535303
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	7.317730138576935
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	5.80353577485815
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	8.297958399331796
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	6.851328472559546
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	6.897761956007714
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	7.168481807300345
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	7.374152113211545
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	5.56447011881784
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	6.651483331848181
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	1.9724305040648895
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	4.479209345700735
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	9.56732599364743
I condemn J√∂rg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	6.163327425769924
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	9.021112356462664
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	8.227879465503392
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	8.25876546883923
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	7.945292944277283
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	4.802316875767305
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	5.89450673588711
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	6.511811894274256
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	7.526368251633951
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	7.18458735987947
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	7.1144510661602975
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	8.373579224920457
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	7.7982127851759415
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	8.210401748584603
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	8.097939973689542
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvri√®re Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	8.551303282047035
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	10.138256742325616
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	7.573991969121784
The same applies to labour market policy.	6.504069042121033
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	6.323714822159543
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	7.365749520738906
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	5.009033089166483
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	6.723821604741356
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	3.544122754179864
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	7.808385484479267
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	5.184527353667573
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	7.836837498143084
It lasted only five months.	5.753847601365994
weighting of votes in the Council	1.3669196317713483
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)).	3.4421237100962485
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	7.605083244230582
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	6.232030138281966
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	9.33580466136454
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	5.606509360448169
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	8.705802032124463
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	6.07531983783224
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	8.457655085124568
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	5.629546037697147
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	7.086174118313108
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	7.882666394129572
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	5.727322210076535
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	12.164670729880047
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	6.363167875967253
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	7.055144451311482
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	9.544253201717742
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	10.259528799528045
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	10.695191261083105
Goebbels (PSE).	4.726301583179451
This issue is extremely serious.	5.131733657804744
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	7.076578940846452
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	10.407891643399159
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	6.3567550653339335
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	8.496870910794694
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	6.665083296853731
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	9.553516721097868
He is a driven man, a competent man.	6.560069159596821
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	7.462518717366777
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	7.563886022467573
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	6.549481857530326
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	8.513445398213406
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	8.501200715993397
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	6.340159015151175
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	7.3985583044912095
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	8.070787435486313
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	7.054188702475565
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	7.248280982846874
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	6.553566748253688
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	7.14905286193326
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	5.056952025348166
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	6.718090680023369
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	6.011651090973332
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	7.286459675347813
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	5.972502201449156
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	6.23147231521264
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	7.678532323158402
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	8.018169388281066
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	8.13123159887742
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	6.990230754665309
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	6.457051447022358
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el¬≠-Sheikh agreements.	7.717860098640479
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	6.172862179523594
As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	7.260457994922979
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	8.819511048572682
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	7.676075446257831
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	6.432981312365729
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	3.2344521252038616
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	7.536717727827753
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	7.218482264052668
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	10.437819445694906
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	8.935056670522926
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	9.476229710706694
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	8.249578617284584
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	7.66416987146356
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	8.723072507612434
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	5.460572966957141
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	8.011881522840548
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	10.103197307045196
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	2.6092425746779786
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	7.155174033791845
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	6.9830117573488595
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	5.803177690123317
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	12.814636996371528
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	5.151923059404995
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	7.661778053490571
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	6.166695273810629
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	6.683637440519487
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	7.125674281342008
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	7.941706264238576
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	8.767632803389084
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	8.14878993857301
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	7.916197991627526
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	8.431306118811056
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	6.270866233075984
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	6.50198865619819
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
Unfortunately, very little.	6.258385288793654
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	9.627798713696349
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	6.136774526511477
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	6.580875064140038
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	6.814622272462563
That is absolutely absurd.	3.613832263538462
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	6.775226401100752
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	7.832163419122453
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	4.948180936043049
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	6.778177461404774
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	7.8397618382332785
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	6.583323939902303
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	7.35954578177774
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	7.177472646774641
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	9.449799905627994
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	6.812983288804635
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	7.756424288209552
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	6.661186449935265
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	9.181342784727146
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	7.02486118652464
It is therefore political by nature.	12.62091613787501
Whatever J√∂rg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	9.014781207962166
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	6.916110582079532
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	6.191630016104493
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	8.313376053789733
These will take place at a later date.	4.43617573462769
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	7.251582521284756
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	7.482081752000734
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	6.626084612813809
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	8.110484873193606
The previous speaker already said something about this.	8.708353282333409
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	9.373671959683666
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	7.765396098796371
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	10.29548189199404
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	8.221537994321455
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	8.146949284993847
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	7.705651679198238
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	7.742803453234981
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	8.0210016334193
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	7.480597388387518
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	9.6849771853852
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	10.913624435346188
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	6.739247505888253
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	6.506197295358484
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	5.926452283524472
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	5.178096919845098
We should be careful about this.	8.405599770795956
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	5.314570940071637
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	8.72400163874182
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	7.97117878611655
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	9.423299411389745
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	6.912399005110979
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	7.325687806948616
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	8.405552623682691
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	7.366597452206211
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	6.733129661360828
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	7.7632386164105345
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	7.281635568595355
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	8.553413046623358
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	8.486898172837137
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	10.269089095717696
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	6.97798066146805
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	8.743656224050236
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	5.7983296332637755
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	6.380877840476892
. I accept that.	12.425942286955008
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	6.354957935954088
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	6.109626206788302
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	5.771861001770808
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	8.937203314266892
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	7.081665122316388
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	6.824826418130242
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	7.673008734237154
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	6.3284573338624375
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	7.615589363114784
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	8.299233778771896
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	7.719719437327745
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	6.7507295848234055
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	7.258685831888403
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	8.165854327954747
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	5.840215435151295
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	7.733916435304107
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	5.294281846317784
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	7.7311734981215805
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	6.355169823742798
We have to get this right.	13.681490063495886
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)).	2.9704746676856746
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	6.0263582658663575
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	7.6117909488052256
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	6.129045146249133
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	6.738059077042279
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	5.4834603148935965
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lom√© Convention Accord.	7.496450140913787
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	6.350408181790626
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	4.492412269550697
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	5.846909348189387
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	8.073537552186663
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	7.5665261024704815
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	7.2285401331021975
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	7.078466753033096
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	6.356195550523362
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	7.111850307821875
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	6.848797079868556
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	8.605646057183868
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	6.368358397651858
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	5.600850857841416
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	8.445949570904228
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	7.098429168044566
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	8.084473493800111
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	7.813490688787519
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.	6.3820833999269615
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	8.13003404115581
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	7.053179833941718
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	6.309580961112726
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	6.85449900089423
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	7.455783121860278
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	8.617449132921664
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	5.792100221350596
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	7.990310310498613
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	10.545583189716725
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	6.302918592082273
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	7.047095028910989
When will we debate that?	9.473033323219829
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	13.06330521191467
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	7.495341591232408
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	6.0630283517758725
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55¬∫C or 60¬∫C in the sun.	8.69071526315865
Only, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	7.296519860250851
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	7.688947981939514
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	6.984279712584814
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	6.393284918542085
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almer√≠a and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almer√≠a having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	7.2889336128477025
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	8.054821966744923
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	9.456220574130256
In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	6.383139095727421
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	6.886482313822558
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	7.450085488999308
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	7.6556770789488295
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	6.046279644553362
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	7.059765127057238
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	6.879347269296692
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	7.974065702590561
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	7.132910726211163
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	7.719968473924739
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	11.831342781014738
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	5.981602492562676
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	14.06509035316751
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	6.540718112735247
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	7.03149887181014
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	7.457924314987528
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	7.004297624127661
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).	3.9029985498348783
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	8.004994584953742
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	6.7111514087277255
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	7.030872341858981
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	5.548821949805981
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	7.39573024447212
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	7.3340947327858865
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the J√∫car, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the J√∫car and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	7.214476246541929
Most of the report is about financial control.	18.376326963791705
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	6.658471841684589
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	6.915458041128877
Report (A5-0012/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established within the Community (COM(99)0003 - C5-0050/2000 - 1999/0013(CNS))	2.3028992669160626
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	8.125546975662164
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	7.172223180668608
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	5.529888933152852
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	7.40232785460703
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr D√©sir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	4.260190175598376
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	11.80103250018189
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	7.150161947261718
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	6.309116475856595
They will need time to get used to that too.	6.1599512098990825
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	7.821151694014606
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	7.072964399704309
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	8.377219415979289
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	6.873837909875386
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	7.236152500265034
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	7.283115658891424
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	10.01812138444048
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	6.885990272992261
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	8.586329502789997
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	7.857424831336315
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20¬∫C. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	7.485196624249557
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	6.690131644762587
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	10.996844962364435
(Loud applause)	1.0785651321630196
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	6.920191501768231
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	4.398940749031814
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	7.943117543975977
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	5.457416617764604
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	8.395044956496076
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	10.359256576508901
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	6.82679470058657
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	6.3760377337563074
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	6.515299795157659
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	5.303997545778162
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	8.145032925107676
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	9.074827337662104
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	8.223160671750197
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	7.558383541268553
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.	8.676051150719614
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	4.6978575981580875
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	7.169977810681072
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	6.644974516374341
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	7.188357904482636
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	8.946963610389249
The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	7.067903535352982
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	6.173718651089755
However, I would just like to add the following.	6.984358966603326
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	7.435973050253923
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	7.5530897993105475
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	6.223524914086549
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	5.051178269145223
That concludes the vote.	4.344987224528784
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	8.339579439823888
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	5.0943133948416035
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	7.083022703266778
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	10.20793986544056
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	9.959139981881961
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	6.694862865988618
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	6.374400952336947
That statement could not be much clearer.	8.22336697944995
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	6.480750834934467
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	5.616707485744632
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	5.2585593345751205
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	6.245236227965974
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	7.777396463483477
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	4.853172349454547
Resumption of the sitting	59.510533629471404
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	7.074780765007489
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	9.498480958528258
Thank you for your statement.	2.6875910166863535
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	8.784669096588097
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	5.445634774181545
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	7.206455387384937
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.	8.100939512797853
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	2.0232282846774647
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	6.298958618013432
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	6.633792378837798
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	5.136389990204542
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	4.190015148993348
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	15.710251475550713
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	5.44100994717915
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	7.134569088003883
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	8.372939869248265
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	6.9285835620411325
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	8.498640855964407
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	8.588149434500627
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	6.172062813793702
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	5.126997038393765
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	6.756040920591599
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	5.163279706772664
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	7.837113886729501
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	7.467208448000239
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	9.830553785973423
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	7.526510625247119
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	7.4645320194200755
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	6.742206214179322
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	2.858007888838381
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	5.640832634884146
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	8.557378719991657
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	6.63329214220279
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	7.4869248951065615
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	8.338882496199162
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	11.11003266554699
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	5.161985025673586
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	5.602570995600118
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	8.04805545297565
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	7.174113081239208
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	7.012034745184507
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	7.988877107512256
And how should we achieve this?	6.823046366333628
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	8.011487063176205
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	7.596192640468663
It is as simple as that.	7.839543553206476
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	7.799625085147706
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	7.294225996906787
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	5.975043815542175
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	7.526058469003525
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	13.390439603797166
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	9.874742020821301
The public must have a right to clean water.	6.905585459056341
The next item is the order of business.	3.5818341879231768
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	7.34833451754614
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	6.147528186435831
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	4.259265417320537
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	5.70148788085172
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	8.971003961514354
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	7.538580417392251
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	4.112171297953013
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	6.984033664620561
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	8.077721046491757
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	6.806509701786433
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health.	7.0709352520096935
That is our duty.	8.595453020210808
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	7.689075799441053
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	7.4727180561636715
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	7.046859685683901
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	4.210584849823822
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.644126483541
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	9.219766005635007
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	4.589050824026911
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	6.891243495323397
We are not doing a bad job of management.	10.694088450521507
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	5.387202267779604
The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	5.732512980612552
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	7.735823018737438
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	7.589229631220284
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	10.318897837838469
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	5.926573443354437
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	6.23629214649977
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	8.016467751847843
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	8.21420783444311
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	5.223758413612768
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	9.601142796682403
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	14.23500681347395
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	7.144043996107245
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	6.8903445798705
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	4.810151172548132
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	7.960252393557622
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	8.432412335500498
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	6.978313613518944
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	4.354228950576011
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	7.681017064813204
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	7.302940624930722
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	6.897907879416451
This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments.	9.314363662978824
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	8.27815677743085
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	10.582851236504501
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	9.161098405440255
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	6.146388417865736
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	7.710753966975901
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	7.546970199441412
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	6.390766225018642
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	6.3221176019970615
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	9.916041220552067
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	7.2375971764465845
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	5.9206589130539635
With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	8.186197867716906
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	5.602794567112864
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	9.459154588293504
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Gra√ßa Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	6.103509398273483
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	4.962453816927768
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	6.535857330603152
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	8.166345928708262
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	5.824249030549904
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.859468634685895
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	8.088925048648747
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	8.231048510387637
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	7.17314428345682
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	7.027665426472427
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	7.769204081631169
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	9.454004746761218
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	6.920874636424209
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	7.211803791813424
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	6.387351586613916
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	7.405847573875028
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	5.99806645714546
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	8.150783869428684
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	6.78264989735876
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	12.448339361132666
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	6.769903864490447
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	7.900521365897667
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	9.041765860685983
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	8.041337095055416
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	11.877382259990956
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public.	6.766262048371677
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	8.232953722904591
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	5.915191760904104
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	9.789860930153782
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	6.1434984657188325
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	8.078346264496274
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	8.565362829446535
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	7.57875164375598
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	7.684746397908792
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.	6.82769932913024
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	6.2243212919445305
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	7.736322283315614
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	8.402394468407392
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	9.153199576914513
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	2.3805738998746033
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	5.478948496435565
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	7.392099862452769
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	6.223262293542985
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lom√©, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	8.144275328695668
That is why he deserves special mention!	16.39353248132954
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	9.476112957239176
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	7.901749700919267
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	9.23737416221177
What has become of it?	6.895077248764572
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	6.733746825630376
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	8.013947424730407
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	8.583090285227089
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	7.284954205687708
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	7.338734591953511
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	7.185009379083479
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	5.994612016336722
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	9.531560759718722
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	6.078391766550822
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	7.416276281346107
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	6.791676331643842
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	7.410121739851407
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	7.828012257587852
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	7.295128174907445
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	10.935700055570312
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	7.146675192588502
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	6.121473751820368
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	9.289952846346312
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	7.243505593842237
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	7.397581384090741
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	9.013716775346214
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	7.687722555052329
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SP√ñ?	6.721598124774421
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	7.898042964314522
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	6.928082818361553
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	8.535670878025988
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	7.396969846653477
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	9.164237453293328
China likes doublespeak.	3.842630276147243
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	8.611738832805553
As Commissioner Wallstr√∂m indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	7.827928161067604
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	7.297115562578053
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	4.089987722081199
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	8.716554896467834
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	6.765601839779397
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	5.235246580707498
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	7.7778129081603185
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	7.94080089230884
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	9.014541517953349
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	8.974008864430642
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	7.497053115848195
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	7.896842094721275
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	6.564867438894428
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	8.46566459445739
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	5.740536182014912
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	7.338628832815076
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	6.440548491400685
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	6.1790975498279
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	8.230189220595731
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	7.536556740736404
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	6.823193947865341
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	5.8720812706921155
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	6.9572282270270005
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	7.148851806943315
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	9.829869483531525
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	5.028815187183217
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	7.252976983039297
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	6.31252099644334
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	6.251647887807291
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	8.001518338085502
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	9.991689420550586
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	6.91685612681962
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	7.885811394902003
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	3.13423679988643
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	7.743356546192329
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	5.208426866073857
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	9.63929681813167
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	7.09521036049724
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	6.998407772207887
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	6.482312539159003
It is good that the procedure exists.	5.317625565409349
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	7.104328619183163
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	9.941621102978571
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	8.90175152221629
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	6.22714255974284
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	8.346494526875716
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	7.323913022355303
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	8.900298244483707
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	6.3024239290748865
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	6.7822880422178065
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	10.484473674012841
He has talked extensively about the new Lom√© Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting.	7.585065600643185
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	9.795119719763854
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	7.99674984748942
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	7.969931684686909
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	9.615267297628384
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	6.957820297409931
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	6.127250352195475
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	7.102244383561656
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	3.300127182026085
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	8.879494287701458
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	8.756840462124208
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	7.897352707945116
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.563489818211283
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	7.039511332380068
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	8.454318620894343
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	9.643905765006492
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	6.767600940370718
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	6.541855247090054
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	4.980452731407416
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	8.302262279472107
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	6.894850521851538
The Commission must listen to it.	12.719813847715956
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	6.360068789819511
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	7.063316554755102
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	8.207778138197117
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	6.548350015222118
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	6.404764795424207
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	5.456090310798815
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	6.480502464373094
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	6.481616055319601
B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	4.080651186967193
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	7.362496064385171
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	9.305888196202577
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	7.174334611008091
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika d√©marche on the eleventh of this month.	6.9684048625276915
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	5.94972495027877
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	10.50820264983201
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	7.57962346945262
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	6.402836219086263
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	6.951464424037318
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	5.703864817030835
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	5.758850958879524
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	8.028009185369378
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	8.032641848327954
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	7.896962019679882
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	7.63349282581327
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	6.026171741632743
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	8.311607917791218
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	8.200545213801341
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	8.776440398238117
It could have sunk anywhere.	6.993416899246537
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	10.120855238137938
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	7.655779573424025
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	7.133803413020281
Is this simply a political gesture?	6.041880351319046
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	5.7542596238918
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	6.863963780451908
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	9.294589558982803
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	6.663653440185095
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	9.628131048866456
The last question concerns the amount granted.	7.365846985787234
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	7.473591134713695
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	6.946960400426149
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	8.160761380325901
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	7.204254189346452
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vend√©e, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	7.510245586146715
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	7.049278224653633
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Bar√≥n Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	7.142242952480797
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	6.689280355620145
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	4.074072447986696
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	6.827607812387698
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	6.988653313350278
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	5.776012749488942
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	5.376103275224451
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	6.8824959533475525
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	9.36058419121771
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	7.885094069615499
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	7.81733512447424
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	9.273421721126685
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	7.7012582779165335
Action is not limited to legislation.	6.533543448697632
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	7.9456610334135
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	8.318804365406667
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	7.154322447990739
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	6.711447278431159
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	8.54473616802914
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	7.543821225758285
How many people found work?	9.67055701194472
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	5.4242245939115215
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lom√© Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	6.134140496518295
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	6.796352971242373
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	12.005235279621273
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	8.908836774045165
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	7.051977406929346
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	4.578214150828711
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	7.13332507011264
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	10.818273652511085
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	10.69707139494508
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	8.16558719377446
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	8.828467268195801
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	7.052673055743248
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	15.316800718839298
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	6.677738614769696
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	9.967529080332831
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	8.419301526791163
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	8.945287537123605
That is also mentioned in the report.	5.451163566786245
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	5.393043803928372
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the √ñVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	6.376698740781577
It was very small.	4.819431601269729
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	7.366457964329943
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	3.5791806575169076
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	6.235699512737411
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	7.224679524135694
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	7.306981977668527
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	10.248285448608359
They are already having implications for resource availability.	6.474801869034494
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	7.279406801992244
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	6.3366134043686975
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	7.216353107096739
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	5.345994698003685
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	9.486307123289809
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	7.100204517078257
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	6.997740772789566
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	5.594189959172205
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	7.991943338791035
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	6.6514423434298875
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	5.681185960804812
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	6.2419960611912355
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	4.596782202161313
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	8.139059565728724
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	4.3923638418874775
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	9.493562088009886
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	5.351688621362575
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	7.367258363187283
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	5.945229008196813
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	6.926428983911694
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	6.5026839200076605
Thank you for listening.	30.385402324924783
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	6.499215187919254
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	6.664633608713947
Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread.	6.088925716797492
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	8.788752429807772
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	3.981095725627035
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	5.826068478225351
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	5.931763172261569
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures.	7.705326322310515
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	6.953721305656851
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	6.3836519453673874
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	7.44100052125274
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	8.865559133850512
We are now unable to guide the peace.	11.594165869804243
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	7.694340171592606
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are, in turn, generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious.	6.951272789132195
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	5.938091107593397
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	7.654020832388246
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	6.779645645219002
Parliament has no equivalent power.	5.672302344700655
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	8.457829725888741
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	9.304770665969954
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	7.514742313797569
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	9.11491198587736
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	6.477481687910683
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	7.017910039353822
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	8.591118020930375
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	7.14027757134272
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	6.218397943419664
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	6.874450768120049
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	7.6720101157001785
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	4.435564324773776
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	11.45282628374027
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	4.781197301254205
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	8.064855013545944
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	8.596494100067233
Can you please do something about it?	5.289728524520578
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	6.958939571005678
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	8.22882092619366
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	7.229544839292045
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	5.991033030974126
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	7.2222191190213545
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	7.701565002267667
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	7.063734897922925
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	8.174927128764601
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	6.208132059593303
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	6.898416140773023
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	10.025328840305242
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	7.110524949481364
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	7.44233509104706
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	9.027669156460203
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	9.318735964486912
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	7.287684501847408
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	8.593366703625792
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	6.854944499265583
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	10.080015290834163
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	6.984835237057022
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	7.042925947634472
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	8.42300027242883
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	8.110017509901148
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	8.018647970061531
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	7.474034841406147
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	8.594088384639779
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	8.200578173594726
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	8.470967523427552
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	9.96595513220685
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	6.232674758323999
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	3.761472969928477
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	6.236537124424352
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	7.816655355515474
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	6.7791640968338704
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	7.3421956610155075
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	5.653025634251755
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	5.544340599623714
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	8.398759549782234
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	9.188680704142582
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	14.120077033317243
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	7.7675743460281375
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	9.16712921403048
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	6.583009778359949
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	8.714565393326442
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	7.124131635777083
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	7.715230053440049
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	7.553851327877606
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	7.915810347583836
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	8.007470971435058
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	7.907419214090474
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	8.823269088367606
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	7.588229234575432
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	8.317601768034109
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	5.466739100259884
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	7.592618408105995
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	6.774902924278404
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	8.175141245481804
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	8.663585880211583
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	3.489871855991743
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	6.653810027389875
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	7.003310127743996
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	8.594316584563737
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	7.7383408451211455
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	4.763121774357075
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	5.185871771372193
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	7.138445464800055
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	8.397146817047004
With regard to the C√¥te d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	9.796298433823559
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	7.773566325896851
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	8.092053924351587
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	6.541818817633103
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	5.59780265730114
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	8.65601692416863
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	9.10275360212583
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	7.969427171460021
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	8.156164205790121
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	6.556306758284774
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	11.003197040286672
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	8.862671412069343
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	10.935790096325027
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	4.115921633932099
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	4.691212340909351
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	8.333176340644588
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	6.4766977361106175
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	6.975067865802923
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	8.463330915107665
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	7.220831683309212
There are two approaches.	16.76914443579424
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	11.934013576098378
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	10.879993641466736
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	7.379556322683533
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	8.451324448805368
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	11.063788030667396
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	9.075266654485455
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	7.85554149733346
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	9.670308533097252
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	6.766714010326263
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	7.3778519727591085
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	6.186083136504134
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	5.724720475960789
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	7.875647073887147
But where will you place the emphasis?	7.053373546447818
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.972487966703713
I would quote Gaza as an example.	5.1609706560177475
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	8.690342826537465
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	7.118516968116534
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	6.924351104761422
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	8.002272418057549
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	9.278870711853171
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	7.68645379639882
WIPO treaty	46.285069293388226
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	5.501118719879615
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	6.428752909573041
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	5.70861459904527
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	8.580145367479433
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	6.535348644791379
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	10.93230235501257
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	5.871407001418972
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	7.217856987250022
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	8.346097781473633
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	8.430031779215753
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	10.142021964213251
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	5.818032970202103
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	6.678014148269542
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	7.696856544599445
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	7.25247616919159
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	5.830004896576023
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	8.820740127159587
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	9.300985242815887
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	8.067566907285682
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	7.246605643828379
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105.	6.242323034725921
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	6.65638746351985
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	5.542834808682494
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	5.3888037752913505
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	8.620511875453246
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	7.145352778806994
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	7.234562768921923
This is why I give this report my full support.	9.109400169916393
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	8.095199598931506
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	7.742214411020629
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	7.267633077654818
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	6.952286217440996
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	6.156019170622515
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	5.470018403207183
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	9.837903011544178
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	6.648224957214607
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	9.152072365111803
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	5.348993424915995
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	5.533633448448195
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	7.0781160747154015
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	10.657291579161562
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	4.505562013119617
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	8.766598575527226
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	6.7564650380607265
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	8.214747283880984
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	7.060710555629206
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	5.042022351670794
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	9.369107224923958
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	8.469541497043634
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	8.422767646812233
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	8.236320386722262
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	7.105277124725093
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	5.528913761290181
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	7.658105648942958
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	8.501605361163657
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	5.882546540721208
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	8.59412208163562
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	10.02396766353307
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	6.264171201393645
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	6.886791270403964
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	6.552163319848948
This is wrong!	8.620585576859927
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	6.770095811735065
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	7.617451805243866
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	7.467999621569377
They are still in training, as it were.	9.03676415807224
It is still the old imperial service.	8.187350822659479
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	2.1187063205840597
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	4.043288526911905
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	6.5159521126427
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	7.0691078335426125
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	6.163377152676699
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	7.547821525540353
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	6.5114358617018055
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	7.167261079879752
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	8.009368349339333
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	6.645498812780595
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	8.675011501045633
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	7.971767220890553
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	9.642250859691496
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	7.1144977007954875
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	7.253880016016602
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	9.832131832963988
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	4.072691045363281
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	8.730375795909127
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	4.62493277924027
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	6.489503061334261
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	10.518954153415057
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	7.729684197135498
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	7.182916450242663
But we must support our tourism!	18.13282332125819
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	7.910365355217676
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	11.225540810015483
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	7.266600819970171
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	5.6769526670388695
I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	5.279336187727847
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	6.726269735586829
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	10.399821151998493
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	12.052457723755264
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	8.97201645502532
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	6.332148066595239
Cross-border services	46.285069293388226
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	7.4387798588269956
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	6.73852680469937
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	8.58160073898048
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	8.291625506307303
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	6.416447099278997
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	7.046490042068798
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	8.120447853132077
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	7.279865469745276
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	7.219531548782376
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	7.276999565014067
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3165503112335124
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	6.665732702997111
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	7.079976711763307
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	8.676700182676306
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	14.159664715350711
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	7.249140175128863
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	6.671130119153921
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	10.060329129612713
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	5.89381714458559
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	6.854259727255316
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	6.9903847060432165
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	7.564575026158669
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	7.895163991045714
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	6.699548157004103
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	7.229321895595336
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	7.141517618651294
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	7.014946629264015
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	7.897388883294693
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	8.3296834127841
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	8.66910719909843
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	7.2622968189244395
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	8.05060310940765
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	10.628158967070137
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	8.233439729639555
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	9.436410226032127
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	8.907397413973543
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	6.875273203172056
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	9.89635374353235
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	7.530427332958514
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	7.594747143475277
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	7.61417030936267
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	7.794705808104993
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	8.376274288620586
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	4.373687709013472
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	6.371581118201219
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschi√∂ld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	4.890682382660349
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	8.876162040962814
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	6.861306096014782
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	8.201203122163442
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	6.776558685894835
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	6.708079324252534
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	6.475034320899835
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	8.500109973756986
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmstr√∂m put it.	9.366396311495356
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	8.331853594163293
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	5.916460308173684
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	8.473793687759684
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	7.336954992272669
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	10.127254745070033
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended))	3.7661751936207395
What is the result?	78.27084411967869
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.5900261655542136
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	7.230223810414544
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	7.851117444598979
We have to be aware of this.	7.079051359259606
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	8.615708798456126
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water.	6.452265976463351
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	9.64881512460385
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	5.625422694560035
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	6.246634123405479
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	5.829845289636178
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	6.802982443824281
But there is an art to that as well.	8.872934273988944
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	8.228869339411624
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	6.072635070900984
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	7.3864885363928305
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	8.33228423647796
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	6.1965595269438145
Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	7.080838959230903
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	6.952981992410109
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	7.386751703106775
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	9.952333893622296
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	12.55461734466641
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	5.694928108793066
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	7.127942888756645
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	6.398675897094381
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	6.082205605807618
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	7.087206816161771
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	7.412673024593594
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqu√©s and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	7.3108970181421435
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	6.5445386476519145
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	8.982158978877345
We are to get the agendas.	8.115350381290595
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	8.198599643259136
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	7.293670709139334
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.	11.726252836608158
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	7.778414405341835
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	5.099265402670411
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	9.534674240097043
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	5.1886080488366515
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	6.691960745515098
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	8.667771098146469
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	6.061670621897319
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	7.998420790907608
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....	8.018548712069805
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	7.1901632602810785
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	6.00204327875442
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	9.23301259025381
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	8.968218832296863
I would ask you once again to work on this.	8.353932619509123
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	10.262710050182372
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	6.607608673958631
Because they have fewer opportunities.	11.750128494972884
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	5.4175578987824
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	8.172239108134598
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	7.157669064099259
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	6.0751528918997195
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	6.208519372451387
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	6.815365782992106
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	7.907086936576942
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	5.475816505724357
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	7.711969293324533
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	8.072923178024674
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	8.151378385177006
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	9.225108519829046
This is my main concern in this matter.	7.557606780917761
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	6.727315765952949
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	5.644641819673543
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	1.7953177119572696
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	7.4649564166600575
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	9.088156727295267
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	6.778633676521557
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	7.764469711914245
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	6.2711607013966715
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	6.920395122408394
SAVE	14.22659668727896
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	6.325105343166213
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	6.46457148197765
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	7.857046738776472
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	5.639163402512443
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	7.926788813189265
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	8.745239570655054
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	6.315919273696002
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	5.363332245613523
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	6.844389690151179
That is my judgement at the moment.	7.7450459211225695
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	5.916227812520442
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	5.911998228181845
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	7.276484494470426
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	7.642364092115345
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	8.321479204480642
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	9.168880833309021
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	8.064721926350497
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	5.961371444678378
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	7.837633238243668
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	2.371039465563392
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	9.210821480651784
Relating to Friday: President.	6.200144637665119
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	8.018778518532113
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	6.320602420128847
You can see it in different countries.	7.550292601450927
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	6.296392916659602
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	6.043517755396322
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	9.760656552213419
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	6.810849683581008
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	8.236129587089467
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	8.018105354041852
The human rights policy is also too selective.	7.382125486967902
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	2.8308740160293033
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	7.129437153729357
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	7.4230230769388585
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	5.41897643422785
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	6.232858768891877
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	9.070448781385194
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	7.156906022172093
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	7.3714695517662685
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	9.799255133145765
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	6.331615413057792
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	6.733470217097816
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	7.86745851125047
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	5.072092547034881
(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.8524544248434147
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	8.183317256529515
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	6.852106083982108
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	5.848352115370653
Resumption of the session	1.9337498405317024
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	9.383231527040287
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	10.26772235403704
All this is important.	16.204875491410014
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	6.462493939640367
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	8.298655588416622
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	6.776807159954836
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	5.7942663107721915
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	8.013468504688067
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	7.394556012392241
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lom√© Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	8.369495378002062
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	8.191229955633322
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	6.953757673553849
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	7.324444459355176
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	3.8345901097711725
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	8.477286814143316
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	6.251832034469439
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	7.758818470360776
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	6.616061090537438
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	8.56410818760359
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	8.238368992309166
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	3.599673137279631
Change in the law is fundamental.	9.187806566074602
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	9.098456646248215
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	5.019456212084247
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	7.7336094614526365
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	7.758451775356163
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	9.63276343958129
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	7.465791432742364
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	7.08846092824783
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	11.627624704233686
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	6.09378153032277
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	5.678969324709443
We have achieved a compromise solution.	6.5240833091223625
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	6.22772775366038
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	7.141546542438396
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	5.453286312642954
It is now February and we are still waiting.	15.77156965872957
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	7.645218251936104
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	11.440657529589949
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	9.009628826063386
That is important.	4.450204297502966
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	7.768138134026511
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	7.577461813010787
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	5.485025711621559
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	6.592866860603388
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	6.469001741691869
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	8.490907051594396
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance.	7.773331303555222
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	5.234436396192273
I also stressed the need for prevention.	7.909793648004303
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	6.978886830551112
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	6.696473624064252
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	5.997484606390151
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	6.860394964257806
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	7.033668845730291
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	6.723429334266538
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	8.964517457932523
There is nothing new in your work programme.	7.2375865703686415
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	11.046197678068248
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	9.525921816768824
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	6.754684279603628
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	8.15289245945766
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	6.481093622314345
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	2.1479139555482805
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	6.65698770654524
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	6.844451951160569
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	10.29718913639521
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	7.506620966258459
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	6.830920868947127
Company restructuring in Europe	1.24871351211862
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	8.028363577660176
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	6.885169361387661
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	7.486043982562695
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	7.221369174865466
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	2.464176177225971
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	6.335206852575086
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	7.953524450968538
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	7.184589832840393
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	8.39522070540947
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	8.229479846982466
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	6.4596931957096295
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	6.007383625877025
Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology' (1999/468/EC)	3.3840454978470307
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	7.293234539824816
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	7.579628729411655
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	6.660831946493219
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	6.309858881948394
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	8.747533944552606
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	8.582695110256628
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	7.788541498904463
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	10.142546866401553
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	6.174829357348876
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	5.246352134935597
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	9.366841372561558
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	7.979979133996307
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	5.54866313738898
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	9.357140185707694
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	8.303711982765009
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	7.751376138857071
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	9.861830056128104
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	8.046752715703441
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	8.548567947781995
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	7.616405906635059
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	2.600293401861889
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	8.199045345731193
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely.	8.470033978145315
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	6.65404886427782
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	5.071038407186201
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	7.429184724434344
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	7.6374987881593315
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	6.514338105825913
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	8.102834679451595
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	7.279352883935046
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)	5.103031546125087
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	8.317264527705005
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	8.45886750041882
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	9.711650276744082
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	6.904533265109364
The EU' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention, which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment.	9.813070365480984
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	2.987134954217565
However, I find these passports inadequate.	16.865913205899012
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	10.612821592593034
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	7.729961648257575
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	6.375235411883019
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	9.842322013143582
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	5.20076432125724
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	9.147608314083707
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	8.160168423076001
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	6.164994845521723
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	8.965994992334835
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	9.385739647363964
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	9.88104846713492
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	7.584036775422705
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	8.497043464914164
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	7.141613912905324
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	8.473847618086099
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	7.86964164396182
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	8.41269183751225
The Commission' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	8.173181194347382
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	8.771849798136625
So the "Grappa War" is over.	14.098732252968677
We are all immigrants.	12.666345785525776
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	2.3256418713299287
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	7.496439091756859
Report (A5-0007/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)0003 - C5-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD))	2.1065923258886685
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	4.402249730956437
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	8.203063758667012
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	7.071343564241525
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	10.312025086177975
These proposals favour women especially.	4.6509767730858185
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	7.8322493581761865
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	8.761406838855017
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	8.744420366337248
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	10.788677551978328
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	6.304804243912296
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	7.569292397808967
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	7.407986845594788
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	7.916589423562443
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avil√©s Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	8.305022412796681
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	6.492461625864306
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	7.995875639297986
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	5.067309127081625
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	6.97224655121083
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	8.7144573146484
.	52.89722204958655
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	6.1973147670605995
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	5.619079767438911
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	6.180482313265378
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	9.238704166922581
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	5.209897754198784
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	5.157962979142693
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr D√©sir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	7.94394310170979
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	7.584238984788787
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	7.414467453005799
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	7.9045140710712065
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	8.423244181475855
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	5.405598977956543
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	7.908851093174141
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	2.3885877973894183
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	5.685801213898923
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	8.35616262888924
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	7.951896394796393
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	6.392395422758066
I have a related point.	13.94558885285974
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	7.7398047595511414
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	1.2264779583237335
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	7.834740818396818
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	5.487647671014306
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	6.299421619552395
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	8.044271300265049
I refer to Eurodac.	10.714233268051808
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	5.862335007275859
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	8.615768918985328
Report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	2.391299022117846
We understand the context of this essential debate.	8.030240267505313
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	7.689443337254917
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	7.629411061039749
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	7.175017005161139
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	6.932582464598884
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	6.385560089877247
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	8.450530010881495
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.076338907151673
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	6.286293124115685
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	6.284512598863485
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	6.700680351758693
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	7.760035345889274
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	10.71643011482573
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	11.117339991241549
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	4.932045822124739
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	5.254159811783804
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	6.124570425570082
My vote was "in favour" .	4.843544888740968
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	8.274434506623953
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	6.664758473340482
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	8.913118185576375
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	5.714103917532333
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	8.66276317244799
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	7.2680426986858695
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	8.876810372404188
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	8.513873168427171
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	6.700350593614515
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	7.304611810259125
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	7.829595954635457
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	8.0643320294533
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	8.320138311502472
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	4.638479984536811
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	8.733168804391253
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	7.375208444042071
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	7.4559819746645
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	6.4759084577462005
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	7.450974177881306
I would like to finish off with this observation.	7.041539928438477
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	9.080089204211923
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	7.232231775704169
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	6.03827324833181
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	7.856984349333224
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	6.969657068717166
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	6.7057131623856385
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	11.582696823318301
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	6.9082483579695975
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	8.364746778723681
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	7.567917973991402
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	9.352148264241244
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council' s functions as a legislative body.	8.358568434028133
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	7.17854712444211
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	7.943189889640833
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	9.329444925608914
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	9.269258477861865
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	6.705514924252888
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gas√≤liba i B√∂hm and Mr S√°nchez Garc√≠a, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	2.787532272086449
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	7.748410795156922
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	4.246997448165572
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	3.962233741191163
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	8.953058355265389
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	6.178550660841925
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	7.192674453754491
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	5.901036151418699
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	11.987216549706021
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	6.465236993617286
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.517824480062082
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	8.208027362992162
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	7.092277202813428
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	7.185986945074545
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	7.369905281667597
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	5.040969415526039
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	8.769182927328472
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	1.1438227504289553
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	1.1438227504289553
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	8.468645084153085
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	7.1215521432891435
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	6.811363110554132
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	8.404877802280714
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	6.8116620915442905
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	7.6746673288607745
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	10.231690661457304
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	8.003696477747916
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	6.953487546801099
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	8.034763254280682
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	8.02218449808819
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	7.320982787151045
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	7.744607385367031
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	7.5114652310652685
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	8.972844048135839
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	7.882630188736521
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	7.958866512560377
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	6.942983643582539
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs L√∂√∂w which is extremely important in this context.	10.664109432045151
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	5.723328008235995
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	8.822816788394585
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	8.356740103025425
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	7.615811523709884
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	6.7379803243262
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	8.692268939844194
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	6.92949473545171
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vend√©e, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	6.933178883722602
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	7.5715535724884955
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	6.926794374667169
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	8.367169153365513
As Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	5.358612355201402
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	10.484637534569774
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	8.817138724056976
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	6.651530889937886
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	7.936499154709378
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	6.246723166813072
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	5.280291288868431
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	8.863979029121982
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	6.850113656891729
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	7.439544404900177
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	8.170698938348245
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	6.795889696064827
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	7.478508924678011
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	7.63311302044761
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	7.664722211001755
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	8.895224694001831
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	7.167503595180459
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	6.489693333520033
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	6.622178307668177
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	7.1138527915697924
It will be voting against it.	12.7990714398975
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	6.913134297405283
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	7.380024967456705
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	8.035350868965796
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	9.471657291062652
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	5.6961713319879435
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	12.247170790509294
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	5.666230507252423
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	5.936428302472989
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	6.176428856608665
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	6.777176257463656
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	7.519661444627327
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	6.910171787033781
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	5.562584942878904
.	52.89722204958655
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	6.063980938078431
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	7.157426880959932
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	6.960912715473565
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	7.32883111657212
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	7.379409566870588
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	6.685983803905477
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	6.905780601615685
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	7.129963443996461
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	7.000088926962177
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	6.134610656707127
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	7.210597299978872
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	7.885081674031514
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	6.965542380098765
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	7.03393988789705
He has convinced me of that.	5.469426465431205
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	6.689381315531377
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	9.430599703477137
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	8.220023621349183
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	7.8706815930787775
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	5.965309909646272
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	5.925171197923977
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.711079011656367
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	6.897998509932538
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	8.436390572616673
Bankruptcy procedures	46.285069293388226
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	7.6742292519284305
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	7.711404572427168
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	8.222518031561723
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	4.538740572080738
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	8.76447208359954
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	5.907490035894183
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	8.223972681895107
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	7.615401829604804
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	9.343188505581884
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	9.07491793679575
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	8.095713225268373
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	9.333576247527322
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	7.7545764392537695
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	6.775167658653251
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	7.258874136524174
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	8.93169618259343
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	7.145753110433111
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	5.28563967081655
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	4.587974651737094
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	8.250046824683338
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	6.846692518720078
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	4.197633146017322
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	8.554399335374109
.	52.89722204958655
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	7.392923291524313
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	8.49048803745686
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	7.430246946317767
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	6.086612240229016
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	7.962800425470939
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	8.093773714548911
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	7.196108127629699
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	5.883479359655929
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	5.19978465990232
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	7.149121058869454
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	7.840108821700096
That message must be taken back from here today.	7.917829457005613
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	7.613494909843652
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	7.704136908643622
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	7.915584779950431
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	8.92907616278071
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	6.593014247109458
Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	6.841670335987993
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	5.984115726394268
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	8.773898099903038
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	7.969283043300386
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	8.363522469608183
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	8.27990561148476
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	10.207534064851648
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	7.975514145797135
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	7.400784655636822
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	9.043855800999395
Mr President, I voted for the Decourri√®re report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	7.370989398328872
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	6.776814169315548
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	9.372598530843849
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	6.103754833357941
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	6.323499910643521
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	9.346205725080994
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	7.378540396553873
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	7.841421732062813
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	9.52378317686757
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	8.630819721100595
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	7.0525185235605905
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	6.4041927933181215
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	7.970095996057107
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	7.531327743583908
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	7.670236633938459
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	4.369229869859405
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	7.887399370121783
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	8.815104897545773
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	6.702270714289706
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	6.117091055496305
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	6.970200681049917
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	7.632053224215166
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	8.032996259563586
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	7.410735170337905
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	8.370266579430755
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	6.072236579362839
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	9.844662555905561
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	8.325855156576507
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	7.51844677941719
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	6.87742192101908
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	7.426404174422477
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	7.211970987641021
That concludes Questions to the Council.	2.2676030434178314
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations.	8.815116683086234
But Europe is changing.	8.14941985587404
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	9.22608002197153
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	9.112362689636429
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	7.930794049535983
Questions to Mr Barnier	17.739548412688347
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	7.219228971760851
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	7.174151735745115
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	7.497377013174035
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	6.857297311247559
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	8.026722710414443
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	8.23039057575406
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	8.795376885913436
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	6.490622748078072
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	4.745943246457309
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	5.894035955293953
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	7.458515359948193
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	8.25046404262285
The question is: who prosecutes?	15.241867894559292
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	7.720971643463236
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	7.955463915345353
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	8.028567536739084
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FP√ñ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	6.863503590130421
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	6.58619972309865
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	9.847247889257003
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	6.307192100214322
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	7.088792283249202
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	8.152696108578176
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	6.92743983505755
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	8.901777546047349
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	8.014183742756028
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	1.2264779583237335
It is time for action.	5.962480325670037
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	5.177812194305983
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	6.581263183953085
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	6.4174386506356464
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	8.176656722852679
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	8.223781887617147
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	11.06956469507864
Let us remember what is at stake here.	5.525974652550787
One is subsidiarity.	3.8536467277016806
What could be the cause of this?	10.485025545573697
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	7.311095491601085
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	7.580441284790788
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	9.365835334510507
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	7.933497788785856
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	7.060928344346436
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	5.91337924406103
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	7.844430970956872
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	7.628788219679113
That is how the common position has been worded.	6.883597888952514
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	7.1858444443751
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	7.27561838884166
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	8.287083820512489
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	9.027582469845273
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	6.615325411252969
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	5.8794297305514
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	8.610826934021436
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	8.920749116531113
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	9.774278335618993
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	6.748666890619665
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	9.166128372946329
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	6.968667265144937
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	5.249849610531897
Question Time (Commission)	2.398426374577582
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	9.637133975302538
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	9.228445408049724
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	8.373310403675895
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	5.9253579276445505
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	6.57904733339416
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	8.07230610215847
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	5.922343700384514
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	7.790396226302785
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	8.721296263956992
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	6.673384866020094
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	6.323837865641067
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	9.098169811546894
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	7.7927902572712275
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	4.241996461197871
Reality is obstinate.	3.91636555800595
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	7.068859477479171
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	6.373900887357272
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	15.42557307156195
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	8.41415705937511
That appeared in the communication published last July.	6.833576616613936
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	7.429702953361309
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	7.41664052932237
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	7.658866067079926
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	6.886094120825507
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	7.411224854228587
Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	9.02192266155114
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	8.138772643848634
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	8.529255068539786
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	4.739577861297234
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	7.677582049169293
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	6.127388457428544
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	7.799388760002475
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	8.191060079671026
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	7.75098164178044
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	8.73826694350345
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	6.718183469450832
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	9.91847191049693
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	10.687838374786194
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	6.552374486603255
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	7.551425572503214
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	8.902600529871615
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	6.478234850625959
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	5.714713340983936
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	8.504289968298993
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	16.075135812200866
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	8.828821133082771
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	6.3610700283151465
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	7.56552875488831
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	9.153158594039905
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	9.144740310198966
From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	9.204556121864485
Parliament supports this.	3.0257295548481964
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	7.068867819071978
What are we to do now?	2.401840681551953
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	7.5897540418676925
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	8.485496346272196
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	9.035270120767107
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	7.17150591725767
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	4.420197036222003
And this is not pure chance.	20.744150210199276
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	6.620838072639783
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	7.72853279531685
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	5.430770285659687
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	9.08964778662266
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	7.9446940238519925
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	11.48477389066944
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	5.775693476813368
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	7.8857028845765855
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	9.942304951323303
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	5.201755365394253
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	5.814403602082855
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	7.619755234791891
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	6.919006523215747
The challenge of enlargement is political.	11.37407808464127
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	8.485242959160274
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	5.0465166035706615
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	6.442652209141969
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	6.475800627532854
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	8.634739684369272
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	8.977672665937556
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	9.659386416835169
That has never been the intention.	5.235334772762746
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	6.107864022823582
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	7.186250570597599
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	8.417487826434778
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	7.762742772311093
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	6.653421704038277
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	11.511500849487364
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	9.500993010276478
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	7.3624391723495535
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	6.606763782389186
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	4.8624386463367
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	7.037699475275952
We can take action against this; it is possible.	11.512196621634548
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	4.86699876824242
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	6.090867264783716
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	7.327857267917807
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	8.675277772260463
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	7.218488135005351
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	7.351907651555133
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	7.1360051718688595
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	7.020627548707243
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	5.096756626840796
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	6.232601901023033
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	6.194290198851842
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	9.331815011506356
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	8.87990321388317
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	7.1944206674417845
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	6.04437033607683
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	7.838094040568041
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	8.107496582682034
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	7.483147717049119
Because it is political it is more complex.	5.782851111862248
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	9.50965019926798
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	6.329321037550169
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	7.43730569435326
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	6.095857417908455
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	7.160300495652331
You are most welcome.	5.92104138576535
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	10.200216982411886
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	6.834205582564782
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	8.414898118754145
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	3.1130068373236988
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	5.251109432637433
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	8.779059540057316
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	7.202114269602103
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	7.358823424376463
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	6.729626944270513
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	11.092899970163357
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	8.153421727819955
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	6.279843905366113
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	4.644870533925356
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	10.951631600300407
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	6.306419160453831
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	6.855746282637552
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	5.627474250584476
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	7.850639591171161
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	9.095591368768604
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	8.265044473872639
A key problem is the time factor.	11.239406803197326
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	6.402487677554053
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	6.35257078175095
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	6.7712785378551175
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	6.402392226383406
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	9.463640233925075
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	7.623957885715017
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	8.409641889863954
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	6.269804585178957
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	6.643681656047326
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	9.334647292356296
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	8.580099578898597
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	7.469592408201796
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	6.517599216967329
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	6.404615751876797
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	7.308590402953525
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	6.857385126083925
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	8.253455198738767
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	6.492547327301774
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	10.478097312122918
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	4.682834928486625
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	5.144361972131439
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	9.37904817447235
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	5.6822888499883
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	5.281650618592394
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	7.517094490265529
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	7.08017053733842
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	6.879867296687823
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	6.496399911610785
VOTE	14.22659668727896
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	5.947586367960386
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	8.6918129770761
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	7.712989420687004
It is a miracle that they were saved.	15.933067589721691
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	6.016283150892454
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	7.5958257044833015
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	5.007795520226113
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	5.944933958657397
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	8.132206657862481
So this is what we are going to do.	6.6296729251682285
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	6.621584035443881
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterl√∏n, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	6.603838321897063
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	6.2450708585549695
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria.	7.021777073933445
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	9.361860056392382
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	9.645850710203236
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	6.444462732778141
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	7.945355112442147
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	6.088869895858877
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	4.680659358497711
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	6.500663609277151
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	7.034046175733169
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	6.566458530421187
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	7.559995505152507
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	10.525896989451244
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	6.809184735599232
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	6.428841014753004
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	5.432405391983426
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	7.7201637409244395
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	8.759773716268258
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	6.696524507423957
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	7.8290873540892605
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	9.302594316501892
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	8.055769501259793
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	7.91911153651685
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	4.833086499415734
I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	9.433208346741647
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	9.719811525543367
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	6.299852925777423
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	6.460410346289497
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	6.880942660999667
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	9.768008977078257
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	8.534526434456023
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	6.701560797418048
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	6.120937589023033
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	8.876664241264034
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	6.456657141294513
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	6.449630742625654
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	6.703520249261227
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	5.618353329791753
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	2.4068051597671243
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	6.686338356559582
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	9.461785908234562
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	9.036451064002966
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	8.135838506524665
You are a first class European.	10.29836946342275
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	6.472959159796194
Middle East peace process (continuation)	4.217880789013665
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	7.979875553946965
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.3146471262555792

It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	8.086355437829177
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	7.193414629098
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	7.62970037488999
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	8.848207960816596
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	8.93450796961711
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	7.751114286722558
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	8.09222428013026
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	5.673490266182081
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	7.706035928663848
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	8.814481450543974
This must be regulated during the IGC.	12.997552297091314
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	7.965323342287727
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	7.594804372591175
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	6.390019205210829
Quite the reverse, in fact.	2.659558679069546
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	11.134424217686657
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	6.608290117216323
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	7.079396261597446
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	6.725033991344999
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	11.064557494303488
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	8.445813538527167
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	10.678943243555135
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	4.383959485227116
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	6.5109055538000105
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	6.7956114886564905
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	7.623723930093563
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	8.108947156134864
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	6.513130507946199
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	7.454133192544054
What do they see?	7.19371829071566
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	7.646499719109824
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	6.73275986305712
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	7.240313277519381
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	6.890621656114829
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	6.3254861874696555
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	10.312781840614367
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	6.962049683957239
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	8.031089637249051
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	6.400742785089017
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
Let us make ourselves heard!	7.5917194798378045
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	7.375177110598577
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	6.255218686062773
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	7.8350247477172665
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	10.170869573551455
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	7.856298230108571
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	9.132400192212295
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	5.414639785461909
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	4.844271862015094
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	7.831466451410679
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	8.359781172829708
In yesterday' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	6.578883532156827
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	9.932003435311666
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	6.955601559443373
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	11.57519480245397
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	8.639363982316205
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	8.942521081617837
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	7.382763464863135
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	6.856527499508574
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	6.3473352142897
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	5.648113085882836
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	7.423108364682735
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	7.119269004578665
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	7.7462559007260285
This is all I can say today.	5.9095885097801375
The polluter should pay.	2.9000596931498013
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	7.744274868081557
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	8.499551393373832
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	8.492166043291263
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	6.80353425703374
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	7.658858153733046
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	6.550198153148195
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	2.422653494543481
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	8.520907338877178
Take Sudan.	84.09922128608918
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	6.622222180414667
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	7.748944192328811
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	8.62132354245529
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	5.216564991759866
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	6.483892104832637
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	8.257554542150693
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	9.821335517143902
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	8.262200381773633
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	7.981138384358849
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	6.535025997127882
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	6.475949256700943
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	5.4948398253170065
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	6.440632877334719
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	7.893305876791283
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	6.074919816739581
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	8.775250117333542
We need to get into that conciliation position.	11.685261556171428
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	7.586780809631259
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	7.636637797324624
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	9.139346346028063
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	5.480170553697401
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	6.136648675505613
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	7.075022151948164
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	7.56147103353397
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	11.038354477703793
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	5.414567378393721
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	7.433090630657952
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	8.225248316232205
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	11.855243202391897
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	7.836230318822571
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	8.211332052505446
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	6.715839259920513
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	8.556030074888609
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	7.920844223630179
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	8.460675838430404
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	7.4436356674959345
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	7.1228460842778025
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	8.05224589110015
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	6.308764860154531
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	8.41848963462134
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	7.731372168680697
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	6.521985505704881
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.	7.390536334772997
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	8.850313513678895
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	5.352548263130822
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	5.354027918034479
Vote	14.22659668727896
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	7.243675397953863
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	6.225706140780021
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	7.964689170392219
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	7.593021546099988
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	2.588194588810105
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	6.680507642442158
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	7.561389439852222
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	7.47106273391925
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	11.557407808711003
Do you think I am going over the top?	15.683604278799454
There is a limit to how useful that is.	13.14132914618098
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	6.110807369628135
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	9.317591355847258
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	8.01099112028435
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	5.244279727108247
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	7.162610857496636
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	10.301558021194031
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	7.801789738129147
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	8.283788333675878
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	1.7953177119572696
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lom√© Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	5.632825714263921
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	8.014843792518965
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	7.247424169482478
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?	9.120668340073962
All this is to the good of the consumer.	9.617219648956185
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	6.530009999788603
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	6.966063654631825
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	8.345831171618137
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	5.273126898256872
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	5.509245276049097
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	7.668647878984743
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	8.714663243160192
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	5.539861584161241
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	12.305859830716779
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	8.307055539169822
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	6.121930550844265
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	6.993983522993633
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	10.177623051124096
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	8.223501479437726
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	6.876988413135566
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	6.629680378229945
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	6.1737137027171025
Quite, we agree absolutely.	6.754430558990421
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	7.746389134627406
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	6.8680368438757435
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	5.616765327025634
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	8.397594202237984
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	6.443263399833314
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	8.274962016079854
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	8.265781777097162
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	6.513601886643239
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	4.864101292022535
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	6.86226039103954
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	7.241871146203753
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	6.43860378686282
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	7.39568435763454
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	4.2966810176769235
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	9.679523759121341
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	7.666077867074187
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	6.18394704738201
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	8.96822411434678
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	8.077130371419281
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	8.451141858943698
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.	6.696937617284795
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	7.16884256982024
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	7.103651071513035
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	8.84619400432781
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at S√®te or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	5.841455263569966
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	6.208366545422058
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	7.581066310182393
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	7.486487302942047
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	8.384205261968038
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	6.997184285988937
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	8.554602670566563
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	6.078824249314573
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	8.044122203897015
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	5.562011187746553
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	6.457127415999339
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	8.223990419338088
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	7.391790722497729
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	5.44603654254257
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	6.7608576560418925
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	6.93838982923831
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	5.789070661035393
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	7.7705462597211
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	3.685923092210242
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	11.354204385840893
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	6.999468874344186
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	6.055451764002355
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	9.4634247930698
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	6.645120010551407
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	7.5853118955771395
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	9.600152178355463
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	4.544460492706534
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	4.928375408312068
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	6.572259869345017
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	8.928382530319572
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	7.247064187301767
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	7.444313098793828
We have arrived at the final question.	5.44382928304544
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	6.082189364365371
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	7.992987489682049
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	8.481806059508418
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	9.678588070186512
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	8.76022144432746
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	7.061980331315378
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	6.994799112337375
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the √ñVP and FP√ñ.	5.786003321229974
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	6.537028547953568
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	7.405759105211436
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	7.915226800984146
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	7.26905201015159
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	7.860491298321444
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	6.677707462942673
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	8.496308662215549
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	6.495247632135919
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	10.500259111879057
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	5.5527297959782596
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	7.8725484207593945
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	5.148877099570025
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	8.54713578949269
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	6.475913260819326
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	7.15039705280838
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	8.397645168527411
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	8.59120483684242
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	8.218946226042096
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	7.427094138927751
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	7.879764221854892
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	6.008588037317967
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	8.284797579028176
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	9.93704751706885
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	7.75068758036079
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	6.257434197251287
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	8.066406074169937
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	7.388549440071056
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	7.898203251622239
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	9.064117030072943
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	7.77605900505524
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	7.467409767618147
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	8.001664703620547
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	6.450508279247405
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	15.939907947420677
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	6.079593516383629
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	7.759837792430078
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	9.546818802741946
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	7.247893189612608
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	7.2129895757345865
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	16.146021082088378
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	6.249731888550213
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	8.506941817994758
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	7.910776248390483
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	6.415180826570942
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	6.488579911713352
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	7.801665476736455
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	13.312005439955142
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FP√ñ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SP√ñ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	7.3802230412187075
It is about a Commission which is no more.	10.2955668157014
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	7.576362698754713
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	8.985412725642275
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	4.958310062907655
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	7.111587522239863
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	6.778725337359553
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	6.477354584064833
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	8.020326755647512
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	6.043371247371796
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	8.74330543383813
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	8.241453898835273
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	5.708288421907617
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	7.778112199878393
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	6.797058606764833
This means that we move away from shredding.	8.89185543327323
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	8.510684124254798
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	6.583035915044191
The other question is who should bear the cost.	7.5074762655724365
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	6.251662877391409
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	6.317944712699619
We do not think so.	6.321616240358211
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	6.9369676602690165
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	7.828205201960614
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	6.805681877200741
	14.22659668727896
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	10.664921376697043
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	7.768147220437434
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	7.979980202355141
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	6.418127331239898
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	6.924571529250048
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	7.646206596286779
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	8.709500054203875
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	6.102668745677167
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	3.9396650662647485
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	7.308014814858912
We thank you for that.	13.583622217224738
Adjournment of the session	1.816651520903414
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	3.9404645638001483
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	7.723937372884479
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	5.6394849843151595
We should salute it - and I think we do.	9.088150676090022
Why should we add to them?	9.703812283305458
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	6.757593384576048
The company went under despite this.	5.560388415009565
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	6.266066601107033
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	8.16485505280763
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	7.374177675056577
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	7.687571455621778
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	7.842094575325859
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	6.606724841106053
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	10.013998005326496
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	8.507472826245678
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	7.844758186089078
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	11.494878965989969
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	8.339082535727446
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	4.171229551755717
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	6.675077165393771
Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lom√© model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	6.5688669281783
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	6.888674845748585
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	6.6674621235216796
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	8.326481707813004
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	7.2513321316136565
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	7.711071381285437
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	7.642826925485166
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	7.184342414963025
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	5.31173492875936
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	6.265967106641416
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	8.149274264562482
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	7.184130156125488
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallstr√∂m to Mr Martin?	6.446307839882332
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	7.705569114441067
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	7.678984648557584
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	11.690353227596948
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	7.057816894908581
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	11.083448163643325
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	5.24924649269352
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	6.052293859242573
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	5.365714528218054
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	7.215834855399633
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	7.131500223941322
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	4.5199705686609
A communication later this year will give full details.	6.011262327266482
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	7.476825773036283
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	9.604036893367793
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	9.226396814459592
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallstr√∂m; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	9.888275797179222
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	13.48786655715363
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	8.961998936331616
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	10.753886725876026
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	6.925596512611023
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	9.032119621657673
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	7.9647342650352435
This is where we want to go.	12.77147230052102
Will it be omitted?	19.42572395023619
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	8.33068147697254
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	6.921918756661791
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	7.214329873347029
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	11.347669319561673
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	9.506124520615113
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	6.770536113629995
. As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	8.084913636135035
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	3.6248984580154935
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	8.946883580361394
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	8.04324957095736
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	11.636003405737116
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	10.490905956382043
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	5.912211034443286
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	10.155742757591508
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	5.742417844339434
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	6.864517151628143
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	7.6543103427869195
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	7.939846648518009
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	7.864216216814541
Questions to Mrs Wallstr√∂m	9.525289175507742
First, streamlining.	2.2955787902611626
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	7.7316206340526845
Forgeries are big business.	3.16149882324356
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	6.638180850744556
'Long-winded' .	52.89722204958655
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	3.9440305040876664
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	6.439772974119476
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	8.881302926245729
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	6.574459997280835
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	7.5686386081726384
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	9.188851001882618
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	2.783062523216975
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	8.639820444954616
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	6.752940447547002
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	8.249480722959238
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	9.050206796340415
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	6.021974140576006
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	5.509997047425586
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	7.369487225720188
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	8.342809617134005
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	8.778721408508304
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	5.748682641445942
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	6.012920192899884
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	9.005595014901719
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	7.01820950145633
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	6.130714616688984
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	8.014193876181299
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	7.038448256194382
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	7.737664842761723
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	8.183894326311002
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	7.3079219069902
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	6.7049556720478884
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	9.020824749979303
.	52.89722204958655
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.3888185805878668
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	6.8008865491018655
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	7.947017993094301
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	7.262255462377368
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	6.623083194736468
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	6.301543620502722
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	11.30685083409104
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	7.2296542056630395
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	7.299531189536973
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	6.653538560818392
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	9.613747181385303
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	6.426944825984981
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	10.135402536452883
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.	7.709418085566796
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	9.011160397444245
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	6.524897234440894
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	6.662415507965343
No, you have not done so.	5.279698788666806
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	7.448692278283742
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	7.030398408863003
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	9.51561201986097
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	6.57584498752267
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	6.146146163203444
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	9.026260650605202
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	8.13482089955318
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	6.5716871342913015
It is before Parliament for second reading.	4.839176472708092
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	12.745225477051845
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	7.256150381687797
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	10.275280434518098
I hope that it works out.	15.749583783100222
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	10.103521578358093
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	4.509427927461246
There is no doubt that Mr B√∂ge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	6.859687012743332
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	5.579593424435003
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	7.989907723628282
The two processes are separate processes.	5.299108178155658
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	7.673818323672312
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	7.225781482808226
I would ask him to be brief.	5.785756265124157
Agenda	14.22659668727896
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	5.6264608490813615
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	9.909133115658124
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	8.243504544506841
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	6.445585973580759
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	9.030550016626576
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	4.015964322427819
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	5.275082130871942
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	8.193526353602156
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	6.6964015257335365
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	3.1556174805709327
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	5.620026880817784
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	6.670336142193843
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	8.36848870858933
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	8.95939852846025
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	5.769165752170142
Are we doing enough?	8.755021179857685
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	6.31578464140844
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	8.115542287705308
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect.	7.989069908496273
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	9.186886553228616
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	7.692608047535998
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	7.905390475010017
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	10.018184896346567
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	8.860012172067274
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	10.24386209848462
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	6.734728437511984
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	7.477873613855783
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	5.970097682358297
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	7.821386592715927
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	5.306427550950255
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	4.428830764209083
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	6.330861173243573
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	5.622138495226474
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	8.857261697398538
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	6.21233072760452
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	7.48574113846325
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	8.862012288161859
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	7.090385672846626
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	6.6847223864324645
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	8.621103417353273
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	8.33846794803343
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	9.36544458406088
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	8.087230928499062
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	8.056178749966525
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	7.589062257760508
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	7.9284013377291105
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	4.993256238188224
That is important.	4.450204297502966
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	6.249028289607416
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	6.236832511042145
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	9.225443133130025
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	10.134271542363923
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	8.839646787647109
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	6.856446582005583
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	8.165555189529655
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	8.191954739954777
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	8.512432377654047
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	7.058099651783992
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	6.049061154074944
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	8.249191940606408
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	6.423737641934614
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	9.056931681788136
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	6.838353383484594
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	12.488934510883713
Question Time (Council)	2.398404949983926
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	6.195021062826957
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	11.380337482632944
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	8.05641404655936
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	7.634087765688572
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	10.31360359556815
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	6.281080711157102
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	6.830231369158431
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	7.073528834534666
What should this global actor' s objective be?	6.512240884212564
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	6.650173420642581
I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	6.664414088104264
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	5.1719747411714785
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	4.667299372479415
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	6.928978652419714
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	5.295498795379322
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	7.466380347677201
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.	6.692373692660086
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	6.10677279352204
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	9.295088918143003
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	7.759254516410021
That is transparency.	3.9401536335775935
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.	5.434867888414185
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	7.676719077776474
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	7.496303699488138
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	6.029510551556039
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	6.974127269967006
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	8.762858839312882
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	8.848810778179516
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	7.3225311206444195
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	9.863985195158055
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	7.907004789685992
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	6.343887694824198
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	6.011714547434638
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	4.1599549382077985
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	5.1431822650239285
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	6.053095215425137
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	7.793927521184123
Should we not be discussing this issue?	6.497499388913819
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	6.7327381358834195
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	6.916921089044697
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	8.397650337477584
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	5.490337103190257
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	6.585309464718845
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	6.435855881596303
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr B√∂sch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	7.412356760457709
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	6.770385619752758
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	7.109585068768921
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	7.761874027958717
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	8.087322106205528
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	7.262443992848668
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	8.8045063361507
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	10.695914582849072
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	7.650136907525944
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	7.96013502721107
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	8.162260747887455
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	8.21596433356436
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	7.223903876720866
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	7.309007491707618
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	7.334354494047755
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	10.680973009005035
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	7.903152664700583
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	5.8387558878979195
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	7.508357533505088
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	6.728924088913303
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	6.046507231317718
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	5.757156235479236
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	7.423065939117419
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	2.627108672628644
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	8.426338634438048
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	7.512410053903607
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	8.246294573715298
We know that you have an important role in this.	6.884035854283783
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	6.010176213713445
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	8.1552097649586
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	7.568617602977348
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	6.091897362291596
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	9.510313844818182
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	8.343789651060588
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	8.556294460341448
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	8.462779548636673
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	6.7269506693834105
This is why this report is so important.	8.199694227226821
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	6.619381149184142
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	6.745375315015465
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	8.800247132804367
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	6.424766108811081
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	7.130357560100092
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	5.557929554194175
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	8.054514120273076
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	7.259714351408922
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue.	5.610469475073016
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	5.562221731676445
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	8.071582905920918
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
Thank you, Mr President.	5.14685273811621
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	7.456957724188602
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	8.100787229811965
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	6.405794315808222
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	8.100176301233052
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sj√∂stedt and others have asked.	7.683954480246149
Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS))	2.1997934261431342
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	1.1438227504289553
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	8.67707358949026
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	11.626640879323944
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	6.130154765419839
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	10.886341447203066
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	7.411725697119429
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	9.220127322877014
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	7.69901714278552
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	7.803960180427891
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	9.014751990934036
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	9.239236347471063
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	9.10660227598046
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	5.310832604721631
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	8.501150582751869
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	7.074771464260728
We belong together, even when there are problems.	7.395485772038529
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	7.016185311964366
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	7.923890140668271
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	8.4712775390748
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	9.836901041268877
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	7.095105473137846
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	7.1810561519925376
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	7.515563679096727
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	6.181978714922534
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	6.10680610046951
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	10.578276448088861
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	7.318299933447048
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	9.900952909498473
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	7.34439005929109
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	9.63633125078965
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	4.445580523074825
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	11.80498405025943
Macedonia did not go through a war.	8.680416188513261
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	9.942763938255666
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	5.718320234981269
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	9.223613609516747
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	8.212852842567186
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	8.380109593145871
Additives in feedingstuffs	56.70135493200264
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	7.61399720914325
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	7.818732258620919
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	8.853532043340778
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	6.281020796576586
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	7.0216087907059865
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	7.505279546264925
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	10.594341759683202
The labour market is also changing.	6.392493632035738
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	7.496213389524898
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	6.761696584983277
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	6.490765564824711
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	8.831030251071882
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	8.196829995485428
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	1.1438227504289553
It would be politically astute not to isolate the √ñVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the √ñVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	7.64520614747819
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	8.313783622991064
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	6.804238345485006
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	7.360822465028721
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	7.323652240173487
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	8.754599868005508
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	9.650504368809539
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	8.50755675832809
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	7.054672324053152
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	19.213550749297983
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	9.416311412107015
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	6.312057974843257
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	6.728047432228661
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	8.795423168378765
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	7.053883456623836
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	1.162056305492263
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	7.5307084168585465
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	7.3570866524473155
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	6.126803875752081
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	7.2393194529394895
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	6.973085528102978
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	8.217197840663008
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	7.978283522634802
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.301217852809603
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	7.440827478434894
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	5.742011914532457
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	9.464308323793924
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	6.454908027581107
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	7.607585143087807
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	8.325158110214415
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	8.589631836175629
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	6.9009707354556795
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	6.231380215915417
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	10.056496314618084
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	9.71884874280538
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	7.470110625075228
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	5.781367504069862
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	12.813191905083832
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	6.042994367269519
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	6.026458314225974
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements, which Foreign Minister Sch√ºssel has failed to condemn."	6.194951795877037
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	7.2002204130053205
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	1.162056305492263
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	2.544189265811013
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	5.8540426279083455
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective.	8.054423244211716
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	4.694745476341606
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	8.690014292274302
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	8.185237825038152
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	6.402003928570294
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	8.593823261856897
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	5.7695388062109325
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	7.430797857158914
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	7.6621822180366985
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	6.359586828882415
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	9.290031203774692
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	7.696101707602781
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	7.411406639848495
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	10.0915138586906
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	7.503292644239731
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	8.132626769786501
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	7.865419202185151
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	7.807767187809694
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	10.008545376550932
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	8.949347302357499
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	6.331065300479879
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	6.3296753412179685
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	3.562972271492141
What concrete measures have been discussed?	6.669057957105886
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	8.352836788065233
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	7.228535217553621
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	4.843025933969751
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	8.938467303596934
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	6.150269750905598
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gas√≤liba.	8.262951628931395
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	6.780257871410168
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	8.018181267798429
Our own staff policy is outdated.	5.152248668642156
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	6.704052475299447
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	8.039672870452353
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	5.782707395386554
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	8.827226808420214
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	5.770832803085507
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.03113371785076
This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers.	9.625886357076691
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	8.754929692633599
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	7.277153865783547
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	4.563410259049819
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	7.569760683399906
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	8.429735816039118
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	11.160688117683506
Why not?	93.61992755357687
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	6.080816950333171
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	7.721407049103411
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	10.103129338519548
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	10.22634849311789
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	5.731343313132518
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	7.19405866862828
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	6.659761959211687
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	9.239789401715957
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	6.254719951422224
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	7.674257103314953
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	5.295013805405402
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	6.734514887278118
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	5.2919816394852885
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	6.304669107316526
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	5.078507585135014
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr B√∂ge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	7.194607454025127
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	7.812565865414741
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	7.904068653721036
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	6.067955785542753
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	7.60903656517948
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	7.0323941992348304
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	6.7341949031211445
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	8.029114199621178
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	6.473327217749478
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	7.872057775167859
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	7.74286027198042
This event must underpin enlargement.	4.808472267769957
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	6.097839494744683
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	7.296385852386262
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	6.190495383034758
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	2.765308622828233
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	7.144479424831932
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	8.36483327062443
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	7.675762066569941
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	7.0991689386729115
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	7.187092363030224
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German L√§nder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	8.176732174460167
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	6.460756337828026
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	6.258251524947028
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	6.662756621358799
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	6.160382116040051
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	7.9813486318311
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	7.123441790036465
(The Minutes were adopted)	7.715266291026839
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	9.954431346211772
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	5.469637502297964
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	6.907184180885445
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	5.834806876923115
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	6.817531351407483
So what do we need to happen immediately?	12.881552045152871
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	6.808387347318915
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	9.315205694217799
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	7.409791088683073
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	7.891417372664871
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	5.8489390438948154
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	7.709444561996016
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	13.192174757229736
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	9.174511426440615
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	8.301285309943264
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atat√ºrk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.6181224833675003
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	7.320953494778371
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	9.116949346574733
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	7.302744830396184
We must never forget to defend civil society.	5.307336484543692
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	7.5685459722217425
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	6.840119071952623
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	5.759399366907419
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	8.419156515057955
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	9.685998563458208
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	7.8988716348797645
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	9.968744049090112
First of all, civil society.	10.563935984970998
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	5.9732061323006285
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	6.012636179316865
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.	6.001304893607635
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	7.47994170368488
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	4.518306504649118
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	8.736476358562248
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	7.251117188125846
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	8.723794501441231
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	5.951869680433893
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	8.019456958789476
No, of course not.	22.626869760098575
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	7.412655477697363
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	7.702867963988027
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	6.135262696020517
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.	5.955653097570328
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	9.813937290976419
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	7.788020861614268
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	8.46975986753342
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	8.965392167627892
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	7.439992164941666
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	6.737562486335241
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	7.3458679975497905
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	6.8834978464261525
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	6.716146214255993
Whose turn is next?	5.823347607933675
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	7.672440516120829
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	10.056039860599927
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	7.771463465749448
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	7.892476307319708
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	7.352594157656555
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	8.078717257878647
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	4.720067153278651
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	6.3273181890278085
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	6.89020191366001
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	7.868509289407916
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	6.525274703558964
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	7.446245402070449
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	7.228041365514603
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	8.176442547615247
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	7.2986032630881885
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	6.733820052464971
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	9.597448588123353
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	6.894045795647581
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	10.590631350942761
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	7.66856709858851
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	8.471784483016862
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	4.4780363548320095
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	7.024240878941938
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-√†-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	6.56019050873276
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	5.470287699365997
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .	7.177296873461516
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	6.377589102241412
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	4.8767650223077315
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	8.238946537684392
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	5.76857098296844
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer' s liability.	6.873270922534509
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	8.162590944228194
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	6.29548801327419
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	6.615953734889903
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	4.559373471406202
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	6.98608214280769
Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003.	5.643138550470712
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	7.5414468119248115
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Kn√∂rr Borr√†s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	1.7504673897024166
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	7.925389787567263
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	9.130614272671629
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	9.122911375955884
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	8.26884767589345
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	9.135878247112732
Its argument was one of priority.	6.7362890155304544
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	7.943179639165638
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	6.071481276303167
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	8.662596940306345
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourri√®re' s report.	4.563128570554975
-	14.22659668727896
The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	5.67972423406312
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	7.077260825494637
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	6.555105498029659
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	4.62080951303481
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	6.412668994104908
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	8.243113346469839
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	7.406951666722055
How can those affected be compensated?	5.975159125510598
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	7.733213900113687
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	7.401192027943749
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	7.386662621912634
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	5.92000746566245
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	7.053132330737172
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	7.374238842053537
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	5.733130582292076
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	7.66781649325336
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	8.361795537113872
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	7.0417042411729796
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	7.734541361715319
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	9.491238199986089
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright.	8.89815237608919
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	7.80839517568107
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	7.935169817751404
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	6.181201356997744
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	6.920258675038643
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	6.286116192265011
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	7.5541435840872095
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	7.735421015467523
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	10.740605742126805
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	6.302065107498617
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	6.841581251731995
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	6.796215457847876
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	7.210219510413577
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	6.738783913338842
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	5.213032705419358
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	6.207076185726909
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	7.468773742178538
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	6.751450863921996
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	7.113019980913534
I can only fully share your concern.	9.869472707763379
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	11.25791766563377
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	11.836647612911543
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	7.425561762538514
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	7.36897195535333
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	7.398789652852224
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	7.466404946045468
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	2.503189412980793
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	7.497660505835082
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	8.178930868522508
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	8.253319496423911
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	7.0045396228516905
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	7.201597670111886
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	5.062670675564075
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	5.355104753459201
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	5.652688595467188
Mr President, there is a mystery.	17.09353831053624
The number of departments has been reduced.	14.491387490170217
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	6.709157046565675
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	6.485400227221154
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	7.043539168257462
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	13.802257666652778
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	8.681183854281166
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	7.191165410787902
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	6.155765623968986
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	8.103433663223914
And it is still on the agenda today.	11.706518281281811
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	6.380328105685907
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	5.8006872814935795
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	7.184074774108854
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	4.922695542287102
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	6.3245975269708214
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	8.486424265869564
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	9.540047296443632
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	8.74037819514093
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and J√∂rg Haider' s Freedom Party.	5.621089954398886
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	6.0099366180966065
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	3.7966555680775445
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	7.566472467951208
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	7.50168027713797
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	8.525907903825752
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	5.813761808506196
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	6.429521892932492
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	5.572579188626595
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	8.47874650165267
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	7.463880543515039
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	6.847921915177836
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	6.167650731897877
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	6.345852281618432
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	7.200541899588087
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	8.2279613070854
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	8.066508411582964
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	6.832657440384098
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	7.928830840403494
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	8.00700416100613
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	6.965974192133065
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	7.4514774793312935
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	6.182734447107481
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	6.102215517435106
Let us just consider for a moment.	6.003110323749394
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	9.72764298896894
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	5.970700630464353
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	8.5724125267068
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	8.066742731573031
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	6.2150294941223905
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	8.512958772040179
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	7.352103629989241
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	7.361025830636966
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	6.938285408625071
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	9.299213434634481
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	6.027716550977857
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	6.538926426974355
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	7.942100166969649
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	5.567465075001744
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	6.309619044002959
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	5.4279080394752794
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	8.93216544151593
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	7.021364247306382
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	6.425827106828819
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	8.843198804604702
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	8.563526226884159
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	8.446079381489819
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	8.971676906497624
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	6.567462099787075
So that is at least a step forward.	9.435716951479883
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lom√©, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	7.642523495628962
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	7.8401670157203105
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	7.4400937407411085
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	6.449007499626777
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	7.471635302133021
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	9.089122925714456
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	9.585568556316598
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	8.019822249929325
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	8.047105485754281
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	8.53972322573207
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	7.342053183077223
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	7.2491208570711905
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	8.620576175303027
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	7.942761504648749
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	5.866537618505326
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	8.991825372819607
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	9.791928137610368
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	7.58826790038911
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	6.251219722148943
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	6.82540069118499
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	6.442695528351224
Who will provide us with new jobs?	7.180380593552856
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	4.901345003912319
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	7.040920403695775
Things could well continue in the same way.	4.785264241826823
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	7.8002429805618805
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	5.957403050907333
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	7.148783047522496
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	10.30967773276473
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	5.962599054046247
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	7.3946185891600065
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	6.460493025708953
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	6.891484502721343
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	11.124082064097351
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	5.539302018018973
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	7.12464553647476
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	8.387966496766264
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	7.455221736421234
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	5.791764339146185
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	7.880182524931784
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	7.527442007317741
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	7.280084726050971
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	6.634153928195026
So we come back to the previous problem.	8.01343562129658
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	6.441783820959494
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	6.866944657481163
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr R√ºbig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	8.593631986402094
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	9.0099338466239
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	10.342148732455966
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	5.989551728709437
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	6.750034898050406
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	4.828593372580089
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	10.182542681769442
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	9.57270285730283
I will give you an example.	2.894927843437805
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	7.780148552486221
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	12.52694214961459
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	6.999706416740768
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	6.234504895013695
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	7.329988674649766
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	6.479061988025318
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	7.156596551968451
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	8.27814322793208
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	7.701710864193228
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	7.600054947261903
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	3.5283187577018977
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	5.988450292483458
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	7.8285301181572535
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than J√∂rg Haider.	9.874928060572715
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	6.280703212619184
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	10.527187158319467
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	7.2193685562196155
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	9.635869078421132
It concerns the next IGC.	12.295057477349243
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	5.863334034536252
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	7.386647414670191
Since then, expectations have been high.	9.261727154222685
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	5.326689522339051
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	8.661439110992083
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	4.963059575633486
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	7.200721535874893
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	8.961923771565674
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	8.69796560811992
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	8.681469656394341
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	6.962972344179111
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	5.910658918579179
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	8.033062557555004
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	8.601274851843577
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	10.081559180871452
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	6.880494008871292
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	7.3823553775923685
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	8.198890583016773
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	6.976520645173642
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	8.428270628448992
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	7.22752992518095
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	6.523679250862091
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	8.140899620119503
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	9.466810906576361
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	7.543367907771915
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	6.1049023259431765
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	8.678572281069176
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	9.72367191879361
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	6.283254637580895
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	7.507041959683163
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	7.378584593187476
It is an excellent report.	3.7714933322986477
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	6.166159435182924
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	7.079216491264896
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	8.084051479161895
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	5.737787041894118
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	8.488215642093955
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	9.516867225122404
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	7.298893068269898
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	7.774486196684839
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	7.609888239018538
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	5.999013197378878
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	5.929410317860947
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	10.903175052623602
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	8.76064914510815
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	3.4855173192166196
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	9.786352481440144
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	6.800474402665834
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	7.869340942938771
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	8.025981528655922
For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	6.009129846000536
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts.	7.184406514390165
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	7.925876127744526
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	5.918647910541486
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	9.383318050249462
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	9.755549432610277
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	8.43049548272216
Thank you for your reply.	2.2378188009001114
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	8.424321776780852
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	6.968699552571594
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	8.5848150195279
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	6.424470201547468
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	9.796281803207611
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	4.365687936862556
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	9.16278591995142
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	4.925625439353557
Have the lessons not been learnt?	6.6940748591180474
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	7.587585436819682
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	9.680978613609572
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	8.211319714663693
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	4.8483391572941175
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	5.3295109131617755
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	6.446331578829246
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	8.447383212582888
This war must be stopped.	4.756411866920211
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	8.649925219082403
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	9.301071766154507
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	9.00792350449716
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	6.307805053823873
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	7.094140771268822
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	8.446467133406268
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	10.748703415998222
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	7.379545939950819
VOTE	14.22659668727896
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	9.54342432231048
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	7.637109957748718
I wonder how this will develop.	6.3543035185048655
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	6.637709512137573
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	6.57236250399089
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	6.891677830342973
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements.	8.337271154185704
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.9700177847790978
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	7.900683708427031
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	8.394992462982964
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	7.642625690169844
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	7.00402276937141
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	7.431042554612047
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	6.530755572000005
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	6.46770594182617
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	6.090269977995499
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	9.219400716378727
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	7.587430388051403
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	8.043278449039065
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	7.16091370679324
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	4.766148980969945
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	7.748074577041071
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	7.231375537133728
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	8.518411360236021
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	9.512207820631176
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	9.49736865647147
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	8.5206083629738
.	52.89722204958655
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	11.098224129969914
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	8.242023796181718
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	6.753341425070839
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	6.427010878025143
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	6.776940519301254
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	7.301443636099376
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	6.998479174551276
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	8.847465106262996
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	5.392241627630274
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	8.344623628780845
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	7.623442215741842
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	7.5738198640306
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	5.051764419953307
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	6.95538024554897
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	7.450869039370196
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	6.593067442055412
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	6.97891537382801
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	8.065984114026136
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	3.131381837548873
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	5.190346771966331
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	9.024708471811255
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	6.2325300472930945
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	8.544957546320871
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	8.994846047065332
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	7.654866161030287
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	7.476567652370803
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	9.90165844828474
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	7.129093436687653
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	8.28022631918671
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	8.666229567285583
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	7.700426994321567
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	5.135490935106014
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	6.4735298409225335
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	4.197725719297755
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	7.856907105053138
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	5.897634547626902
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	7.181953953363267
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	7.456089905192617
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	1.7903491917013432
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	6.98192626436734
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	7.164526806042371
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	9.039166638551366
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	7.046185927636375
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	8.267927628629982
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	11.19155836918075
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	8.182523030319947
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	9.868321972603004
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	5.775817728195002
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	10.986022452217494
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	11.84931531534833
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	8.472793392005975
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	8.267615474217852
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	6.759186706534347
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	7.211813811275062
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	7.652722437162333
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	7.141503817714699
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	6.935041864343578
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	7.37988614736468
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	7.978942294725423
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	5.6256331382423
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	4.219658253380989
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	15.78324583531077
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	8.768319408444507
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	8.93738887788215
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	5.923796898316874
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	10.71521760180117
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	7.610066208533302
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	5.844283800672836
Nor is it a mere luxury.	9.291563136638821
What we need here is an integral approach.	8.319270009921507
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	7.63714814379365
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	5.92470321102847
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	7.375465604753832
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	8.783004011976143
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	9.06166241587708
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	6.728133581947152
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	6.3935427119988955
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	6.350039523359929
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	8.977525771043279
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	8.2556366446877
Rapid action is called for!	8.826190586159665
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	7.384788469520418
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	8.130660087861909
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	7.61307794191882
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	3.5946921897816764
It should continue along this path.	3.190120939098469
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	8.032424058183382
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	6.652365994979361
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	9.235653773292112
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	7.455577129589675
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades.	5.851327126549996
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	7.815572683898799
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	9.68639349837382
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	8.540338863461361
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	9.113270754126066
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	9.95816646379995
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	8.827979561898227
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	7.872728902331011
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	7.698937562584879
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	7.3224362174519655
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	6.418883082367279
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.171728838303529
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	6.881927499908347
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	7.46618681239691
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	8.28586270132297
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaqu√≠n Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	6.033808020834213
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	5.402520122149792
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	8.155189272937227
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	7.001645748549965
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	4.979493088270062
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	5.013910068654793
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	7.086472947073038
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	6.779838716451865
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	6.738082935575125
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	10.16463091297888
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	10.50788686369867
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	9.937978860972903
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	7.574855555746956
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	5.6550694285850485
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	7.849546844287552
This will therefore be our rule.	8.618362300349014
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	8.159730046236342
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	7.961191880969924
I will mention two point that may create tension.	6.623922780138067
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	9.422947738490887
I cannot answer that question.	2.9092893250426757
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	4.707406917367567
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	10.24908445976457
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	6.2546197308455564
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	7.260284493253318
The internal market is the basis for our work.	11.727467218675413
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	8.743033197068238
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	13.600862246968637
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	8.596144425205287
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.972487966703713
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	6.7104585563511385
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	8.722164680419507
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschi√∂ld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	3.946947297279812
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	7.06164364600618
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	7.111378513190027
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	6.476348973662252
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	5.480039504369698
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	6.721210902707727
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	8.251045307340632
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	1.976428455367054
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.563489818211283
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	6.029064515477639
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	7.756550348349423
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	7.1557889286928535
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	7.420107922844651
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	6.6634163253271765
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	8.754385790055117
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	9.366909344198268
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	6.014428914375697
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	9.255459601873316
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	6.218156924755807
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	8.29994738251303
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	7.251544797097214
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	6.846601637678805
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	6.305905751986237
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	14.830760539210926
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	9.508798344571785
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	8.16610205774615
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	8.148211723907671
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	6.793374626600407
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	7.761477277956918
The strength of the FP√ñ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	7.8736993160411135
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	7.021612499784105
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	7.605458524647997
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	13.179596286924623
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	7.19120215328493
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	7.247538621897156
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	5.432699791282042
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	6.629104432648615
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	7.192809804249049
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	7.904182722207084
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	9.321735495435522
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	5.815552995551961
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	7.1633633569287
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	8.028734254868265
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	7.920259844371791
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.537323772626463
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	8.418132804570455
Those could perpetuate an infection.	4.117342479817961
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	8.637878068434402
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	7.552484177902431
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	7.032247752892043
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	6.895212892141177
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	7.041492704367323
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	6.228659733889287
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	9.701258522540208
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	6.53650934168408
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	7.093936184713924
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	9.172841328457498
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	8.004935200763962
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	7.700591527089077
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	7.807743219499946
We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	7.092495284071973
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	8.65206071098174
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	6.275280679861729
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	11.989093945781054
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	4.424038389447315
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	10.417323746675233
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	7.792792659635239
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	6.859993364877477
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	5.440693062159722
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	8.602114664900032
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	6.811666837189645
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	4.004316700259326
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	8.477783506746862
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	7.764570609024424
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	8.405372790476408
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	8.226425848502117
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	6.797644948653536
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	6.641676464104015
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	11.25580836102546
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	7.865413155371103
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	7.437253076805647
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	5.525985863525924
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	7.105273697596837
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	8.12864710266973
The first is a policy of persuasion.	9.825155709078746
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	6.885492938569394
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	7.436124251761888
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	10.83122169591422
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	7.896002773692472
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	3.0899981895152178
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	4.630976012670927
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	7.092577764180252
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	6.807496285718835
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	7.990756229845381
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	7.247027678738449
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	7.057206537826999
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	6.2481991758466675
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	6.3589770941819435
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	7.04047151492597
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	8.514135006038313
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	4.256559544197105
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	9.119910695221913
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	6.802329728013575
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	8.571194411449238
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	7.959160753846916
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	8.32638190148994
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	9.658350591155099
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	7.530081912697446
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	6.01824894328297
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	8.190130670258764
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	8.10048141282129
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	6.990433846807959
I am terribly sorry, Mr H√§nsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	6.230660362126762
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	9.181361118455484
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	7.4164646999868715
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	8.317721713749163
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	5.843177371823399
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	6.2868991133657355
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	7.782004900188572
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	6.676523153760663
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	6.490497973258842
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	4.33753148061435
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	3.997321399886653
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	21.013991118339245
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	7.229022799381601
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	9.442386232258649
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterl√∏n, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	6.515922012732893
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	6.57438742191498
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	8.903818684934825
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	8.302734167117748
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	8.621665556286093
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	8.077623527056662
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	8.367467305435847
The German version is not very clear here.	9.633875047877495
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	16.995040615997105
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	9.049698834523467
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	7.836260599987316
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	8.241470484526953
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	7.599323854598357
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	7.991551952761384
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	7.9777171036754515
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	8.667079083311773
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	8.482714315576022
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	6.874166182070614
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	6.4003925359819345
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	7.3168355864620915
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	6.763595757654715
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	7.256348858405648
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	8.487312235968442
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	7.37934327277289
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	11.640516662798799
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	6.458556818936646
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	8.206393643432607
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	5.423828434831564
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	7.504673866950759
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	7.896938644134949
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	6.459495443447779
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	5.677647451754074
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	7.636182756928423
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	6.099556013278356
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	7.47360027819331
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	6.3188633841212045
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	8.119465418022212
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	10.639667116493536
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?	9.149785364239674
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	7.602427360456006
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	5.519504586493796
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	9.037156308310609
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	6.727865406943716
The principle also concerns water charging.	5.632041935794667
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	9.744635954028936
Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	10.968422534989754
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	7.109239932305318
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	9.903745772200814
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	5.339945617338383
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	9.363832200940948
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	9.15114532343206
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, Jos√© Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	8.090893922009059
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	7.1252601861892
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	8.171579189407499
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	6.782011909097941
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	8.248455031719603
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	6.501775919600535
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	7.871565206616063
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	4.450228426980122
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	7.6882365012212075
How would you describe this?	8.24575237773167
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	7.3828182957399635
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	6.116361912684662
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	6.1402609530274495
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	1.7953177119572696
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	5.743065574294181
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	4.964723112470362
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	6.057826843215218
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	7.096195650676497
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	5.9396777275048445
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	5.245677008665824
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	8.110524194809416
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	8.335637438491236
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	7.668972601068513
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	7.184612662096376
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	7.577753501962444
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	9.45706062945874
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	9.56604529374399
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	6.80671838537835
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	5.391604166949396
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	9.030686072152069
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	7.111606136626238
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	6.136850155223189
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	7.804492663087286
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	5.543118858981352
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	8.567575927631754
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	6.917511957741682
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	8.904307588115113
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	9.311366072142041
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	4.8700451337416215
Is this speculative?	4.721367690611925
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	8.235536346252834
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	13.401468326827246
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	7.044511942913545
Action must get under way immediately.	5.169351336194945
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	8.121601823671353
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	6.165381794963759
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	8.262204801903737
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	7.372104869416499
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	7.222349352616147
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	4.899564672082022
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	6.49531110052879
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	2.8874959760925534
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	6.913885235015818
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	5.42177514505529
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	7.668294762576648
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	7.079804027874249
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	7.379544095169972
We cannot be accused of bad management.	7.556439047767973
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	7.973952551262292
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	9.735994692807743
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	9.293882440587172
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	13.558711286387457
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	8.843295537048489
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	10.666530073907376
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	6.965747663597996
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	9.00963481459194
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	7.728715393835187
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	5.949433066109675
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	7.678988021877888
These are serious allegations.	7.520729479471353
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	10.042829019288437
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	8.508926915225565
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	6.899739714837653
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	5.43196939581325
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	8.045319708764966
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	8.004012774578165
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	6.893928978963285
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	7.049907557017776
That it is what we are doing.	9.282644776440147
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	7.7193753114697365
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	8.11932662149502
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	11.520489105722369
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	8.291452841499355
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	6.448928810793487
I have good reason for asking this.	6.53225387814102
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	8.043486926057003
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	7.895929609907676
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	6.969997724105706
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	9.010335498679755
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	7.864076914479642
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	6.964704880106568
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	6.299531694507103
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	9.851648270433687
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	9.253166271261742
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	7.701380285492828
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	6.796553556262014
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	6.860305175506556
The time for resolutions has passed.	7.831828122933146
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	8.753018604603403
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	6.490393009494688
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	8.391422451998013
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	10.069803722575973
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	7.303279285903373
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	5.505378215107667
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	6.090036294849208
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lom√© Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	10.020334311179514
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	7.171653252950731
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	8.73423546939668
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	5.619089862607514
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	8.103159695433446
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	7.090788529842099
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	3.6822367141658394
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	6.89960999084218
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	4.903324173692873
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	6.719943785848292
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	7.9311838996793025
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	7.471969944612895
I hope that this will be of benefit.	6.870103118426245
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	8.372935801114405
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	6.77172778256171
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	7.803761597115747
.	52.89722204958655
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	6.129061023890971
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	6.718528395555172
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	6.425591309715653
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	6.862298255913415
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	7.343619926507355
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	7.332169938831991
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	6.92126079733768
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	5.9457606992372884
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	7.142986678391932
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	7.761017803824922
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	4.5009041153770015
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	6.624692277881963
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	6.217414417007497
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	8.252739558805045
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	8.343488368501813
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	2.229155664184556
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	10.390018948924236
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	7.7965087504851756
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	7.52202054110943
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	7.342317911155328
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	7.393835276024532
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	7.061232256857435
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	9.57019249515996
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	8.357084340895849
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	6.750682510313758
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	6.289443625147595
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	7.831772727156776
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	8.26788784955889
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	7.469784512974685
Cederschi√∂ld report (A5-0020/2000)	1.0720115699223667
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	8.486495201216798
Reform of European competition policy	3.1737872274385497
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	7.8237456568602175
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	8.161824441631401
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	6.087026647315882
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	7.024923614653877
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	5.556006885081173
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	8.607329624197904
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	9.992786788299684
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Kn√∂rr Borr√†s of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	7.288501835435185
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	7.539277667063699
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	5.534570477159606
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	9.411579181935428
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	7.392454369389269
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	7.499735466514685
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	7.189284274614763
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	6.626616456377888
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	9.640785085300731
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	10.168579440182773
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	4.560226325477373
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	9.463243178316961
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	7.64368693566747
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	6.96017532859485
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	6.61098083515097
. As Mrs Wallstr√∂m explained during yesterday's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	3.7966805122363643
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	10.152847797874294
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	7.4973396116643105
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	6.255409857221891
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	8.14775372113109
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	7.793219746597945
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	7.4948332243632905
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	7.053956842156694
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	8.743851488424943
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	11.042692196163161
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	7.204013609163917
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	7.590216870233557
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	5.360419362965291
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	5.986894089879412
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	7.141313444889503
Modernising social protection	54.52898181227755
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	8.454656964658978
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	6.538727722457663
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	6.962205805517245
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	8.440883622023954
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	8.635806884961807
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	9.004993480469906
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	8.466512899817126
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	4.818877747192637
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	7.594554078886808
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, is on the spot today.	6.101860522464631
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	5.859938198340769
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	8.829322814773358
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	9.101373171706472
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	7.517382307669285
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	10.10307082883453
What has been done about training?	19.195061617977288
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	6.576211296571678
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	6.549310120285118
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	7.542333223832223
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	7.8884674053068355
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	10.377174891511997
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	7.753915331812702
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	7.3721536143131745
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	7.808879619644207
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from J√∂rg Haider' s Freedom Party.	5.572624011785318
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	6.5566512155051075
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	9.538261247288752
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	8.008230333218032
Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights	5.461894991825964
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	8.816580321931491
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	5.4530166410267595
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	7.373460696781761
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	9.987135219566293
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	5.432536351261586
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	8.42715499128505
It seems contradictory.	2.5867252412762434
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	6.817856608674552
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	8.77865907556119
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	8.538855987769775
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	8.008079129036577
Welcome	14.22659668727896
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	8.553894497721242
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	7.528988909470676
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	9.222410089255773
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	6.959270364300702
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	6.857422462562337
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	5.77734203906918
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	7.193632427434819
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	8.358775285941741
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	6.5565460407351965
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	7.745471782114264
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	4.1501229997318285
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	7.409811753085966
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor' s main interests" .	5.071703045817243
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	4.399573313198192
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	8.34260794635569
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	8.792311533843169
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	5.194932324360254
I would like Mr Bar√≥n Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	9.314159377396589
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	9.780799194454396
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	6.557327157915991
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	7.668095882848641
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	6.469830234395983
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	7.681902499702929
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	5.817054345166362
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	5.508456823763154
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	6.728583049100528
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	7.035196550867032
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	11.580959662983174
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	4.4882080026081415
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	6.787122203557874
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	6.929246528460066
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	7.24107721370621
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	7.830312144457181
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	7.8093025036240356
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	3.883026334645052
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	10.741208464751233
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	6.613225482126732
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	11.22408026559221
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	6.957036045011879
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	7.856210876014027
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	7.242787375194149
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	11.19035464683792
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	7.743363914016735
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	4.191026964921508
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourri√®re' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	6.29522699959389
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	11.710095487846505
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	6.044439254238286
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	6.523391724868586
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	1.832481310221994
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	9.472750791207481
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	8.983945981763197
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	7.434991664705629
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	5.967670404171118
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	6.912158361121068
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	7.671726055183751
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	7.679797318720147
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	7.338347195019141
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	8.574795111015293
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	6.301929523939364
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	7.670410770730673
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	9.384132898623943
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person' s ethnic origin.	8.318742472203846
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	7.92463446202314
And yet our President is a fine economist.	7.053691126127188
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	8.050619687184273
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	6.024104903289914
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	8.578416776494338
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	6.288823918249874
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-√†-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	7.2275174007939835
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	7.39913149013503
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	6.106709275294723
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	7.833626171790605
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	7.641858653463769
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	6.380163666429397
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	7.591341229233362
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	6.807518176336116
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	6.103657493046117
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	7.63459848162784
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	7.7336924850274915
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	5.8738816377521825
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	6.312577750624867
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	9.402233348263321
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	7.550056620677799
I welcome you and your ambition.	6.4008919056380424
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	8.822286726849278
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	6.218236569079044
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	6.668049765334212
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	7.811445752068446
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	7.480539580922167
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	7.210773114166616
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	8.703067399961373
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	4.149810976015897
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Bar√≥n Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	7.908350549296645
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	6.2446357403500405
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	7.719727368183421
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	6.960423817886632
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	8.85623092224687
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	7.512935734269354
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	7.865754520188853
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	6.924962844813009
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	7.302806954764225
I would be in favour of its doing so.	11.15869577514973
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	4.608649428928212
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	7.175085903360909
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	4.966035462756189
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	8.811251575010703
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	9.015046405328878
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	7.531990559821971
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	17.161929816149843
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	8.304898729115113
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	7.481551605593975
Mr R√ºbig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	6.244712359251095
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	4.8737293172645195
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	8.026367104482103
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	6.872974281933519
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	7.227751915668887
The plant is not yet there.	11.519961497510845
.	52.89722204958655
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	7.593835800752525
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	7.538133363481491
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	7.339959449493544
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	7.847165379835757
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	6.88050954495438
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	6.135423316266662
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	5.882943143091174
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	8.598403110299065
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	6.562259402110105
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	7.964711699937335
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	6.1253823802937815
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	7.408145440759079
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	7.909590029882632
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	8.108239412220236
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	7.419634324993126
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	7.646313381641949
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	6.544942025456245
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	6.854921401669778
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	10.73309580081514
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	2.1556144951880007
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	8.23527423493567
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	7.380903854577745
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	9.137077339078004
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	6.9391042048412475
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	3.851807185273731
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	5.681491503516416
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	7.126414206238054
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	8.370096707936627
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	8.043040276204762
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	7.305552072653322
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	7.748516403888313
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	6.5203847933613615
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	8.182466898161532
The project has been long and problematic.	5.628996130893634
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	6.733452662011933
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	8.7438287544613
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	9.252046740921198
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	8.025326661852857
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	7.819320069325514
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	1.217438706636806
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	7.908696196309977
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	9.030620739828091
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	6.421841630670528
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	7.641406852634969
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	8.035764459765893
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of Jos√© Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	6.95554967144017
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	8.770621585638384
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	9.059561772622352
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	8.552441224683676
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	4.860752108657768
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	7.442879966302519
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	7.797537279786451
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	6.945173048025096
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	6.387358171735546
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	6.48479208041942
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	7.902094351999171
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	6.957675259958643
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	11.020209089604302
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	7.922592046235753
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	5.877826808592937
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	8.657949981457216
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	7.795986879155526
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	7.74846110617391
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	6.611600141687594
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	6.570739006896101
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	7.909786261436911
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	7.935918433451585
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	6.6970487399661085
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	7.287623679421402
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	7.963735282848692
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	7.86050263294126
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	7.138909984102246
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	7.769252971201346
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	6.619111105425402
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	4.9414562409345155
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	7.716387240245747
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	7.36539217762139
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	7.733045736479326
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	7.659613865013386
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	7.158431739957952
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	7.2227527677242405
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	5.880457212951754
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	7.636417225167094
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	7.410825982958923
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	5.221903297191103
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	8.731424408087559
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	4.078253926520205
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	8.203432559688078
The next Lom√© Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	5.888920700144762
(Loud, sustained applause from the centre and from the right, protests from the left)	9.459038005244546
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	7.281666889288335
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	5.328331832289927
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	7.288625594163456
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	8.723600762730962
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	7.562962642368486
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	6.223746469864442
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	7.147184152203316
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	7.23384563668398
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	8.0022982169155
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	7.227962427919632
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	9.029568789006584
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	8.322658911593582
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	6.779172145367617
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	1.1438227504289553
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallstr√∂m, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	6.560358548794207
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	7.5629039449960205
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	6.593445526984186
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	6.8847840143827845
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	9.514657952497032
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	6.906171525636349
We are losing market share.	5.374660965734361
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	9.58531024679631
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	8.510150718569736
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	8.768563582174881
Thank you very much Commissioner.	5.553739806047534
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	5.310483664577146
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	7.474284197911906
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	8.243647961935645
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	8.707784430960775
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	7.909324684501006
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive.	6.556171498396585
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	8.92653761724934
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	3.568262474647173
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues.	8.997591257793436
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	5.362254890267756
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	6.090813435789574
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	6.5954845084729
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	4.994066944583342
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	7.894318016449033
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	8.700532130699921
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	9.610052766548595
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	5.88164475127054
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro.	8.973258340673913
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	5.315803228208993
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	7.487936386517863
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	6.477182549161529
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	8.95796621203668
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	8.080099207719748
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	8.26148155757312
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	5.6724469148595755
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	6.385518825636578
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	12.469279076001692
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	13.225382406950796
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	10.733989739808399
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	7.381204354494779
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	8.897345117242704
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	8.418992335831536
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	7.098124254753714
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	6.976015042099195
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	6.604069265196506
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	6.641768463753216
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	8.71156334171713
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sj√∂stedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	3.704977394224047
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	7.802634289143845
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	7.246922795019959
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	10.425507649720668
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	7.499737057387792
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	5.608098222797511
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	6.946127589318894
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	6.425981828110177
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	7.981701917236886
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	8.537823192628094
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	7.300217444519998
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	7.013999038477724
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	8.763373039137376
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	8.370240919471078
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	9.395352174642133
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	5.757312878569416
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	6.441076105675593
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	7.020824817017844
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	4.3307465563216665
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	7.221117098244958
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	6.830563734651061
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	7.922038050882118
We already have an infrastructure.	10.921955664350984
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	1.2033829553670823
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	8.523895774898437
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	4.763146647206211
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	6.499136324497028
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	10.506350580734532
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	7.957452258001404
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	7.109693383947717
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	8.059299027995817
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.	4.1697243994912405
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	7.1180412442108265
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	6.776439207395421
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	7.478343017517205
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	6.759993335279137
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	7.872193028970965
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	3.3060177387965863
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	6.170917132853653
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	5.661191224668223
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	5.785569168496481
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	6.259479937858553
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	6.101883092998567
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge D√≠ez Elorza, his bodyguard.	6.078951551213728
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	6.915259391063569
Do forgive me.	5.7406518514444524
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	7.235810403165999
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	11.978113748870124
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	7.406749812827383
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	6.514357592129394
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	7.667317329319874
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	6.441117162854976
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	7.0494184637616515
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply.	6.403026164396797
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	6.729808102275938
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	7.325400222412551
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	8.959296571611945
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	7.25668068406672
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	8.837457656999078
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	6.713569042669194
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	4.51675605556394
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	8.31223175719978
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	9.473480547100449
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	7.865659416965133
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	10.689829122150863
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	7.375101792052391
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	6.861998727518552
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	6.990346624731481
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	8.069830652977814
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	5.5682109104429065
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	6.51317459451791
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	7.122472442515638
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	4.80652520484985
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	6.795824053525277
Before the final vote:	14.39841172100134
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	7.36586383424887
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	7.690401989360702
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	8.761553569023503
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	6.6935033072506105
It is not a quota!	28.160872599875695
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	6.607529977475499
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	6.303636855831085
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	6.9923434394506145
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	8.73511831463768
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	5.273453796467486
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	7.311165384845834
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	6.6764492932052075
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	7.323844555704266
This is Angola' s reality.	13.72335681865088
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	8.312306038341774
Both parties were once part of the government.	9.46099441381779
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	7.163699364403823
The figure is now 5.35%.	6.602539632392699
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	10.394580845211754
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	7.031893519112231
I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this.	5.360058160406537
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	4.746096907634437
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	7.02302382661394
When the talks between the SP√ñ and √ñVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FP√ñ for their support.	6.242772361423138
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	8.209923257015348
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	7.184433818640505
I can understand your concern.	4.983370510186238
I will tell you a few things we should do.	8.583958359091342
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	6.07103820991412
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	7.137426988173193
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	7.953883487644489
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	6.836130307282498
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	10.216010472581253
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	7.714075273929024
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	7.313971570178385
The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	12.353031423829437
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	6.78403780612053
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	6.438973439379791
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	7.659904921675008
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	4.2624617932199795
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	6.829771089060608
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	7.667761076247437
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	8.09014764768779
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	7.148213067597732
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	7.565924229387334
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	7.08920680519118
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	7.516686851848199
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	6.534711695967
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	6.944702287430163
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	5.606819633501802
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	6.669443936308317
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	7.251716011690293
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	7.937840063397644
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	8.04829497395762
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	6.69282310654921
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	7.478189653598339
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	6.624271450163488
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	7.520493998226846
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	7.371720843904166
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	8.909030823273929
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	7.521249549485507
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	6.635447386633516
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	7.929109325134631
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	7.8733916835506115
Madam President, the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment.	10.21720076995251
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	10.552805513566284
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	7.025233006526241
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	7.975520682422688
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	7.932905917531605
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	8.113421635339176
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	8.134862778281915
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	5.9814205723555816
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	7.098116135469642
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	2.3297115692328076
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	6.955849624191487
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	8.363792305562429
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	10.08520979209235
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	8.853829199387997
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	6.2229322225719415
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	6.823208925850216
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	8.132304402784069
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	8.095156458950509
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	7.469446376368383
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	6.831202299387399
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	5.935175183137951
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	7.632597359017704
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	8.856581187102814
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	5.741666436177886
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	9.16580047362629
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	6.608077252578854
But this is not in place.	11.044097955208281
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	8.719636513165396
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	7.360315167689272
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	10.841114443710012
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	5.804991929169657
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	6.696283139091126
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	7.837910086805563
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	6.160565466644125
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	6.998645807490009
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	9.277764759125489
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	7.256669890444387
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	8.972225723154542
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	4.213166650665192
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	4.997950921344726
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	6.435903677033794
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	8.829392230078039
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	7.246489748415091
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	5.8592839455601045
The after-shocks can still be felt.	5.994676303084334
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	5.421199210173198
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	8.786155222120575
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	9.66651123987188
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	7.437012255112175
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	6.403494866499926
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	8.876661809451386
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	6.8185930992356205
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FP√ñ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	6.378229191915792
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	9.253196022205131
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	8.540230318280981
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	7.634927955950753
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment.	6.42495890303793
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	6.896151550837837
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	7.511563794544207
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	7.739123197551187
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	5.656427851935958
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	8.57608849590005
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	7.454103472763821
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	9.26966260979885
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	5.137046177443091
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	7.384438658814418
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	8.145608102513638
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	7.76123041391502
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	11.102529885196937
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	6.593416613136352
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	9.106525162188575
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	7.98822975687145
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	6.202357127588641
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	7.787007899342863
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	6.448006874684923
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	6.956869903632755
Mr B√∂sch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	7.435786162812536
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	6.654514056850197
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	7.294333223786293
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	7.654245218228042
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	9.764266477003197
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	7.674732988964168
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	6.31977948195954
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	8.119068370934825
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	1.1438227504289553
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	5.657636930108156
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	8.292581179502568
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	11.177197249020338
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	4.9325197267341565
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	5.6113504637959455
Who is going to pay?	14.164649258249257
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	5.6171219302446636
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:	9.167600500029954
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	7.125868746503863
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	6.581006067179321
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	2.9314548427574594
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	7.608996326604938
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lom√© Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	7.791642907134416
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	7.084780112199826
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	5.705360631605805
We are seeking to implement best practice.	5.897745391237322
It also inspires a few political comments.	9.21181744907733
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	7.193091550850398
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	6.062741121752165
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	6.886336205050614
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	5.048273314595288
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	7.489860385915803
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	8.59762111638733
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	6.985575231027278
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	8.142829360619023
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	8.011410409187324
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	8.322259240366495
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	6.537839614873616
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	8.28966042135595
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	4.701406968618204
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	6.831057142018001
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	6.129541845352053
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	7.853427451903756
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	5.864885730851179
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	11.086924150389143
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	9.128510639272857
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	8.308780326152187
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	8.559527782392898
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	6.79494468568557
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	7.153955748816665
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	6.600048311250954
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	6.214476458453228
I also welcome the Commission's communication.	10.69170274058901
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	6.731092661457788
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	8.38656914038502
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	7.683331508831677
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	9.08404793849324
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	8.069997804524272
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	8.125479992491126
However, we must be realistic.	6.548673477373308
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	6.552949857229646
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions.	8.636598568030024
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	7.518046814513777
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	10.458936261030496
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	8.377050273477316
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	6.342256403410378
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	7.1540605975404254
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	6.557318563010253
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	7.33274113649646
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	6.068128407806938
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	8.593962064263861
This is largely due to historical factors.	3.782730376310683
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	6.2336371596813445
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	3.860195916090272
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	10.014340420775328
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	6.167739739304928
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	7.426892136344378
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	7.232656662271645
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	5.268311215348922
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	8.10174605092409
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	7.126464835133967
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	8.710836121001876
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	7.252034124366631
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	8.05570131021359
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	7.945768178054265
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	6.703502662831677
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	7.223473452461854
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	7.213789336741907
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	11.479277047373621
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	8.478962498838017
This applies to every country.	6.422018423944154
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Berni√© is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	7.4819565811432955
This is the European Union' s declared aim.	8.701530896712836
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	6.734566773641652
The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	5.527836419470108
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	8.246133033010729
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	6.972117554463757
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	7.075011433006512
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	6.1022038701974015
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	9.405203376410295
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	8.577316924982231
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	7.53873189929363
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	6.47072715131347
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	9.476124935706595
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	8.599562421576543
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	11.193689260651192
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	11.809711567078443
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	12.347300879543555
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	8.506462497390016
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	6.80446972718611
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	9.04287522215957
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	6.487564306291285
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	5.819460369420939
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	8.494724056242735
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	8.293517067980078
We should get it into perspective.	6.982680680343635
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	8.880991235674017
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	9.880581603886435
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	6.500894667874081
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	6.16981123164221
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	7.738010700856312
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	8.552033090099714
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	7.681493047125838
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	8.294876159024504
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	7.497273410830079
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	8.922676940642921
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	6.345289573663661
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	6.7941929777482075
But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance.	6.22427375106153
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	6.069156477123784
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	5.9422139231897955
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	7.206309209630344
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	8.161217781948523
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	9.674174383930094
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	7.043828040773912
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	8.906070952220615
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	8.311501278005121
So that is the world as it is today.	8.614636347006957
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	8.244504571015563
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	9.121667683374659
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	7.679758593464057
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	6.058084062390871
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	8.163294398380591
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	9.00373146902256
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	8.351151634855947
In fact, we were shaken by it.	9.769317985483127
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	6.311796927920959
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	6.862463379322243
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	5.962877324631398
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	7.415284856779839
The Lom√© Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lom√© and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	8.228806659265624
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	7.782330761511609
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	9.235492250616481
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	6.660701615411171
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	6.386379680429471
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	5.932467625216306
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	10.471235541174574
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	8.876493787950956
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	5.6976492016934035
That concludes questions to the Council.	2.2676030434178314
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	5.994243157918941
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	7.853328226841275
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	8.566405636396368
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	7.558105266122041
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	7.0204417903213026
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	5.023967598363887
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	7.87058872611009
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	9.914563614605099
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	6.091929757799711
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqu√©, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	7.024679889084796
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	7.865398164730226
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	9.164230445819904
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	6.5579387382111145
It will become totally invisible!	7.806425374407536
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	8.529390008663725
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	8.153495939501918
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	7.772852406680525
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	8.697350517766674
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	8.050349227367882
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	8.241578802629894
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.	6.189830843237248
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	6.753088004097817
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	5.911491027802565
It did this as well.	4.445683825646634
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	7.69424318805443
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	8.418253493641254
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	7.583199054760168
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	6.1227010296139115
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	9.050473645554032
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	7.329342682102666
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	8.123209121374135
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	5.738313152833636
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	6.846204087240067
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	7.762274401763803
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	10.131480138471508
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	9.043575539839884
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	8.412969483800694
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	7.506968105083748
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	6.221066197935087
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	8.634424045913534
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	5.6393201672112925
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	6.428732135418589
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	7.019494608137128
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	6.430606755064384
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	4.904893461864901
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	8.441438341285918
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	6.566371554810674
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	7.468942377099654
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	8.02494886546309
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	5.846308669819472
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will.	6.88664634672251
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	8.759133724924395
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	7.150456909878471
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	11.679869353034048
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	8.663757548486084
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	7.437101735089095
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	6.164945553344699
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	7.596653328800157
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	10.437975248454103
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	7.485786129498502
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	7.324590720376555
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	5.062951938086659
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence.	9.883664174341403
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	8.880332303170977
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	7.832708520064862
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	5.289923306335055
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	5.797080419494444
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	7.669636120316133
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	6.662222012376971
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	7.559193668635779
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	5.048634064031736
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	8.082733060815649
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	8.803601337282018
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	9.715278734579925
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	7.133762061391676
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	5.056415514201546
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	7.483820723701485
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	8.623197134363322
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	6.817153128920973
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	5.679742899386634
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	8.172149907376024
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	7.007303913057118
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	6.23769419824552
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	7.28890519746163
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	7.94787902207733
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	9.107223343522659
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	6.262022756509887
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	5.756543885988783
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	5.336417568808622
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	8.616903513851515
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	6.956350000729267
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	4.387130664597315
It is, in fact, something very positive.	7.8851774445932685
The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	7.807852523271755
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	5.872128889739862
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	8.275595893407699
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	7.993917987665453
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	7.560195066785961
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	7.882556425460923
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	7.860849307086684
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	6.685627091198756
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	6.789883934286683
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	7.455264287721815
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	7.443623721448135
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	6.844981850678255
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	5.475562477904939
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	8.800961480280929
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	7.097935306612004
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	8.174591739986395
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	7.733464846035894
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	6.471735581386738
Why not?	93.61992755357687
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	1.4446187641190105
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	6.799108797166099
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atat√ºrk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.6181224833675003
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	6.162174570144671
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	8.812059933368202
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	5.603110824867548
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.	7.261486568538686
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	5.697067435043728
So let us contact the United States now!	13.547631489104752
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	7.586278072313036
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	6.162875969505902
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	6.975448055436074
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	5.75538606122042
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	8.070687078240153
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	5.59439236761617
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	8.843427764449276
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	8.600177832944349
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	6.886330162656447
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	7.297866081880594
The UN has a peace plan.	7.351265998673665
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	7.578685524049134
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	6.969372656978155
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	8.641238055257922
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	7.226391993483555
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	7.215301267552013
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	3.9675123202944333
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	6.374339111826327
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	7.689486530850293
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	7.8025409154118766
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	7.979443894862152
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	2.3132723337951377
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	6.474684847808997
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	6.349668420218944
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	5.7687309783069045
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	7.1301567536785635
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	7.46751573864925
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	6.491764663472474
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	8.168278319289815
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	5.39613205416186
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	7.157581884213879
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	7.018095107541948
I agree with this request.	17.982439651516692
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	6.147444129951859
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	6.647288539928361
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	5.3786131874978285
However, things are really quite different.	5.838880645771169
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	6.279857542504091
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	8.042912801074744
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	6.510185644217129
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	9.71374795751437
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	7.949836437564216
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	6.11411996526759
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	6.98604059478109
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	6.065223331277625
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	6.707681506046776
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	8.758638968694598
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	5.422470464110105
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	6.743388190653623
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	6.933625874859506
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	5.122649690288183
That would seem odd to me.	5.192218052521793
Is this possible?	6.5127442427262725
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	6.557275974714482
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	8.636865030012201
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	7.459347325545226
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	10.35468584591291
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	4.836382775911947
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	8.086329783412902
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	6.709828389883938
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	8.099119951992067
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	7.434868184192811
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	8.228349239078637
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	5.957130972177385
The situation is badly managed.	10.956907531853238
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	8.316900513956831
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	6.832821217048891
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	7.334834771779952
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	4.697601700511714
Are you aware of this?	11.483330355588322
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	6.908013707146236
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	7.168974904150895
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	5.225787237186344
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	7.394843539646297
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	7.11099244681773
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	8.290639695421046
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	2.553911861667901
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	5.032346532602316
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	8.813902503586759
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	5.54298399826381
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	9.497270086855758
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	6.765205817220384
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	7.632953338071029
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	6.420668916116744
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	6.596154920028299
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	9.178055505029285
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	6.957334292705288
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	7.298934552119324
They must be implemented without delay.	6.616231449557361
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	8.747124276446486
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	4.338542574520087
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	8.663274835749482
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	8.409809597783621
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	12.357368851181729
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	5.601136564545423
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	8.845518221863164
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	7.820143115962689
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	6.524569720608207
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	6.090195176149581
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	6.930130307577148
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	8.200107640243836
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	7.728065548598125
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	8.349060509206586
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	2.6433663137855157
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	7.120166174020856
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	8.420391637946032
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	6.0298845195790225
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	9.070351753546198
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	6.182332080561633
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	7.172842593020789
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	8.242069609546961
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	9.785808285887338
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	7.9636938141382325
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	6.9021320736124006
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SP√ñ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	7.986349594125447
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	5.394201959690324
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	5.817518429068642
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	7.273618690085647
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	8.245733752146812
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	3.530097576796853
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	9.665380525969594
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	6.097964887729335
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	5.360702381491278
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	7.305442517314213
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	7.173411649697434
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	7.984428471756918
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	5.895650857590062
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	7.922377012055732
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	6.76927553761562
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	6.21605631517493
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	5.277919904271138
The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	10.105365563750532
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	5.263507653379473
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	6.176359155623796
We share them.	6.039834785163925
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	7.222527398176896
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	8.242646002701797
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	12.063941264073577
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	11.391297493893303
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	7.854319339848315
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	8.191296015076787
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	6.092983515074406
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schr√∂der blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	7.7112439759779265
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	7.8374872256764725
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.7508188323455256
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	6.478898875044888
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	5.550728648656765
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	10.104468749209369
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	5.820807003123015
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	10.028492722259493
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	5.3090937200197565
They were treated like the worst criminals.	6.336734492988435
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	7.914795619118423
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	8.4303449418888
Is that really authorised?	6.270767193848873
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	8.940056211612012
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	6.048432017354902
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	5.7591857201066725
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	6.4115895210541884
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	5.486140917162612
So again, rhetoric and reality.	2.9132935894673335
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	5.978733130287319
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	8.86428862789354
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	6.214786165167723
You are having to defend a certain Mr Sch√ºssel, you are having to consort with Sch√ºssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	6.697311894629289
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	6.119816029557477
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal.	5.45996225399791
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	8.468221976349996
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	8.519421598222129
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	8.361658728585144
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	7.1283191503138195
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	9.98402843834781
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	7.28744531700818
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	7.258263007213901
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	11.850156335134189
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	8.959606428366564
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	7.425680252362292
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	7.838700383540153
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	7.591969472976535
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	7.298425163424227
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	6.7773829025406025
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	6.421993063242122
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	7.040598633131654
.	52.89722204958655
People are especially wary of GMOs.	4.838203589070833
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	8.639250701248066
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	7.459740760113573
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	8.038764376546668
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	6.435637386785618
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	8.407844044490398
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	7.124695054197529
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	8.518882052714305
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	9.088834737943392
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	7.755745119081739
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	8.323958476416584
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	7.501558325105884
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	3.4670893882236435
We must therefore find a political solution.	9.559118691222443
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	8.128057311248668
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	8.483199836282735
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	4.674035394133474
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	7.9234611147002125
They have a much wider responsibility.	13.379839036201998
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	9.961598448750804
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	7.262130080201753
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	5.70799906008964
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	8.528036406922777
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	5.511652952182891
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	9.606357691005291
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	7.048009422374735
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	9.307993526076944
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	8.860140167590272
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	8.295045294849361
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	6.938540064396142
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	7.674819559830066
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	5.9956663420780725
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	6.699002580610097
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	7.243747004928875
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	10.391344672510806
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	4.057466595710434
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' .	7.378154632104114
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	8.006885969657947
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	6.852559278368599
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	5.799812424240792
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	7.8494531918972985
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	7.108069842181709
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	6.7603040064896645
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	5.222739819011663
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	6.8230187890458485
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	6.1743734167739275
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	7.883121890425142
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	8.023541287455984
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	5.713568603644271
Must there be an IGC?	7.565509944846238
Thank you very much.	5.220335930877271
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	10.46728743053508
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	7.615388866276665
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	7.77307363687318
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	5.932804185017168
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	10.429474331735822
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	8.824775685063235
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	7.8252100050401605
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	7.649088465810626
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	6.8209790891249105
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	6.518794324539389
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	8.121744845109323
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	7.803426136091702
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	10.484011463880105
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	9.122193069041982
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	4.405993740145385
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	6.464205838594747
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	5.129406421443337
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	7.389306173818071
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	6.341439082975403
.	52.89722204958655
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	7.4926252682560595
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	6.97761771220238
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	5.771143032581138
Common fisheries policy	264.27985015435524
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	10.175039929171732
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	6.6638604299413915
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	5.841781427048191
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	7.397325079520534
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	8.05519080523716
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	7.236483590517972
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	4.55708532566207
The next item is the report (A5¬≠0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	3.083379448663656
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	6.872713759470828
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	6.8450945837582395
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	6.902154396773079
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	7.004618982439394
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	6.40119551270413
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	7.640449123643304
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	7.566512914276518
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	6.562319885883862
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	3.4783914459685725
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	6.364075835159941
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	8.598270446570867
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	8.886476197384242
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	7.465428883666886
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	12.998787719993036
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	8.396756763238837
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	6.704920178582231
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	7.048605990589842
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	8.386331560991511
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	8.101700756360222
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	5.035026224689
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	7.1527211568002445
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	6.326929316651466
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	9.039453366702723
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' .	7.785971163877104
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	7.8105790400043915
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	6.301359986712885
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	9.145513326640733
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	7.898839891442034
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	6.362847192824603
On Mrs Isler B√©guin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	6.936156327760848
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	7.477650442873821
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	10.72520548434827
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	7.478758546570747
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	5.743093090786607
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	9.046262014101567
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	7.580477736766853
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	7.406117054068771
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	6.286874516770039
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	8.982258732485608
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	6.914850203442455
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	6.047173107329493
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	5.72430914299586
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	7.881520514825337
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	9.31756621528754
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	7.903921552972438
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	6.189931393474324
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	7.487382139214737
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	6.8143398107738795
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	6.226351981633624
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	5.337640364822584
It is very helpful.	25.02118259439073
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	3.4241393102924826
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	8.792807468020337
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	4.924303234139458
And just as well, in my view.	7.231514844355887
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	5.604931218881298
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	7.712844386413007
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	6.763422743447939
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	6.25596279306598
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	6.661793763354114
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	4.746935445456598
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	7.11400346736029
There is no room for amendments.	16.287171867665567
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	8.10569828469502
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	6.019641786939219
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	7.593362915378763
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	7.0097349448095105
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	8.221213701753296
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.4432914396729326
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	6.693534961469135
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	9.936451937317793
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	5.0638796225865
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	7.135278913914246
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	6.616150574779752
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	5.210666014222378
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	9.163267529192272
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	6.0208109446001
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	5.128389334639239
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	6.146925605157641
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	8.713021592935664
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	5.728942635760691
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	7.565301207286397
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	6.821910648389289
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	7.077122349846243
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	7.758558359431792
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	7.107632440046137
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	8.029609639584715
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	6.348918222015141
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	5.335205980231458
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	9.4669910238876
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	8.444581377696508
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	7.408893603750598
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	4.578119130121963
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	9.096967297783753
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	6.755702166405029
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	8.559919834207227
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	6.605724018342645
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	8.031353165660539
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	10.524960382643616
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	7.236780023040644
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr B√∂ge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	1.8499866237950329
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	9.102494347165734
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	7.787467254489058
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	8.098835448665945
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	6.53886587591254
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	9.225777095482659
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	6.32129493721766
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	6.192119315070928
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	7.546747273560029
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	8.083619282928947
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	11.060545004982796
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	10.687642694677214
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	5.965130329983951
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	9.081910460006325
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	8.293232665298415
The Council?	23.404981888394214
Before the vote:	37.31117233644498
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	6.891647224747594
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	5.543292184251167
.	52.89722204958655
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	9.164706745781816
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	5.610390110066755
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	10.09725628922712
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	8.959845062248363
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	6.021782903841998
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	6.0554905438522795
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	9.650894931510914
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	10.445623327258156
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	6.112847336144255
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	8.060622397443616
I have explained the position of the Commission.	4.534764641526446
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	4.681110984663343
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	7.343739673474308
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	9.551557523755072
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	6.700545894321591
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	9.484076795220156
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	8.470027256615362
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	7.356842731832385
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	8.36308527820679
I visited Do√±ana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	6.311817038460378
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	7.708366416140078
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	9.478511811448627
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	8.299528685086809
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	7.756433919954385
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	7.182567619838091
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	7.273839811941892
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	5.756327520739672
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	6.4647524803986585
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	11.231124481740824
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	7.90568492282033
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	6.365462600100624
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	7.057797150810403
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	6.324832542282695
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	5.244397091145604
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	8.712194651802001
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	7.215039785846135
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	7.606281690024817
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	8.290458006014772
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	7.334306717989572
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	8.508820080246991
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	6.900806819247248
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	7.1504657065669575
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	8.679475955192247
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	8.492699643891397
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	6.851007334064064
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	7.664320458464113
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	6.525469601905696
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	5.313895920133668
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	6.142371871196603
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	6.688755268691488
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	6.5227238483608705
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	6.7608301071167505
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	11.8842512559139
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	7.121673995559809
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	8.149909716325002
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	7.234453961464942
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	8.458515554466464
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	6.948201025966905
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	11.638546793618234
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	9.023214209503427
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	3.9413307094812158
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	11.649506312045034
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	7.823594996205048
I should like to make just a few comments.	8.71090345211267
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	6.198105168914093
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	7.905285717316882
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	6.607929398933731
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	7.151552232482208
They have very little of it.	5.314917004129964
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	8.544348133729885
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	10.803556479343497
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	5.445890376482209
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	9.003284429721143
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	5.568663079640246
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	7.369155808553892
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	5.920871145067732
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	6.818144023683328
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	6.986393228742862
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	5.4330807887293
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	7.528545833897333
I ask for your support.	7.59524834662895
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	7.91055672786891
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.8857071829135577
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	8.490000603789642
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	6.120535506326668
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	7.688439178108405
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	3.8607125198864596
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	7.775419170026916
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	7.483269457983102
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	8.449329320676796
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	7.82994959808398
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo N√∫√±ez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	6.599397955727177
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	2.1492438216687915
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	6.912089853115184
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	10.592019758165295
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	6.881987810242523
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	10.825027397575441
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	6.240006709178794
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	6.090785247513741
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	7.309056075328984
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	8.710051741168197
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	7.573003538970511
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	6.076671344748705
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	6.300795319609201
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	7.889531080194956
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	6.235493730572961
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	7.14118028314174
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	7.252125062605197
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	6.307902641980309
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	7.140435223971216
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	8.245655971803064
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	5.527976797701151
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	6.918273839224496
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	4.2744703050213335
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	11.835610884098005
One example is the use of peat.	10.686104488734552
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	6.228735059719109
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	10.992172466742552
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	6.345749455038691
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	5.613545499175765
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	7.640964726642814
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	6.799799855005695
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	6.8813749511463245
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	8.66605206087691
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	7.576712624085425
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	8.578775193076774
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	5.537102028016237
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	6.0018915456535895
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	7.096345640864686
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	8.861477044884744
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	7.322050392119695
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	8.127778389360564
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	7.673316229925478
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	6.285911932869058
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	5.4821236574368815
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	6.997775271373589
We have thrown water a life-belt.	5.554548970056951
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	8.464398509596677
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	6.371397222007535
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with G√ºnter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	8.37109918180462
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	8.289720514913046
We would like to know their names and their faces.	7.468655688921861
An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary.	6.1708180628353535
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	8.873714405263426
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	6.597721159197434
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	7.785753498773797
The Commission did not do that.	7.371150976954753
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	6.595746936952648
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	6.663512757061101
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	9.059258768271011
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	7.5825869026172725
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	6.400842748223895
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	8.561990129786363
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	7.546864264529224
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	6.065043284584111
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	7.126677760875725
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	6.696704702499594
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	7.184854639442801
We should not be too masochistic.	11.099899931439873
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	7.95955222939538
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	5.258488697106016
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	7.97118555908418
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	9.699370749624967
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	7.724851509117719
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	7.742392971055974
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	8.268329600125488
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	7.16364919378945
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	5.679569740751474
Will it do the same to us?	7.325994134378146
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	7.476788808892079
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	7.574337409157099
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	10.31655402602412
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	7.55772670825116
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	8.816994022878992
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	6.9103784608573156
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	8.818304585018996
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	1.2264779583237335
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	10.329165198963754
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	6.059146889733791
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	8.636718281640464
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	8.174655023008123
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	7.688362991000551
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	6.824747920147852
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	2.3915613478229814
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	6.521847670673915
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	8.032415814047761
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	9.541374408910263
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	6.334640785557019
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	6.359819403868203
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	5.88973509535878
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	7.1092058613175775
I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	8.123680511459186
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	7.710629522110576
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	7.845063700783433
Transport of dangerous goods by road	1.2213453195107076
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	9.313020845970648
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	7.472094000080666
Quite simply there is no question of this.	4.903537798801962
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	7.817982258052317
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	6.539970089363075
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	7.388391024752943
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	7.594978330213672
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	9.007833754736339
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	5.804487569059386
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	7.6411653696202455
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	7.627039575774697
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	4.711701079114643
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	6.622318022268223
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	6.996143828114532
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	6.848332548355437
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	5.396137579656225
We vigorously supported the Troika d√©marche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	7.470793438292295
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	4.806851851261245
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	6.578371262740031
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	8.16119234679491
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	7.28775776041433
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	8.192495635512632
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	6.899453665904386
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	8.54388928804438
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	4.4828126849055705
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	8.826105477658329
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	7.10265654297428
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	9.237284562178036
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.3888185805878668
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	7.583595340897803
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	7.156005562483743
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	7.972772280937778
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	2.077495277818969
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	6.972692710502955
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	5.000759364626628
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	7.499418116202122
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	6.616706969757669
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	10.043625502586474
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almer√≠a should have been foreseen.	6.41126940299522
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	5.785578224173726
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	7.466646230098932
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	8.533876494942836
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	7.506004013225809
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	6.760210950631437
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.3146471262555792
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	7.029454068194052
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	7.923202696107669
Yet this is not the situation.	12.79078333922281
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	8.226361416608867
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	8.752505398313689
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	8.227418290018218
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	6.391610611549716
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	7.8385614183980366
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	11.368493522587142
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	7.569516731339013
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	7.5213909829542995
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	6.884312694401025
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	9.211590666923541
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	10.63420182098691
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	6.321428260252973
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	3.718900798861391
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	6.8835537019739865
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	7.7097173354861175
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	8.785026061694012
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	7.414615537693345
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	1.162056305492263
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	7.786574262280449
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	4.5084055314730636
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	7.977246928185229
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	6.216915662133797
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	7.333309841658917
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	14.6294296335041
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	10.09459156615674
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	7.347806702292535
We should not be so politically partisan.	8.208053754952344
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	5.660935561133711
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	11.735467125980538
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	6.650544033091242
Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	7.488811221328299
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	7.3128870015761125
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	6.218855799343925
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	9.02479430181306
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	7.831579140883401
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	6.683657454096165
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	8.374350129105169
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	7.657097582045098
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	9.52357084624713
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	8.791697785815385
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	6.7501934840254165
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	8.441166092454605
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	8.051034878011798
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	7.370825251340328
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	8.57829668532554
First Part	46.285069293388226
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	7.179735705892444
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	7.475352722837623
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	6.206568635373224
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	7.206431126397458
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	6.291804086385546
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	9.645071168125634
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	8.015730470448048
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	5.610774983098113
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	6.829800891008519
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	7.912386090095802
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	4.363172031184272
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	7.635627948505712
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	7.75075411403288
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	5.763922798628197
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	7.267722272358147
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	5.840043996308218
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	9.185181604957823
It is clear that is not acceptable.	12.408608928342257
Welcome	14.22659668727896
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	6.863176355650981
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	9.4416478094681
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	7.989588354273616
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	5.30931817175394
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	7.881324184039554
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	4.436970242556536
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	5.947241722625373
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	7.3722449856469705
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	8.273134884045888
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	9.81260006903653
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	6.906065435099023
But seriously.	84.09922128608918
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	8.239609976648428
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3165503112335124
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	7.126846727834206
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	5.277303728160526
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	8.316535926979292
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	8.031249153341525
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	6.988387750379541
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	11.405616314806968
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	9.072555274694789
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	9.372887663339167
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	8.379363535986423
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	8.043358750747357
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	7.70983601024221
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	8.041495310321801
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	6.096197408366572
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	5.575653508947978
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	7.268934627921193
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	7.1928297464272
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	4.9820828954021055
We will talk about this on another day.	4.741439269267741
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	8.911803038232254
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	8.266441010926089
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	7.217835758200702
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	7.954431513880421
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	6.764783833348201
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	8.161382775245324
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	6.448189493420653
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	6.790728577997267
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	8.38442765849442
Natural habitats were destroyed.	3.944592103678289
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	4.680995112049735
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	7.789593807257838
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	9.221864900749102
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	8.382294606783127
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	7.536907461194994
The first is greater transparency.	16.120376190420767
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	5.991908460532982
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	7.3846634106267155
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	8.717348693363768
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	7.338225344446996
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	7.597893591007281
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	7.186053713989018
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	7.995127123126019
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	5.4877990659058105
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	6.4309339216567185
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	8.685981735567706
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	6.811882212478574
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	12.467636425345058
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	7.108407735219084
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.7467434016318433
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	7.470715686314579
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	3.035534540332799
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	7.125784770297267
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	7.035627768562318
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	7.118034430800987
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	4.343897699107384
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	7.280770824443835
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	9.029746101254558
If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	5.840379383738649
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	8.044560771914089
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	7.67730122706924
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	7.70031150245043
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	6.823270381103533
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	7.094202821955366
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	10.168450183471343
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	9.86351301096237
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	6.541169826969696
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	7.299276131489263
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	10.832297715738832
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	7.487584735167321
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.228807506750262
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	7.985227057520962
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	5.692999603927028
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	9.791822566688223
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	7.095358206236737
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	6.954065502139044
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	7.509574444617821
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	5.097134304282302
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	6.237667428502019
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	7.216287542794218
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	5.605711068486733
Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschi√∂ld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC))	3.8307779078666364
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	6.92237130411831
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	5.7423303684570834
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	7.978973355928823
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	8.502559447583845
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	12.103304026885898
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	6.823523604919551
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	1.7605129839285136
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	6.0546362726417975
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	8.642223007364866
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	9.063592653752202
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	6.395128940543392
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	9.072241225462506
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	7.397965805825764
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	8.212871348348271
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda.	9.717025577866556
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	7.669299578924923
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	6.370637296431984
They see us restricting each other's liberties.	5.662042258315446
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	7.723478022618206
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	7.019206454288098
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	7.241391042787072
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	12.165293176257995
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	8.465456109288178
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	10.002844178423368
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	6.516354628851791
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	8.150110231254367
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	6.31773515634612
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	5.2057154472558125
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	7.612851239386043
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	6.493586011806227
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	6.220387696818595
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	7.410047816158235
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	5.93663726457187
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	7.355397528118078
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	5.9499364645496815
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	6.381369563766013
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	7.797588975567339
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	9.038433175068002
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	6.716672274025537
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	3.3924397327492852
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	7.090787810265658
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	7.646729940445937
We need to match this vision with reality.	11.499939677130328
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	7.690335605437148
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	6.167768162410444
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	7.667316299663062
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	6.732204691715642
So we must practise selective fishing.	7.208393293617711
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	7.349672044739911
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	6.578162822681401
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	6.891098018223599
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	7.511934116972351
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	8.216212999176745
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	7.821527084943797
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	8.211649458016478
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	6.988879329852376
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	9.333641827578832
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	6.341432575258254
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	6.620542035258115
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	8.328057992182229
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	6.514947405162259
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	6.584875550908981
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	6.972543537203831
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	8.598622582742118
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	7.079346431835404
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	10.65625044823221
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	6.955877239919602
We are to know who is on each committee.	10.942160551704305
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Rom√°n too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	6.895734558482915
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	6.301802586956859
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	6.210493570931022
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	4.728803869893497
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	6.43590874386924
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	7.451874610578507
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	8.740381928022343
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	5.998976476204065
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	7.08407476023818
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	7.274765714861209
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	9.268061740651321
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	8.691316945290135
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	4.124065792123713
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	6.013281990464924
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourri√®re, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	5.778700607128526
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	9.187971452375308
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	7.041517068975829
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	5.680837572865113
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	9.063172113139274
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	1.9673049209712643
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	9.00861571975752
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	8.538936344088041
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	7.362339225536652
This is part of the solution.	5.302728997802964
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	6.629117766606489
My apologies once again for my mistake.	6.800812260333951
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	5.609536634764599
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	9.592868621507005
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	6.762236654096048
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	6.720899545798088
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	7.595557641755438
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	5.168577993981194
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	6.537082229810211
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	7.917700391077807
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	9.431760518422875
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	7.598199715576616
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	7.477123753904969
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	6.176258839748099
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	7.866101614001721
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	8.719992467992652
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.	8.481138423237255
The first is asylum.	23.538600298327815
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	7.873264250434536
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	6.6853022382656535
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	6.548767982339453
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	11.354846361383942
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	7.24878928062702
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	7.854754412208385
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	5.292634094224738
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	6.962416554352378
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	7.219248952831879
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	8.762444656400987
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	8.28840153058751
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	6.94250005453031
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	7.2137161536281456
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	7.968108937697097
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	6.4306905832057515
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	6.997929902437811
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	8.209516893891772
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	5.991379739918724
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	9.054584534040597
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	9.076091115236663
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	7.0952990453348725
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	7.115872772117643
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	9.220553735861726
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	7.109934358422049
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	7.986221671853095
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	7.941243681173783
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	8.177816717298363
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	4.29466088622522
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	8.29603169969279
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	6.944425533539364
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	4.997344657274911
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	9.423587769075583
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	8.5774984301766
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	6.030637927989217
We cannot afford to wait.	3.7817573373198603
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	8.002712577638286
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	8.027650302952367
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	6.337002064106569
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	8.06597344913896
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	8.976243986749433
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	4.470201530118916
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	6.060009859357075
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	9.232901033066359
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	7.42005565946436
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	7.675524778264304
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	7.3549761961643725
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	7.886874155977097
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	9.058992080845684
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	5.280881214975008
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	12.20502361696318
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	11.207820619947507
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	9.772867525336725
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	7.650801626322271
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	8.179207188436335
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	7.1837747525456335
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	7.0664762658481415
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	5.718236044000313
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	6.622345267947724
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	6.960598308440357
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	5.789268624619755
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	6.915105758084419
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	7.919478330097389
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	5.7825032877998215
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	7.03693226982794
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	6.068223163722405
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	5.897568081427788
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	9.700964130910267
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	9.532953583459959
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	9.900663086102636
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	6.942008677401996
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	7.636382639088689
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	7.347049946560186
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	5.397812757239345
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	7.547646036181171
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	7.406218066927472
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	6.941135454463435
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	7.562330838116647
We want to encourage debate among the people.	10.304158706953192
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	5.427922732414403
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	6.316261469019092
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	5.91305417029494
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	6.383401234138813
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	7.8208336050748715
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	7.421495867904481
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	7.470748382411623
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	6.786076087399771
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	9.12579770998529
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	7.716976609372273
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	7.760317067218235
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	5.118681836029731
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	9.564473169362623
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	7.492222807031131
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	9.646893069355405
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	7.749096222119305
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	7.029863956581539
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	6.953140846744755
No, it does not!	14.20802187484977
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	5.9344367639806865
Not at all.	2.765077952195592
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	7.892597837973701
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	6.945433097615
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	7.424845814724666
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	6.3108258682245895
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.977433190412669
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	6.711349769900709
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	13.53433104688787
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	8.615046022538397
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	6.88630904456154
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	8.49947404849217
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	6.06199248925682
This applies to them and us.	11.4248706421712
They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	6.60418238663049
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	9.260344609574737
Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186(COS))	4.752598128848505
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))	2.4488176869575056
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	9.177233688910905
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	6.964077032885971
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	6.800305177433843
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	6.19485504834067
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.378509133752049
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	8.142162347228451
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	8.272899679770559
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	7.444683041385165
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	7.73163144514608
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	7.113668679484677
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	6.035786933923974
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	5.640966071786565
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	5.287389059890194
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	6.248002270308336
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	6.778601920902061
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	6.608396639173942
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	7.784579411959023
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	7.309618072830796
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	8.24355854467111
That is the measure of the problem.	13.359597079576435
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	2.314521316781661
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	5.170062266432157
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	6.274438854031943
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	7.6437529044684185
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	8.185134371937128
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	6.957626406174911
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	8.42695310871223
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	7.301082569302018
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	7.184660216046502
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	6.558388491464702
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	5.927788400676521
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	7.469086907509028
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	12.190190008902837
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	7.4092670280429695
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	7.533771903995889
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	6.210504737094631
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	10.25391820988307
But what then instead?	5.136595237883328
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	23.284908753229214
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	5.588111098914372
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	7.7006477584420825
Secondly, Cuba.	4.216582756715715
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	9.323148088672248
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	7.7724171318149065
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	5.8853246450370875
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	5.967705840002454
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	7.897715648006067
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	8.792104912739637
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	8.541526350412905
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	6.487325308100872
Agenda	14.22659668727896
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	9.170631306637727
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	4.446698865001394
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	7.769920381156196
I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	9.318491116513833
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	10.098608774678214
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a T√úV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	7.048470281358212
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	6.518805310613793
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	7.3720262503514755
So what is the European Union doing about it?	9.864258899408947
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	4.974629065077064
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	7.509724121883761
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	7.544879439068867
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	7.425464195879363
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	3.342591187092415
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	5.163301885148335
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	6.839420060557569
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	7.377032336131221
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	7.902699138874719
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	6.067281150937986
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	13.242784423069686
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	9.19404280326454
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	5.7727655276929095
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	7.806079221517073
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	7.891510427328334
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	8.001346279643952
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	6.532869060424704
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	8.604625086937125
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	9.237210979011735
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	7.337206508093888
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	6.819809567306332
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	5.87165846599647
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	7.2227388836919255
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	8.094867723800737
The same applies to European air traffic control.	6.300626340267848
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	7.614150115573026
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	9.249488691763744
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	7.765678550526465
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	9.129620287585745
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	6.2878032638578185
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	6.736936416998216
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	7.2993457722109705
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	8.248520189829188
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	6.484823065465482
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	6.944910778132966
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	5.3356578172216445
We must therefore act.	7.703260521168059
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	16.908333246907116
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	9.448906093191376
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	8.065471127311069
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	7.720361808459359
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	8.18002353312474
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	6.648917406917616
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	7.590557416547033
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	8.15605211224547
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	7.158581319235959
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	5.2088568799715365
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	8.969630687144358
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	7.238683239350881
My third point has also been mentioned already.	4.860285079484741
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	5.960390807416387
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	6.404157772099622
I find the opposite the case.	8.014043310058264
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	7.531279150712699
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	9.503964451327379
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	8.132089656578763
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	6.901744056701819
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	7.111631599113125
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	9.186536053932224
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	4.879583721757967
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	8.028334684454705
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	6.921146905809434
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	7.664297611147966
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	8.992878909155955
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	5.449118196825588
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	6.734794266806946
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	7.451329677803312
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	8.398877350901053
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	5.295643157795811
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	5.629955058733045
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	6.216656555867493
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	8.450334504590183
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	4.568520349558739
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	7.494393794083964
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	5.196575403345203
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	9.561015929599819
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	7.427017918696547
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	7.1324462154302015
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies.	7.7822319196292495
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	9.046500249788085
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	8.236401649662021
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	4.520274596838983
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	7.643388230481607
Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	6.47161763237784
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	8.095588776403567
Why do I say that culture is important?	11.809651895886784
Some Members have even come out against this.	8.879480155469466
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	6.583069360617682
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	7.055181175505182
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	5.319844595186895
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	6.558248830624541
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	9.420393925205396
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	6.134205319746003
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	7.952583943700046
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	8.042755240250441
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	10.883377701137743
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	8.53265445280729
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	4.408195832867122
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	7.084021878543456
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	7.999310292012839
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	7.07127921025583
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	5.447199678582594
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	3.655734870266972
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	7.5808196347434915
However, that is not the problem.	13.243014811222794
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	7.447168420193158
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	8.117616840197618
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.	7.568898446292749
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	6.764324458863947
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	7.541567522665371
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	6.9241407596339295
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	6.894467737765595
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	8.300449798872492
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	7.5238199076989565
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	5.984617423880598
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	8.644714758852771
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	6.765282446748285
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	10.850844593798113
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	7.173238595426568
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	8.310526108408368
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	8.274614975740294
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	7.428892904194183
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	6.9479250632826535
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	8.50812243227585
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	8.219635712055876
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))	1.9434100164680714
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	8.912142733980197
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	9.42470396275438
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	9.151748761236346
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	8.458321283591948
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	6.232556761809386
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	9.702388363599006
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	7.691098986374696
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	8.06945648853604
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	5.977998152768633
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	8.646803200345321
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	9.131328913297382
The newspaper reports were misleading.	5.6035278478340755
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	7.083312697266073
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	6.5918319560886
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	6.288707148300505
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	9.393249041012513
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	6.317579911643282
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	6.8674155130830705
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	7.786764287663601
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	10.988361939008024
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	5.487647076962134
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	6.631026238245597
We must meet these challenges together.	6.561471132527038
After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	8.295966799183743
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	8.269393029264647
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	8.030599244570531
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	5.916726607877152
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	6.468209168917125
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	6.396805712495365
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	9.330496690557602
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realit√©.	7.134147518710913
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	7.1906705483575255
Mr President, Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	9.026228006203963
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	7.26718517360029
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	7.870657035912113
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	7.847153550474641
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	7.329943015750912
The directive remains in place.	3.8434054372890483
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	8.15529422724533
Agenda	14.22659668727896
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	7.473564079036132
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	5.808019888269383
Decourri√®re report (A5-0028/2000)	1.162056305492263
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	5.753504545385579
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?	9.052178027660858
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	9.33112160918102
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	6.806129602908027
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	7.372217303632768
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	9.461088716684749
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	8.37967524602521
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	9.638066881846836
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	4.3664225478988
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	5.495112186384129
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	7.283586743492157
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	8.23093941994958
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	7.996189434247266
We have a new Commission.	16.717444744593664
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	6.531156161093637
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	8.064610859601185
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	6.8076424296630496
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	5.1713408728420935
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FP√ñ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	7.4261842212492315
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	6.588409611579332
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	8.863756491232191
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	8.45458504610322
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	9.248525913494285
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	6.9259878469551115
That is very much the right approach.	7.325057111830469
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	11.559620818648998
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	7.1848043347800985
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	6.5162434730049466
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	7.5314998363925145
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	8.211065516470072
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	7.822604682958914
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	8.218100351793037
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	7.908800403098326
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	7.755429789945565
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	6.127100957689401
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	7.471664311547067
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	5.470815822163287
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	6.638213208698657
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	5.941026131483381
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	8.22633579430715
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	5.189445009471021
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	7.246603637328401
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	8.13332089015253
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	11.562884639803404
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	7.935069443546574
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	4.558462687600396
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	5.234144743446406
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	7.330180762197131
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	8.278460124391641
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	7.513625160269261
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	8.579209447675982
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	6.768760922323072
I believe we can learn something from this.	8.204364478781265
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	7.582502336094705
Let us look at some of these reasons.	10.287716649542096
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	8.259871178356418
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	6.95345225196388
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	6.759633720357835
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	7.2044662037024745
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	8.537147148108463
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	8.827824651012456
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	8.14570113942994
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	7.714517879220559
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	4.1575335806605604
The latter element continues to be the Commission' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	8.816879042210266
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	5.514870815126055
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	7.663834762428579
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	7.369493671602946
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	9.221636075372198
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	7.33093543250478
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	7.098120405850507
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative.	7.45825886068737
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	4.94035223461286
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	8.425947228563873
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	6.944895995095655
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	8.66662430942932
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	7.414001081866153
Current programmes must be accelerated.	4.756472183664175
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	9.633447940234563
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	11.504028782630117
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	8.727323681357563
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	6.438383504262854
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	7.236979765220833
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	8.544009597037606
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	10.682772077895894
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	6.414632544261923
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	7.698856270109491
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	6.2293167521436486
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	7.078083376828449
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	6.604736509032014
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	6.929391572955905
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	7.360416769641739
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	10.604125099889272
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	8.804506612030334
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	5.739317896143665
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	7.570609306501082
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	11.185729491174362
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	8.143237852748625
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	11.011961387210587
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	6.539336657331583
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	9.201456724072916
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	6.833794227637166
We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	7.192977525758602
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	6.485994169156348
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	7.630873003263411
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	8.415460347289272
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	9.131961760385067
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	8.086836408442165
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	8.175939388253699
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	6.633254058535904
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	9.018227125462865
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	2.4413650981368407
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	8.15529594434818
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	10.063902512981272
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	6.599219594326538
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	7.25829526002184
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	8.36010140155822
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschi√∂ld' s report.	6.206437658658845
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	6.610598651212965
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	8.849922264936664
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	7.6278289774897
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	8.668142432650042
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	8.655695483744122
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	4.49851944623376
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	7.115338106356154
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.	8.62959384589613
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	8.144007709755819
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	8.004476804263652
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	7.559073051802927
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	6.8610123046740235
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	8.61459275962608
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	8.103400341761041
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	9.211850314657683
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	6.619951813412691
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	8.274301049441204
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	5.6418673982212315
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' .	6.518069174617955
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	5.1236159701967905
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	7.673546689048955
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	9.476246788301506
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	6.047642521975348
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	10.957048230480687
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	11.133931544888402
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	4.658331027752825
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	9.451773797864888
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	7.98731822343661
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	7.750945031537864
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	11.543901936628577
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	5.289636872019639
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	6.03420313967178
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	7.853988926891109
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	7.559525842248582
The European Union voted against that motion.	23.5211695710328
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	8.140623030136886
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	6.50404146459381
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	9.003392898872118
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	8.339545414550887
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	7.167478510402666
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	7.559129979369046
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	8.18902089998661
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	7.06620443149288
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	9.045716801898914
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	8.402285266668418
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	4.865154637304672
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	11.967972892208286
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	8.381090567006634
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	7.892655708582018
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	6.995253094221039
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	7.19760648098234
So we need to do this.	5.204354240376507
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	7.655786488041158
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	6.395456443299349
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	7.724967476080765
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	8.605266581239501
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	6.954167147728303
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	7.831069659900579
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	8.04978079601573
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	8.662765414096707
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	7.399588362700441
The results are certainly not what we expected.	9.209399875672352
The Commission?	23.404981888394214
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	6.643234864844932
This is the Commission' s own survey.	10.581554426628491
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	8.370897733712738
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	7.762952691905437
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	8.355300154844118
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	9.428034416221315
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	5.435370213783201
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	6.375145287579248
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	8.243091711575646
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	8.11672392345501
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	7.187209060275874
That is a more reasonable system.	15.283627827296918
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	8.672198721184788
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	6.447787855592575
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	10.433839428910984
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	6.245527773762088
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	6.597084910080402
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	10.343913620271678
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	9.309337354781265
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	5.490164742592033
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	7.087351787726566
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	7.268704379842456
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	6.642459225782737
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	7.821368390303304
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	7.588222313063454
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	6.332215305774691
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	7.073885793679053
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	6.9831738738602525
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	8.3499471404013
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	6.995037121385729
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	8.054416368654726
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	7.419482804079512
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	5.383724878273598
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	11.27597421316485
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	6.511901245330228
That is where the potential is.	6.6752465209821406
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	4.118615008311722
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	7.653275257213058
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	8.140501173090778
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	7.386331777855278
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	9.568433011132534
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	7.205534591713487
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	8.6893979819829
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	7.455534478751872
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	7.8704679180499575
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	8.568559858563232
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	8.068862671474413
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	6.913082507132428
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	7.815440781528536
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	7.433183039069543
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	5.231858097710995
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	8.393312933670453
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	8.057485700711078
People must realise this!	3.662784465183807
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	6.049862355001354
While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	6.491211565569168
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	5.607321221809383
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	9.213925790005602
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	8.407321239977504
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	6.707115228466855
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	11.167255984687362
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	8.365926152626095
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	8.657199141716239
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	7.20322755705334
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	8.027325552853254
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	1.3756781393037838
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	7.784065920158039
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	8.099253553968694
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	6.328417089159704
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	8.285871306336272
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	7.897404878567207
(Parliament approved the request)	6.948545979084922
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	7.322839112342326
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	3.8572960465639974
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.	5.9752003060993575
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	9.316440775662299
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	6.446942315786463
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	6.751731856007944
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	7.420927459474072
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	7.68182535235157
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lom√© Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	7.430147809003202
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	8.32452621467683
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	6.075257911836835
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	7.7390009566375975
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	7.336426356627591
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	6.879758141746619
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	6.700406760115414
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	7.909182668994104
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	6.854672665245218
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	7.133677117931515
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	5.183218538366244
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	8.240623157885869
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	7.788781168373333
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	6.3517363112919645
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	7.254822096981542
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	11.832395259575428
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	9.180890678473242
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	8.558168171089722
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	6.996440863944939
It is a highly complex problem.	20.043001936216942
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	5.901748822868298
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	10.549615479685595
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	6.51939230227681
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	7.078820968607228
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	7.511080114710315
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	4.894041862068423
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	6.468338465444738
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	9.479196089639553
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	6.829923616673255
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	5.887393809789739
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	10.95111296268066
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	5.86306659782021
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	9.385735568838802
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	8.39526007478935
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	10.264397047598624
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	8.87448594408903
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role.	7.84923474430147
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	6.811003891927888
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	10.345960885364835
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	8.163261625075688
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	6.657777073976697
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	7.090849687541698
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	4.215351334827263
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	7.033903914950942
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	6.679109584076461
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	7.826796179105155
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	5.884959064053191
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	8.68325614460589
Even in the tourism industry.	19.095875040868812
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	5.788388260094672
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	7.396184711483923
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	6.851970233116978
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	7.432189605814963
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	7.560001496592858
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	6.4960540847163335
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	8.07154427468315
There must be an overriding economic interest.	8.145457732570865
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	8.56585552733593
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	4.825758780424459
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	8.125949690070994
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	5.3875848754227365
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	6.769618555649602
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	2.416544998320655
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	7.164096753220758
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	9.009634370980947
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU' s treaty concerning the manufacturer' s liability.	6.090701989272047
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	7.0675172498134495
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	8.766892592658136
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	6.1614408040098345
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	6.371685555817019
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	6.473715346296833
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	9.40012083678973
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	6.054539275488326
I understand what you are saying.	10.980236148465538
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	6.111208394863936
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	6.465895059327527
The party led by Fran√ßois Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal P√©tain' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students' mutual insurance company.	7.8227831987997005
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	6.933200902496152
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	8.292887856886452
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	11.721835565450023
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	7.1256209636435575
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	7.152336841149382
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	7.96166368174296
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	7.29983746047842
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	8.68434015514485
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	6.984072963045672
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	5.204218233877388
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	6.74740257261754
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	8.743084920903238
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	6.743206836848521
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	4.092209156692734
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	8.7793484653675
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	7.080324308182595
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	7.995975829838026
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	8.238945644588833
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	6.5830226885597805
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	7.314895670898102
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	5.513353268114905
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	4.303973003001967
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	5.157563845321674
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	6.302482372518693
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	5.857889085184985
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	11.73033541313111
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	5.778977158613905
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	5.876929331144191
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee.	6.649642391955826
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	5.826462157876683
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	7.717851377682799
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	6.3131044954726026
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	12.015379691781137
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal.	6.998274534177954
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	9.798964338470896
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	6.0895800529768636
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	8.085502187461302
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	7.085511890931671
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	1.1438227504289553
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	7.028008026848454
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	5.9789211503637665
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	9.089852892220902
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	6.1854030905907775
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	7.049336566794382
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	8.05827218051927
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	8.820125922011341
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	8.062727397122018
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	7.950228493123721
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	6.471723421337313
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	9.810398456555282
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	9.838144552649611
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	2.0457455543214076
As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth.	8.188263910411438
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	7.824923694148091
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	8.071749818662632
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	7.45839105765271
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	10.03006933986382
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	8.014446458567463
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	6.170841587211968
They have all been persuaded!	4.7851380756683115
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	6.822972339880812
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	10.145005234194093
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	5.950526459902609
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	7.3012419677872025
Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	7.348558047360097
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	8.60344606759098
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.	5.910196872344638
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	9.057681824213578
) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	6.807182857498291
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	9.573544268513919
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	7.795553949078729
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	4.151452883131365
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	8.009884578728215
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	7.120939585693937
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.	7.775468386915081
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	8.35999020055236
I agree completely.	2.7321503267681733
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	8.086299100438756
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	7.154694307722356
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	6.284617084980713
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	6.198810220328922
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	7.429482717080836
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	6.841767691884829
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	8.675303089203945
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	6.2819841250885
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	4.192414937847817
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	12.04245513499235
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	5.045089511110174
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	9.441877934675095
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	8.31184391110817
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.158750264835313
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	7.245091824103245
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	4.7892360776352945
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	6.189612906033742
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	6.335712680857854
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	8.679474485596137
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	7.566537221053206
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	5.171100318523151
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	6.004784367690869
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	6.5283434492127865
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	6.8495329796898625
This is in place too.	16.9096224524716
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	7.792113255006234
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	6.45500867166599
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	7.741172873369118
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	8.426380421308501
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	7.683471250540962
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	8.66992631677553
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	6.7694392299282775
First of all: who should pay?	16.238626162846753
Resumption of the session	1.9337498405317024
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	8.383789542988035
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	8.782050592481648
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	7.6981441274091384
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	8.396529087929652
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	7.573869619618838
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	8.160494563033627
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	9.434600762738887
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	7.350965570223436
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	6.005496141616161
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	11.87777036279673
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council.	7.647428217805785
It was natural that these √©lites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	6.1001197762912245
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	7.014026491525925
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	8.580110323635767
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000.	7.533427846651883
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	8.633575109594931
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	6.772165528963191
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	7.624900510349525
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	7.919108413405459
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	6.350431029256284
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	8.517937769467926
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	6.896281639582026
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	8.42462502707238
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	8.91304576775536
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	6.569128941190866
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	7.7181531880476255
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	4.018906076489544
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	7.5092520429623
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	7.091709745298365
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	7.772444220437075
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	7.383217404063922
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	8.11459642296011
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	8.478771799268506
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	7.601213080583535
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	8.164470563087514
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	8.014111884917344
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	6.380627815143437
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	11.978982523633373
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	8.719645642790999
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	8.222116328725175
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	7.118947493549765
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	10.305155446351751
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	9.647961071130874
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	7.114398044975444
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	7.509760312717126
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	8.336085307596303
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	8.149999383360699
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	6.141884235509621
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	7.398840923095755
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	5.705929774117167
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	7.7476610361045495
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	8.192749072029693
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	3.1668251473117888
In this respect, we support Libya' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	7.313794636867003
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	6.430343752626216
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	8.973447066279238
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	7.921357588551877
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	8.434500973652497
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	8.88479822369556
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	3.723941044177095
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	7.213142168761459
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	7.6159479104271215
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	8.006669527385684
J√∂rg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FP√ñ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	7.392822026474925
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	6.906643473527662
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	6.372067541098181
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	3.4602009543803147
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	6.589555945553041
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	7.9967614190834215
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	7.725547672872578
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	8.77243706295949
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	10.758250976410272
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	5.376519528960157
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies.	6.13548990665192
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	6.383386307441559
Europe is a community of law.	10.403639165846322
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	6.655691899248451
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	6.744884663516563
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	9.489796425412008
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	7.699245399791741
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	7.496213202734354
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	6.396660237888974
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	7.574604000130106
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	8.970999074288864
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.479028927468749
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	5.559110226888329
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	6.604945281926805
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	6.605692223101786
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	7.491713804358998
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	7.351730113086648
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	6.760361194850438
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	7.146851480772018
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	7.68514184182356
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	7.859436085928526
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	6.216471216503923
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	6.674465170413593
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	9.703557476414195
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	7.24473624606295
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	6.219390287572984
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	8.030686603173448
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	9.783356824203064
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	7.683951038655304
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	6.807682869138648
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	5.894181127409313
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	7.451589067556038
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	5.513274622613513
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	7.317817025117162
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	8.183426885393587
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	9.23650881523951
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	5.507087040009558
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	7.376822542001099
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	10.582709157964315
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	7.7376741791061345
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	7.184747147588453
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	6.977173885209229
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	7.365363385278482
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	2.72060284779001
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	7.3423299269094855
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	6.114946481070231
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	7.290460738941999
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	6.672870387582955
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	6.863194062046848
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	8.145492057876643
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	3.3659441139558766
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	9.671268098555156
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.6310157425517084
Please excuse this very legal answer.	5.4752008604100055
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	6.70376706791531
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	7.738188852138584
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy.	5.196876406304155
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	12.026185780159416
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	8.72681384648702
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	9.5467461379911
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	7.748834515911506
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	5.801844420612278
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	5.295126245213342
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	8.589400123899958
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	7.964315005077282
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	7.5635413584535724
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	8.757970497714641
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	5.943375286991461
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	10.504423387448147
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	7.4482559632838
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	5.999398739364374
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	7.902992526141502
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	10.290277135135536
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	1.815253888452406
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	10.746640692286412
I salute Mr Schmidt.	5.438711816289208
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	7.249233290158726
This argument is therefore not relevant.	7.747790901493278
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	7.176034701429413
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	7.586845813792749
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	8.76803670247249
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	7.493557259643237
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	6.511494857889519
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	6.46674199689373
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	6.714838317789069
In response I can only say that this already exists.	7.7770851618610735
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	8.92055565587813
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	5.650101966664485
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	7.624493399521172
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	6.533097308109182
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	8.260430827934782
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	11.710371435429526
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	6.368578122873487
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	12.117069576243297
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	6.683362090528631
The nature of the EU has not changed.	13.342061023929993
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	7.47046919839107
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	6.47917718582823
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	10.608923254026053
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	12.024342711245023
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	8.196076209073697
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	8.411357440296745
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	8.50531378046274
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	5.562451366903274
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	7.313275600294595
The European Union is a system based on law.	9.772780586281199
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	9.582877911962141
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	6.7201677932558965
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	142.34971391378988
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	8.123337685052162
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	12.056486699317503
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	5.719921312001931
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	8.003087187585994
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	8.862862667586302
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	7.19363385293201
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	6.713603209825006
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	6.93096645435347
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	5.806205607851684
I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	9.749134983498411
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	5.454534853327693
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	6.161744610428787
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	7.30232049924338
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	4.906975851723207
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-J√∏rgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	9.529704836321974
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	4.676011351236952
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	4.020808499983732
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	5.726761527533199
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	10.309319593638067
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	6.633761879811965
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	5.249439669367181
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	8.739237659508314
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	5.506250970454115
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	8.204586786657433
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	5.16523576873413
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	6.819145646154792
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	8.100794071001868
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	6.567748838381397
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	8.008677670245229
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	7.783932646781601
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	6.679343432792522
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	7.346800006728084
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	6.774182278301796
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	7.8887463267734805
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	4.957767053264848
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	11.028267244921219
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	6.072507847597656
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	6.78333339374921
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	8.001651866615004
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council' s oral, and also written, reply.	8.601653350720277
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	7.6612664028869
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	8.430971101819376
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	11.486229979270977
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	7.7545505157191235
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	8.807049290004006
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	6.119088811756135
This is also at the request of the citizens.	7.83726208106275
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	6.062118092286971
Thank you for the presentation.	16.26700972035846
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	5.890680123126799
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	8.048657677676962
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	5.47676897682886
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	7.3343684471014585
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	6.552805688790229
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	8.163748547815004
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	6.727458746838128
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	7.778642478800547
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	6.935414786454853
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	6.713980502750299
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	7.874484737402221
We need a public debate on this.	15.696381730265886
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	6.674814712185824
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	4.50882392749973
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	7.738697609855015
And a woman was elected.	4.3634653974310025
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	7.939625161751414
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	6.690900726232697
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	7.349244677863578
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	8.509141864486454
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	7.169618737529295
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	7.95384098319676
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	8.063893373015176
How can we do this?	19.163825659826422
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	8.130522982616029
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	7.642388184738158
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	7.211083371530956
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	11.7624199532792
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	6.898223275989633
I hope we can have further debates like this.	5.7851000604678156
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	6.700029860928414
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	7.093835373875472
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	7.246200254677702
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	6.035294317708968
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	7.03104178047696
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	10.491212674470733
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	5.849917100199856
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	7.768230770842475
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	7.448933019648586
This is totally unacceptable.	1.772362485011997
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	10.775980288338728
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	1.2264779583237335
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	7.7223175493365535
I know that this service is unprofitable.	9.344190482140197
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	7.5183691170195965
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	8.998110564116764
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	5.639532592553093
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	9.093948867947168
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	3.211584061838602
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	10.592611774056069
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	6.573647889639496
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	7.738082029796593
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	3.9440305040876664
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.6009577564360056
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	6.158569796393951
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	6.196254839672398
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	8.635569890305366
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	8.215169925758975
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	7.140256285317181
In other words, our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading: 'Whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate...'	7.525816546603292
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	7.452558129464226
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	6.613989518708392
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	6.268601843161607
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	6.371317966041753
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	10.284555479008302
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	7.688151961134849
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate.	7.210560169697283
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	8.677413462166657
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	9.941346956659661
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	8.566359064909403
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	8.10175082309706
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	7.169424727183595
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	7.93838607579068
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	9.334147093101837
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	6.218127764194601
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	6.823286964146689
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	7.416177378915154
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	6.989238133769746
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	8.634211502779216
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	8.517465191142557
I can perform this dual task.	5.142318779622647
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	7.396860295548369
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	8.269740679712822
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	6.996859345060537
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	7.498309697727185
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	8.404629085451406
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	8.172849708235374
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	5.370045043296899
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	6.227581328296935
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	9.572070825020601
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	7.999678955805957
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	9.194131131730511
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	7.429680047372898
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	7.815393700805069
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	8.941372903619136
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	7.102201191526063
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	9.631949997305943
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	7.095637520060344
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	7.553903336738384
The facts are clear.	7.183293851083595
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	13.39682751679369
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	10.213847971065467
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	3.866059657983497
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	7.667360810491587
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	7.448677640363743
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	7.161329517982669
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	8.021682109182569
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	8.115889745770398
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	6.774916535463715
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	9.138649147327204
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	5.470284422517363
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	10.550755161032493
VOTE	14.22659668727896
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	6.317688895120832
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	7.522235867866863
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	9.511986597699051
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	8.733768503763232
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	5.977415643684131
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	8.752510361153627
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	7.858939616784468
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	6.775580112901884
I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	8.078494457294434
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	8.308758078978737
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	7.393409199253791
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	9.297227641557871
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	9.033776751775257
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	6.277106786463581
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	8.354204303900685
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	4.6978575981580875
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	8.411831496576811
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	9.223094419614448
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	7.2383839910680186
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	2.621916805098001
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	7.65771275150941
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	7.530671671888321
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	14.215460910105914
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	8.276226844140675
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	10.722388079680071
	14.22659668727896
It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	10.597240255856816
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	8.760255575933476
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	5.832219010815199
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	7.1944750044197106
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	7.077752248230191
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	9.403431423812002
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Cl√©ment was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	5.992774616427839
A fault confessed is half redressed.	5.329832915314478
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	5.208125421202017
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	8.284848093872613
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	7.91629380998858
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	6.786305812012348
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	6.265997911620726
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	7.59148756612752
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	6.5118017863762585
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	6.837011044407846
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	8.366538620934767
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	7.7071553767929775
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	6.43388611011015
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	4.864250996751689
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	8.234158325129512
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	6.98294967312572
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	8.10097308870786
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	7.7168815750348925
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	8.307078463724686
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	8.711432404688354
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	8.588872015112658
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	9.98373396288707
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	7.640777233083603
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	7.674856332991918
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage.	6.942897717153103
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	7.204698183236466
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	7.522728769709289
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	6.876056001829595
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	6.925083997748444
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	6.418498875277192
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	8.47528735937905
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	6.791175507930137
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	8.710364867157145
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	6.984944713819744
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	6.688244204390175
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	7.482777359548441
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	9.437557714714771
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	6.576542405563997
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	7.995583662212535
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	6.386599683697046
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	6.851701105811558
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	6.190464906700457
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	8.005905320962901
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	8.015819720293573
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	3.5882510749514887
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	7.31229070197507
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	6.306293585463513
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	7.5187021265885985
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	6.2014811575159365
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	6.224440143240357
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	9.18931325385981
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	5.215381689307259
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	6.53708121954331
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	7.327224457329133
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	9.196359325237744
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	6.606932084679916
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	8.038181709976163
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	5.59112337478757
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	8.08435827782051
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	6.359491482619036
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.250633094454149
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	12.634786760943834
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	4.736990345319745
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	10.712263049156872
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	9.043734754597
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	9.242190111505037
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	7.574085199085438
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	10.865812802029058
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	6.625390003186734
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	6.6944664907475095
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	6.930629243504686
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	6.402773519064287
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	6.601892391452134
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	5.624577860721687
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	5.904897908969952
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	7.151149926508804
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	6.246632310556621
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr D√©sir.	7.548773945371633
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	4.9093719645542695
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	8.807394662372099
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	7.885699218871864
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	6.179364474493631
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	6.951799143836052
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	6.624601880122519
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	5.175627420002723
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	5.997524911245509
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	11.299867906207382
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	6.3843517272067904
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	6.967518382450564
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	8.496396442683798
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	6.6442328312025465
It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	6.568540917759846
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	2.197943196365234
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	6.402686258397883
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	7.288028341634617
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	8.488238565047409
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	4.875527597581666
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	6.882686505463372
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	6.60858173972256
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	7.294343647050741
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	9.963557710425
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	7.443379265078874
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	8.246933050712594
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	6.876835707390378
This requires internal stability.	4.9942132328255875
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	7.8562735806163575
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	7.041267097249989
This is the challenge.	37.731040516510205
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	10.387834091136844
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	6.7603327077332525
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	7.692621602240464
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	7.6144214212849946
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	8.626417389036867
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	6.823716703997556
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	8.93924615869678
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	10.303726086205545
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	7.756530990587236
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	6.062891537728856
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	6.688462406950876
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	9.173176212369901
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	7.870168173682582
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	7.882928775041464
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	9.235961764023513
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	8.191179406023767
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	5.00083910188256
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	5.005819204558624
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	10.605872539740052
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	7.230323304121545
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	8.34516078347367
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	8.830526854884418
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	8.74821608414789
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	4.1062093815679095
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	7.842532806808824
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	7.384389767363457
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lom√© arrangement.	7.4480477731904395
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	8.634616403555194
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	6.630509842492841
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	9.727157211298238
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	8.52558074020371
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	5.857741632858553
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	6.688125545585727
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	8.715634661144282
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	13.877034724631075
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	8.593940124809018
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	5.882827239503337
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	7.848326131937153
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	6.550040441294947
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	8.30855836171232
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	7.183963954116346
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	8.347144323125566
I now come to the content of the report.	3.6033254828801438
That is something we would do well to recognise.	6.5197802260459365
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	7.558732677106177
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	6.750270910493646
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	8.084360677667188
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	7.268538548072732
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	7.778844105328607
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	7.135718678935982
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	7.2561449483160105
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	4.124980473899641
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	6.411063243071928
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	7.407144856209915
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	8.54147214867408
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	5.618009169221135
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	8.927857193641964
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Kn√∂rr for his speediness.	5.833674606301847
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	8.299516062019498
Mr D√©sir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	4.8888127105371435
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	6.620902814241467
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	8.442044986264806
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	10.000482830787305
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	7.8537300816848035
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	9.70389711082666
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	6.8693378497156505
Hence the transmission.	3.026966145779522
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	6.532997863185976
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	10.118708710025663
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	8.16727109267153
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	6.981017738743348
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	8.471344808577449
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	6.408962605215284
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	6.029437143733846
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	4.345870870658908
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	9.714802303245916
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	7.719793612784564
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	7.647447193644232
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	6.590128598255909
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	6.957937155369538
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	7.806458597277168
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	9.368807155752068
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	8.570032578680534
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	6.921903251186958
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	8.6962984145803
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	7.257535737132766
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	4.799799214821794
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	9.919630456926788
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications.	9.345454427543276
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	7.070962184683621
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	7.44539389006347
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	7.563714698136006
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	6.2889856374282695
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	7.081633379709449
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sj√∂stedt, for this question.	4.923427253247892
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	7.9297549753036884
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	6.569686607419169
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	8.310716381432142
This too has not been solved.	11.814306023702587
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	6.833700886759014
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	9.439787870814381
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	7.824977381739609
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	4.618631958331565
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	7.815198609366192
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	7.722465124851984
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	6.672181354167561
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	10.838805882335093
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	7.405429088543359
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	6.15861143228861
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	4.721695792936849
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	8.10838902165065
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	5.412550427128673
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	6.895180061201594
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	6.399428816808966
Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	7.530443608353932
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	6.1080651311421015
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	6.894753833030142
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	6.837629347678647
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	8.067989669222746
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	6.887145726409685
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	6.70720420751626
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	7.188352080744743
Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	8.313187919939965
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	7.850580252938464
Mr B√∂ge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	6.714796496138027
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	8.130182696006631
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	6.433846324919987
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	5.190725483751195
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities.	5.121738160917973
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	7.283645508032045
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	7.711674724752395
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	8.070346157091233
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	7.371553394430271
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	6.727037732152783
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	6.92584610412139
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge D√≠ez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	7.015711466001789
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	7.874687423550836
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	10.516677642853915
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	5.256561812951252
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	6.785979867660698
It is for life.	18.42327506109681
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	9.566709706429913
The second point is human resources.	7.378493595443421
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	8.062751496846799
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	6.8299106513728365
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	6.696545942803032
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	5.669057040208877
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	8.209473661995519
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	7.3044395352855656
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	8.764943223387734
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	10.521116067085092
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	10.939418116735125
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	10.995188486152758
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	6.809841832447925
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	12.767617409939648
We all know that!	13.83685906668457
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	8.044149417939389
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	9.838108027575283
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	7.964458537620778
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	7.2738656433951325
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	8.963169612754879
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	8.765983540484045
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	8.021399526239431
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report.	6.5730240569872755
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	7.84952181555048
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	7.640732254111658
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	6.701108284848806
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	5.165860139590059
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	7.766948294020284
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	9.680649197839655
We can therefore table only one additional item.	7.536935878179192
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	8.703093999722206
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	6.616366029950152
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	9.835004875120354
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	7.3191350158172925
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	4.992665206582291
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	6.674365424974164
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	6.116878703734431
We must give them this opportunity.	6.339568654159381
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	8.492828196676095
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	8.313476242238032
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	6.027195489018205
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	9.335573340954573
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	11.66081542955996
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	7.741023303703799
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	9.930191542876052
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	7.23149489711243
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	6.297097389997426
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	8.658708742619135
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	7.992567086113123
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	8.033833065554411
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	7.715638628491683
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	7.958942432990795
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	11.31735066103966
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	6.027665292089927
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	7.985309092479412
Mr Sj√∂stedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	7.756654764993349
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	4.452784785394537
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	6.85975699840234
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	5.920171942609409
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	5.922247881553951
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	5.561830159737046
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	5.391478651431661
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	8.523616225196761
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	6.851861391820701
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	8.827970803917628
That too is feasible.	6.74094144277651
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	7.736769273568568
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	6.010566331573157
The last century was marked by three periods.	6.120381888484709
I wish to discuss two matters.	13.527414414923776
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	6.703157448255523
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	7.922153871610581
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	7.624559505523483
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	7.453878855001997
I know I can rely on everyone here.	5.708376164531954
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	7.963537743779127
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	12.096742224232123
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	8.812887166103419
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	5.017885019679916
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	10.47064768773903
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	9.063523253172022
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	6.93420986149304
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	5.872724829281971
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	7.532252178701163
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	6.918529998937783
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	8.027520631898645
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	7.857751520783706
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	7.058345638168599
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	7.1787333558582365
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	8.450566422724593
European postal services	117.4619764725538
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	7.347588891892562
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	7.5112116998466
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	8.639945494964719
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	6.830818234227223
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	7.685677461278538
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	7.094165069838247
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	7.101259551260871
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	7.595644481032595
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	8.275188138980385
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	9.699868432730009
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	6.362194421202487
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	7.375092281484671
The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	7.15380446982569
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	7.359416106210771
We are not talking about words here.	7.599911276099038
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	7.317572731500584
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	10.279493889184083
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	7.203619030631014
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	9.55934071182006
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	6.668763008484006
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	2.0049829024677996
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	8.816299119044405
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	6.6686599587699655
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	7.769924776988471
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	8.80361449645625
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	10.9743244975929
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	6.70697686678308
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	7.961415689585958
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	6.398868477606684
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	6.80724543932394
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	7.9109362519601145
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	8.290525861531304
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	6.0438167154515705
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	7.246335596302512
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	4.427840640603418
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	7.013232880236207
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	7.116183191887404
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	7.914629106506847
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	8.062989591365515
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	6.690165629760448
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	9.473500440200006
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	6.770398884728295
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	6.821164313428429
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	6.615315710696417
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	6.7167968449668765
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	7.359951501868285
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Gra√ßa Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	5.768387250252859
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	8.870465382206795
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	8.785724134320136
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	7.584683944985711
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	9.00113586021547
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	5.9736324227677455
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	6.441740971398754
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	7.265923814245946
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	7.453413210988229
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	7.104252589568027
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	4.180499311244807
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	3.75458229761093
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	8.549039565561708
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	9.13359714443342
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	8.433485896477857
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	8.024520710568918
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	2.488295325366505
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	7.510970884017797
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	8.897404118074206
It is quite the opposite.	6.218034402854138
In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	8.049487369428226
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	7.697681366123832
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	6.085351527441205
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	6.547905420734731
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	6.619124915977217
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	8.410103442975362
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	5.281703936473186
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	5.0946821354872105
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	8.316569351202782
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	7.228209377782244
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	9.557420270472894
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	7.502922042417753
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	7.1578918039213475
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	6.830884431477322
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	7.687362614040698
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	5.784607445962216
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	9.751530669777987
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr R√ºbig, who also talked about e-commerce.	6.88851983256947
At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	7.5975196314697895
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	8.974767399052256
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	5.9598268831915675
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	7.01939854891777
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	9.750889450586682
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	8.565060985383056
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	9.481998384205925
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	7.189787651335036
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	7.651796346121518
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	8.398398037833005
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	8.283326751368934
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	6.4568041935234355
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	7.995048231144513
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	8.802622562456385
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	8.451165261045421
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	8.464655380709546
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	7.9007885345906095
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	8.10116236809681
But there has been nothing for a year.	10.029832077438876
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	7.5734415206837475
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	13.836161362113076
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	7.327988558322271
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	8.00034601679708
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	6.796828620641643
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	7.737467734716131
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	8.219413441691493
It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	6.224286053255014
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	5.59168151526911
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	4.05256575741667
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	4.911459113701192
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	8.362531506041385
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	6.914625453787755
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	8.363062286615627
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	6.950271359982557
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	7.120862310329295
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	6.456128434734787
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	5.307423292163025
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	7.8254199518983505
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	6.210600544806618
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	6.141483666201495
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	7.534444025114226
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	8.072572002077033
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	8.850501197199446
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	6.797122431639008
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	6.419240265044212
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	5.824288404654005
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	6.6442962583304475
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	7.9040542541260415
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	8.905736993829231
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	6.807327694756464
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	5.808384027036947
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	7.480416435662397
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	5.365779224787792
We already have a directive.	8.397618671481592
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	4.987618840892463
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	8.072773861185553
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	8.301833769963414
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	8.694480034350635
Mr D√©sir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	5.468109997117542
I should also like to thank Mr B√∂ge for his work on this issue.	5.213730135930415
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	8.068662371575515
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	5.863508226607429
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	9.098660437457854
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	9.145869764122402
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	7.87266011927856
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	7.071554051736585
I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	6.94479917230863
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	9.25258814958989
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	8.769685243165902
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	8.99378938743305
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	6.1101564890585065
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	5.729801928928294
I think ours is a different approach!	8.058482044251715
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	10.721984823641748
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	7.426457090942162
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	8.880538360621575
So much for the first comment.	14.855551600311076
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	7.495352935892486
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	8.116889961746791
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	8.01916961742674
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	8.919936513142995
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	8.462584172575518
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	7.5402190314607624
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	6.303068608631033
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	7.941427319427981
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	6.175776341830616
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	5.097114764580753
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	8.943087189847686
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	8.192194542619914
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	6.458140180133513
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	7.049314839715468
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	8.897593505616786
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	9.248229977271974
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	1.9707712800516117
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	7.556019367061752
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	6.906480861496968
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	6.3293059684471205
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	7.154557602527308
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	7.627083741926015
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	8.969345960227118
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	6.419692186999636
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	12.032399048606326
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	7.6270282492978545
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	10.399099651951568
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	7.934548043615271
You have not integrated it anywhere.	6.501879484109339
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	6.701163538470387
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	8.769243766088103
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	6.166620521953502
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	7.475847119340626
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	12.440939063609866
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	7.732037919319769
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	8.69974348465841
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	7.122961046881986
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	7.527273218228003
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	8.293743173703703
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	10.19751002913188
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	6.474689481852801
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	8.958797012961057
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	6.761206573614718
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	5.462569098979817
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	8.42496553467088
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	7.505401358668212
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	7.916987795695269
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	9.237924573570274
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	7.099989357200805
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	18.083322772845253
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	7.215527782904484
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	15.651941327648826
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	1.2416934119428706
.	52.89722204958655
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	8.45879590828631
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	5.523157637879265
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	7.569407004835433
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	5.7549142356755425
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	7.714249541587711
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	7.7363720368325755
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	7.139922206425872
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	5.970655227565863
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	8.994640919994934
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	5.770617413458423
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	8.401675559137582
Will it discuss the matter?	6.784454551952149
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	7.96651431438446
That is a reduction of 3¬æ % compared with the previous CIs.	10.627237700830594
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	8.12997367914316
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	9.466679854734858
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	11.16009295226713
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	6.783696413938784
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	8.791827219103563
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	5.081910336529103
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	7.491312874590373
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	7.619345451801392
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	8.223271808276252
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	4.074755505179201
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	7.666511998057726
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	1.1438227504289553
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	6.215269657057221
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	8.324765935458524
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	6.315399946736556
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	14.489264404149559
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	8.451908995019267
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	7.402531064628534
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	8.08600266359309
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	5.766387739803443
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	5.97402040674543
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	8.353340419085326
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	7.339409554188529
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	7.305254849706957
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	8.814041860075085
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	6.992816540366112
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	2.7955239407637906
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	4.503307769999548
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	6.469449856407756
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	5.941011291418108
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	5.805587285848653
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	11.131116285204453
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	7.204970273670687
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	7.405588103997069
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	8.12025988120889
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	6.263879985833115
It must be visible.	6.094301926144696
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	8.280395985367546
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	8.057312994589816
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	9.133264684354414
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	6.279693158320765
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	5.811743596353867
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	6.957693338658208
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	6.457335538549001
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	8.717315304649105
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	5.732267049926105
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	6.233766272319606
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	6.1868177802522935
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	10.23664818739203
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	6.06727863000479
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	2.8308740160293033
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	5.709538789398586
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	6.849322711842701
I think that this will be problematic.	8.612646213785082
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	10.779645816989031
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	7.102074113658634
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	9.592771015527239
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	7.970879227718112
I think we need to retain it.	9.341946416942664
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	7.985089197492353
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	7.1696002666222896
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	8.220614956408678
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	9.064532073191296
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	8.612906820889567
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	20.41882087909061
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	7.075274157745012
I have had a little to do with this too.	11.049862000420452
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	7.15236434934524
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	6.957700469658413
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	6.007963269964976
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	6.611516206248319
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	7.597388489691286
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	7.807128130465847
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	8.152912701604507
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	8.951558487442252
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	7.976092928411951
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	6.465765091075885
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	9.205598375624753
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	6.575565016351838
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	7.050930203007648
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	7.401648285617118
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	9.342776731287708
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	9.137009391651313
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	6.817646774760329
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	8.41071161401249
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	6.626357827517087
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	8.41039758037095
There have only been nine rejections.	2.775031912484182
And do you know why?	8.593219504815247
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	6.565867753762822
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	7.084346943768315
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	7.585261696760995
Before the vote	378.11642758350433
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	9.58207693314766
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	7.11949777956457
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	9.357160876611708
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	8.201782173551825
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.563489818211283
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	7.763816919769564
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	6.404846320941734
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	8.51479614145853
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	7.5521847971017415
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	8.977984310968958
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	7.814706319811614
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	5.358166419168555
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	7.33125463950675
According to the Commission' s proposal -20¬∫C would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	8.129686534991322
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	3.5891057341494887
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	9.613786471045653
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	7.804499273653124
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.4630121361876132
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	7.255741254979915
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	5.835732469494617
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	9.346687619580635
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	7.6071182696214095
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	7.386096420414919
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	10.25533475958075
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	5.78802468892268
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	5.1237587684373365
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	8.11431295253174
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	6.503362227461273
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	7.9083144548303554
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	10.918946948963917
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	9.923014086951909
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	5.805189194505007
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	7.096374497223459
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	7.782255186162569
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	6.961686789358071
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	6.507804029329546
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	7.7658039118229345
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	9.348873434611225
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	6.825607069346904
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	7.770297982088871
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	7.070586820712867
However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	8.909507317248966
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	8.508202469612355
It is about brominated flame retardants.	5.8202188786336615
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	6.694763675268556
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	7.937612635091978
This is something we have borne in mind.	6.631422438592332
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	6.172551495984393
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	7.417290211218047
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	5.256097401899561
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	7.98637860234725
This brings me to the content of the report.	3.1951849074027323
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	8.668570391397626
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	6.666001941564972
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	5.824458769057382
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	7.827966679571014
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	8.032042501373795
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	7.299878799871912
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	5.837318641712951
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	5.078059323774924
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	5.690702160109216
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	5.608611852890382
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	5.603440411692713
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	6.431579859663657
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	7.727651428326341
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	6.432740296106509
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	6.6036512059803085
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	8.909509447193198
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	8.729086969869
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	15.72747847583182
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	8.137759054489953
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	7.501919585286787
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.	6.472421404016545
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	7.830385482763742
I would like to thank Mrs Grosset√™te and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	6.932357967254221
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	7.792361429933511
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	5.805815259943034
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	5.963191308155214
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	3.837736065685421
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	6.933698028207025
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	7.030528907909999
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	7.209482302072473
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	4.2960748321505635
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	7.687234829038337
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	9.295170941773785
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	8.76406759042374
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	6.391626356122176
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	5.685352451144847
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	6.8914358993294025
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	8.517987844249834
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	9.443635274718638
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	6.39154312809904
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	7.870116449600685
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	6.061582455870657
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	8.987613294115704
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	7.4265460728263895
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	6.973172321135985
.	52.89722204958655
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	6.463343970498194
How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	7.337737682214463
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	4.57816031286672
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	9.338906725128636
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	6.254467582247503
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	6.22133577706927
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	5.965861511688221
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	6.462484443371079
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	4.145385393367988
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	9.542653504018432
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	6.991276259628087
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	8.376798086330314
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	4.7145761885162925
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	6.179088495973322
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	6.655517849048253
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	7.697669862716452
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	7.1993270141774754
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	7.2177309293678045
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	12.087992674067188
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	7.4669448291942215
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	9.18321933347638
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, pr√©juger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	8.584100407385138
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	7.318347297892296
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	8.070953094215215
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	9.028538979979317
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	7.148683505228969
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	9.050868874379606
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	9.514447389264454
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	6.190933434460015
Urgent change is required today.	5.914197325536101
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	7.721570250814554
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	9.675179928447182
We need to work.	39.14217461043246
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	8.853425953376446
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	8.207725136583765
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	7.195284756847822
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	6.685332611380543
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	8.19949100324881
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	6.082647965315983
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	10.899535235907356
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	8.281200395441132
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	8.276838767685911
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	6.768971635434504
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	9.61160477832521
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	6.304427328988597
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	7.543832246101794
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	7.2860981190599325
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	1.1438227504289553
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	7.265185960723487
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	5.306159704496035
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	8.180509309606492
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	7.698931363095087
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	9.910769118744888
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	7.497214919977109
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	9.639280892008927
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	5.648659682109426
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	7.414995920789654
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	7.9871056743708335
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	9.521570046616112
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	6.439472471342326
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	7.981616441935437
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	9.337260930494903
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	8.969753758321279
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	4.744508329237291
The FP√ñ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	5.842633890728793
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	6.178010063177772
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	6.724175282254741
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	8.110761901107145
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	7.366467397815008
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	6.910109474991404
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	6.032477143691928
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	7.005456137583021
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	5.613457978306345
Parliament has completed the agenda.	4.30425395094579
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	8.34169704557495
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	7.790644041982516
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	6.11220154369888
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	7.737814553874813
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	9.400617185357875
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	8.324917134920467
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	4.493008470844436
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	7.168093083558302
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	7.888769445072726
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	4.542482495236985
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	11.707990199971311
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	11.411409407671245
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	7.292551596525576
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	7.59222108983934
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	7.517995616699403
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	6.065272038669544
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	7.333331092305455
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	6.292843694652287
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	6.354859831195558
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	7.316199342256668
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	8.571666162514626
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	5.599329863798669
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	8.669359836377335
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	11.23776434370021
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	6.567229581363852
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	6.960328985340166
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	6.5541379667841495
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	6.6198736934879125
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	6.83727692789789
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	8.056931413489826
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	7.219323284119598
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	7.002047764841284
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	8.197179625975918
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	5.621853281035279
I should like to mention a few specific points.	5.841512186295529
That does not apply to Austria alone.	10.28137654602345
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	7.164089205160209
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	6.347552474936575
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	7.351224271319988
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	8.324126016337582
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	7.879146770748089
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	5.94075459776239
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	5.4784264121234445
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	7.232966315704675
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	6.502451373410742
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	7.308938232691883
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	6.198933670519479
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	7.551458411883171
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	6.965720883361351
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	8.069000544950752
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	7.2714581199325945
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	8.349346851831244
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	7.614104596828099
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	5.525883779743013
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	7.196115136316658
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	9.540334791096553
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	8.716075847971693
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	7.556024479611172
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	7.074986023091821
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	6.760651458407575
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	5.6027669171237635
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	6.2484632454890905
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	8.188693650741444
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	9.126400008645465
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	9.38109925465025
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	8.950781778034193
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	7.587076278613948
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	7.905092004754429
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	6.9785074885166125
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	7.924575484970069
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	6.9760984056055815
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	8.415227582026391
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	10.759375386527175
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	8.581221633374241
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	8.300601917913486
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	8.739922854084094
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	7.7626394834090435
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	7.540959922878655
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	9.254137037431333
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	6.6231272162355985
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	7.0938567020800045
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	7.899437092814255
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	6.378891940010988
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	9.726738432415543
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	5.578917793240236
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	6.155065251628795
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	7.19488322776639
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	7.748267489823652
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	7.337810810918012
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	2.8435789170651313
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	7.440426293939072
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	5.897179726740916
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	7.537091040093358
I appreciate Mrs Cederschi√∂ld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	6.930954484153563
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	9.145048345093546
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	9.3559986426263
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	5.922290551780917
I wish we were closer to that.	6.227400192696854
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	10.702520343872926
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	6.948755864375247
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	8.938897585997536
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	9.78282952283349
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	9.219407450663875
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	8.116019125693956
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	8.192649082048522
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lom√© Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	6.409860060034047
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	7.635872877126104
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	8.256599534490318
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	5.711012739539447
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	6.224283034583729
I hope for their adoption.	7.276360038319025
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	5.011210311895571
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	8.622599571981995
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	7.0603169942322035
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	7.458827957777075
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	8.48633907177842
The vote will be taken later this evening.	8.070967392861707
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	10.011742051115622
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	8.676480331742754
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	6.951982132936511
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	7.0023973183793125
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	6.7460468574600725
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	7.830579160779916
Chancellor Sch√ºssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	8.347174089186671
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	9.495881213635775
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.972487966703713
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	7.375764379513064
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	7.360397762071449
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	8.138206954079298
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	6.6211267207311355
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	9.238272564073535
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	7.033727511157835
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	5.424492339658536
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	6.488697142156016
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	4.7971005430081
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	5.532610832329373
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	5.8156376027417656
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	7.054309965723994
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	9.924470946902995
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.	6.545857481784392
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	8.281199736983673
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	6.086237212186592
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	7.382695992193788
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	7.6733165808766515
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	7.136036047167014
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	6.5079200918700115
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	7.002985890180113
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	6.561831161066343
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	6.099344092497857
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	6.037932274553402
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	5.9179501860282056
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	8.15665589718816
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	9.589949034213072
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	7.044747202728815
What are we doing about it?	5.363729587132635
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .	7.4879012677554435
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	6.445102960767035
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	8.084813655680215
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	5.7380364289045005
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	8.233335395989165
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	7.491469706783851
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	7.773796421643949
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	7.046369749480468
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	5.992785690122885
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	10.28410177496499
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	5.476037833023897
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	11.857865201680514
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	7.002488132491419
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	7.429448752755465
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	11.891594829058963
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	7.061315254265888
That, however, is not my question.	9.950823163296867
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	5.357109289615518
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate.	4.953619302124091
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	8.974437700423566
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	10.534818447907345
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	8.815900488360231
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	7.6746385913986215
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	5.754416612651895
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	8.531681406549824
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	8.452501813769524
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	8.492118042528244
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	6.8761932943573445
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	9.247026876218857
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	6.403964151371042
We have seen vote after vote lost.	8.867303704976266
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	8.140663101657601
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	6.850712899005645
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	5.798032208615297
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	7.942155254950765
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	6.816574303602784
All those things come together.	5.65837150754416
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	6.965740511273911
The other parties are not paying.	5.5568047658940785
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	5.562984770517449
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	6.862461671074435
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	10.722424291697624
The problem has been overcome.	5.374781072048054
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	8.400202092632693
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	7.147173407485387
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	5.516674309683355
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	7.054920447955829
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	7.525780911746376
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	7.102928116184115
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.	8.472879623829217
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	8.05024235877191
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	7.125758809109922
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	10.480153049067926
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	6.942411277857303
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	9.051332162108505
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	8.120697563415504
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	6.994982363157156
Not necessary!	22.88487117976323
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	11.6930152692517
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	7.1415277602592955
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	8.735375338857317
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.)	3.8160231336913952
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	7.2656057594048855
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	4.805078576008276
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	4.6554059147816
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	7.296914386901877
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	6.065012427457758
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	6.818386452814815
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	6.992141419010795
Instead of prematurely condemning the FP√ñ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	7.0474647527016385
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	6.928025499082412
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	8.622915237764802
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lom√© Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	6.40975714192105
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	11.195400340500425
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	5.75065382743135
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge D√≠ez Elorza.	3.4187974416649998
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	7.006476147167014
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	5.768019536185195
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	7.547891076405149
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	7.762522792142039
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	7.124469702610173
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	6.634789471139985
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	7.116707851189958
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	6.841372269190183
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	6.784708516190983
Let me explain.	4.150503251450327
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	8.153916007431484
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	9.088053799247232
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	7.244023500885854
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	2.159972537599984
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	11.027713859958903
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	6.826636055780642
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
We await the outcome with great interest.	5.075343769836957
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	5.090511998748958
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	4.555978361200286
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	8.361126905783406
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	7.0432975454957525
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	9.121869420544021
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	8.053091192487779
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	6.9077044925850215
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	6.448106507525465
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	7.346709725738892
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	7.8600755313384285
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	7.297514028825617
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	5.989150681020373
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	8.26956548013823
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	7.2598441631426125
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.929365572168684
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	7.08385037828033
Agenda	14.22659668727896
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	2.6289648078809518
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	6.9864957257513565
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	11.880294280400554
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	6.180770665435893
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	6.139351439749653
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	9.441985713759914
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	8.14815749059587
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	5.520398857139192
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	6.720401420254814
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	8.758683912458578
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	7.794225718560198
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	6.444790203468614
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	9.226939746179324
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	7.574724065805687
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	5.823365645797738
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	8.95667846262932
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	5.445882952251101
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	8.439261557395795
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	6.060967389119787
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	7.679954556922027
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	6.553772439597337
That has only happened recently.	5.462739673993051
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	5.510921540090393
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	7.642203772108242
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	7.386548057243899
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	5.988893359881072
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	6.668288679352808
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	8.345830981513151
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	8.053044581220545
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	5.991049422434756
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	6.019849592953879
Report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS))	1.850878840202274
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	8.161170938237971
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	7.842091366892858
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	5.70037421651494
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	8.034807842937616
This first step is so important because of this model function.	8.895088954790577
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	7.02958103793536
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	7.62341785864945
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions.	8.825891449320478
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	11.507640951107794
These are the main reasons for my vote.	4.550119445611001
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	6.268407619859867
Should we complain about this delay?	6.29572086177029
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	7.089795631836835
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	7.568791041112123
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	6.053613757543404
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	7.902478182323945
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	6.070705888396155
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	5.6132737464170095
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	7.633342581127486
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	7.4600789751313386
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	6.466110994408291
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	6.088857829619806
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	6.733019159011912
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	7.840385207806986
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	5.248415512204713
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	7.255723433057926
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	8.579676580320072
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	10.812213206299349
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	6.767149413481445
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	7.146626976810303
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	8.005443866758547
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	7.2690982414334515
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	6.6405343786188755
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	7.799680491333145
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	6.691124806856744
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	7.530061119661583
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	6.296711441602863
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD))	1.9166160393144263
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	8.0260745966818
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	4.233618276971103
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	7.677202213387056
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	8.105432017646843
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	6.331734448857404
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union' .	8.349586156862111
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	6.2688165890235386
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	8.581935280216541
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	7.477687761446425
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	8.90073505198571
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	7.474219026506176
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	9.974197542043925
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	6.1291938605166525
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	8.852718005113084
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	14.322863901149592
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	7.263581504357688
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	5.839809892736603
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	7.144786571903846
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	8.249899169517278
Thank you for your attention.	5.57019641732847
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	8.021924301959059
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	9.804265865329064
This was an important consideration for us.	8.175712241106519
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	9.443914970292736
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	7.418164322534828
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	7.561276586079932
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	6.590902375598094
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	8.00105905379918
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	8.246428958716466
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	10.509347821734858
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	6.080836455583198
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	8.310326717163768
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	7.111544654591103
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	5.268263332119419
It is something that we can all support.	6.478180978796163
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	8.169457987298074
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	5.011068272345529
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	5.6837334142738705
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	8.089412832598535
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	7.605301074681872
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	6.753180433052553
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	8.608931112987056
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	8.960380918352344
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	7.18188354765589
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	7.944750086187723
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	7.5555041720321485
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	8.427583106402059
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	7.843115567682658
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Gr√∂nitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	6.391455790619931
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	11.900151905562401
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	11.816207174546715
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	6.505709617347313
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	6.010803639130525
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	7.160198910862116
What she has said here is completely justified.	7.7476588816933365
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.	8.25332086169054
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	6.986401502501201
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	8.868381588355298
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	7.454605360075008
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	5.846879184969855
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	8.205359467917372
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	7.333633431071328
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	7.094422013277567
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	8.520341164156186
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	10.457647349605333
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	9.73320190377674
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	6.9857116796149565
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	4.490432142949282
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	6.344933127166565
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	7.92993523095262
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	8.92635977900536
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	7.680223504755023
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	7.000056801649069
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	7.8289866979813665
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	6.890855281280412
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	8.10317588373026
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	5.419793158329739
That concludes the explanations of vote.	7.684447716877535
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	8.498050461188448
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	6.793544929847053
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	9.34244169352843
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	9.92402553530691
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	6.384286021813122
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD))	2.102229680301857
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	4.5544709083213375
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallstr√∂m' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	8.242275081509
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	7.070583650722891
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	6.774992714740437
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	9.070374196431098
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	5.937462510761191
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	6.272673363852457
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	7.697141612586269
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	6.212656267718867
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	12.165443212588297
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	5.804227747603762
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	5.964705874441069
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	7.792464569666276
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	7.220788906799407
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	7.234623036042173
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	7.061910705777184
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	7.2045095213132555
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	7.600814025314937
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	7.4979259627334605
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	4.328064115395464
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	7.971199226487073
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	6.881948838250068
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	7.006072940913928
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	6.039276969837787
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	7.864060128558672
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	7.550275102354342
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	8.017107746288872
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	7.098507755955542
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	9.589265004042293
There is no other such policy.	18.827443092083765
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	7.982255375408447
A paper this short is a farce.	5.009164136140974
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	5.909304776738311
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	8.81142250106749
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	9.85340457617427
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	7.790456583222088
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	7.689568166778681
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	11.188048767142172
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	4.788986240697733
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	7.712320070735723
This is not the usual state of affairs.	7.871658327505348
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	7.655888211833198
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	5.782168457711583
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	6.069901593934992
Forgive me Mr Poos.	3.7411475419439704
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	8.536067000284135
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	9.389527143896174
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	8.49349565412245
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	7.338529659883973
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	6.757203310585019
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	6.457521581692737
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	8.042761470395153
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	9.552639371233994
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	6.539328270370618
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	4.903621291814828
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	7.130024684420157
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	8.13393142115168
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	9.912100783184675
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	6.998048309669431
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	8.867209204798533
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	6.429173233197642
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	5.544888594129219
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	10.862891834212057
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	7.204766237283591
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	9.547911123491465
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	6.283980225072336
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	5.680465674379099
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	8.77939538272391
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	6.681757503398163
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	6.641061166390401
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	8.756548726893854
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	8.773530107660868
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	7.965783153253763
We support that.	6.623968026998383
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	4.7763796249416375
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	8.823345778634495
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	8.043859424445664
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	7.959203368964856
.	52.89722204958655
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	6.1120951129176655
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	9.308303953854136
They have paid already.	4.992015647682146
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	9.364911419053763
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	5.5646397605231925
I think this is a good agreement.	5.126756284973254
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	6.793418701986361
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	8.985515149070244
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	7.335376719246394
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	6.7095246628708605
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	3.7443539511370703
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	6.980098667039081
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	8.283187397554805
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	7.827620109007688
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	7.579800609833648
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	6.027891089818558
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	8.544828268967931
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	8.677688419754856
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	7.2520535522083
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	7.84308094973864
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	8.666859713274196
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	7.183035758313687
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	8.28136926890862
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	6.252624067418587
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	5.456190376413352
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	8.968023074014857
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	10.020661704161327
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	6.5493277942618375
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	6.824767453758965
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	6.289130532703566
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	8.602198703280376
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	5.705013589987336
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	7.630528856472022
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	7.535107849529578
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	9.338608715830572
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	8.665267840689948
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr D√©sir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	4.955018891239282
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	8.266275739036542
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr B√∂ge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	7.880922511251737
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	6.50949257907871
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	6.193198333875024
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	7.210466195920959
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	6.742181751191166
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	7.967255169926305
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	8.615984806466836
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	7.1648870692909
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	8.985085718555506
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	5.743065682470242
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	8.441962712830438
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	6.152109345841597
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	6.976609245872842
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	6.61530307073942
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	7.404733707256253
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	6.744601299552125
They are very important in this case.	7.350182199492754
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	7.097050762275428
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Est√©vez.	5.874209008659884
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	8.788533739036373
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	9.699668915634813
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	5.819594654157361
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25¬∫ centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	7.108686916462
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	6.4882079678398235
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	8.861124640097067
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	6.840149163658944
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	5.774328726074194
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	7.400934298426427
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	7.365515785489054
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	3.665007647731491
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	5.966566337728357
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	6.36382052890226
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	7.155448441178066
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	6.898902653096709
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	6.8153817731332325
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr B√∂ge has just done.	8.521865890509877
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	4.827374441553751
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	7.179243815275659
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	8.347089562548675
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	6.34777535662566
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	2.4980009807141847
Or on Shell?	4.661447478347376
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	7.541602923381702
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	6.755154765684361
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	7.853521479154523
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	9.141077720466026
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	9.425957743596664
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	6.606171952962811
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	7.923746945967434
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	6.980654750287553
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	7.523386036066441
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	6.350661075589638
So who is this then?	8.640398019279672
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	7.227854165318054
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	7.7263564079117995
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	9.44735689143126
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	6.702942407728977
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	7.6104993325933465
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	7.224454010937386
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	6.635359699710706
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	7.248770906365487
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	7.141538628515385
I beg you to intervene.	6.294670983320477
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	6.67214963580227
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	5.964360055720755
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	7.073740213877293
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	7.786060084080922
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	7.2674775008622206
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	8.800739243912123
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	6.8268029979422895
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	7.006845246779385
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	8.464128177786193
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	8.277637316004814
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	6.972114480402272
Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	6.355914241059043
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	7.401729307911623
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	3.6213403965752153
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	8.22127171828091
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	6.8124897537642255
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	7.0463098229128525
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gas√≤liba I B√∂hm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	5.5556111988193875
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	7.578412595857114
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	6.210561840685294
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	6.560890527995302
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	8.617110901768744
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	5.963764069557008
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	2.812484718545425
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	7.807096744699109
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	6.870582319630835
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	7.4275082895227715
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	8.317123222778202
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	8.105932815680516
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	1.1438227504289553
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	7.864295120988974
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	6.986790461862726
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	7.178720133952611
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	8.486687191638463
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	7.6630826210404175
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	9.651138367866896
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	6.426260952460322
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	10.231977943229559
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	2.441469939972649
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	9.373100920938072
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	8.640933393721312
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	6.368775033395569
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	7.626238126867599
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	8.487856727447976
Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Gra√ßa Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD))	1.9445061871195273
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	6.69068744663433
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	6.921551287798492
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	5.81000943158262
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	6.169078103866991
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	9.122971648688097
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	8.45083354093191
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	8.300185543090764
Conditions are ripe.	2.2955787902611626
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	8.298925925629806
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	7.658449153495216
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	10.16254467538816
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	9.620585664959645
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	7.6627178847569875
That is in line with the draft resolution.	5.263087023795829
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	7.466285249313768
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	9.942272990824337
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	8.237454063225766
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	11.362290398796539
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	7.288917561169221
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	10.556483447981682
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	5.9936039999999675
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	6.1810833253642645
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	5.375457381537807
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	7.191127186101684
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	9.012824526722245
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	7.882971748349455
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	6.3325938947273235
We should not be so na√Øve as to think otherwise.	7.13444801587707
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	7.47126806425698
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	4.658342080500375
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	11.21247549831956
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	6.451845158067598
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	6.834038242080998
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	7.152854816233623
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	5.679732299509678
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	7.4004433264850435
It is far too prescriptive.	6.413596842693217
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	9.888301387478208
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	6.381300293476673
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	5.515157665362659
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	7.203143212067136
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	7.319555078714693
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	8.229161346903581
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	6.172113834509199
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	6.6843581442433155
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	8.361723229396507
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	6.6946938851622235
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	7.0037286338799625
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	7.188435022010403
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	6.571501560174206
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	7.1971867793881
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	7.794287265135609
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	10.535257142148726
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almer√≠a.	7.313467481472567
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	7.929453141015971
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	6.621525634052478
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	6.889003876784199
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	8.872080176108947
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	6.749123976469325
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	4.674943068646173
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	7.399106259564144
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	6.417230103163481
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	7.695957549415497
Let us be honest.	6.013518510879282
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	6.73576363600013
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	7.625899723223407
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	7.299709018763193
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	7.345712594928749
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	6.963851100756356
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	6.240879450930994
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	8.867595064406405
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	7.753997284742151
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	8.566228455752519
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	7.43566206395248
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	6.463883627561993
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	9.147179320123305
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	7.4597206864001855
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	6.669056398766079
The Commission has no means of influence here.	10.789234113141637
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	8.58338316101691
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	8.437833670577735
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	6.436495052802716
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	7.413257412897132
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	7.1598147780981325
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	4.883283056315117
The postal service is also the doctor.	5.171831696246608
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	7.93635785593674
I do not believe so.	12.836440185938795
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	7.352844400842559
Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	7.268925851403129
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	4.236851324061595
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	7.401310351132272
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	6.837172692287517
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	10.26045296357178
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	5.068828175253875
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	7.344773822416779
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	9.841254578503206
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	6.801959175637367
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	7.655698751748931
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	5.661280061630212
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	6.943468825169306
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	7.50080788169898
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	7.736165980479772
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	6.458118718867947
But the figures tell the true story.	6.027626988701709
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	7.433805066334265
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	6.857064884660741
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	8.433214538139609
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	7.289701956977941
Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	5.122066572383174
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	7.301322438382643
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	7.900412882744152
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	6.818419919792246
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	9.32824585247282
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	5.255007351336428
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	7.159186248970671
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	1.1438227504289553
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	7.125508958067106
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	7.03095760692354
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	8.471782907984098
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	7.690151953290692
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	6.605043184682598
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	6.210643687402321
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	7.112369819019785
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	7.953243491622908
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	5.624702539609184
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	2.158750264835313
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	8.06702042429554
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	7.874119571813937
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	8.782808393933141
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	6.915139685915725
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	9.218038641878776
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	10.940821756650754
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	6.331549639542023
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	11.59033828224179
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	7.263111990165466
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	6.214079516731735
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	8.11005431299986
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	7.599423741647786
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	4.8641051012048395
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	6.647781192624925
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	7.306489238260451
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.	7.490215587213313
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	9.7736667074026
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	3.424032659312282
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	8.35146573526493
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	6.3854728905907026
It is an imperative.	28.53941868482981
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	7.1106813417855985
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	4.4105420568876665
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	9.472934852204453
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	7.43590781674841
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	6.048828296948001
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	8.062587303995283
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	6.976735485962002
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	6.126216955109646
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	6.559177287789156
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	7.551362699235784
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	6.208720041112673
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	6.9549886812414465
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	6.978358868674589
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	8.544344238915345
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	6.476627154478513
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	8.94538961199008
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	8.466665312146882
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	7.544294974391744
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	8.486400902176475
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	6.850788721398607
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	13.510425025446603
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	9.789618036050694
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	9.878118009979097
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	8.439937994644621
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	7.816816188925993
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	8.74662994594772
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	7.849188350094056
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	7.831209009024717
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	5.718136614794671
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	8.287985295683509
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	5.5391830773595965
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	6.536281688488018
Never have the parties been so determined.	6.548061397960376
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	9.11882600752677
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	16.179879589423454
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	14.726803438135237
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	8.547471803775254
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	7.054200902596219
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	6.368277537696517
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	10.809749508068762
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	8.475121515906999
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	7.389017759247718
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	8.1569055669625
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	7.201456353030317
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	7.663658141439549
This is unacceptable in my view.	3.757998293488501
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	8.259914657721792
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	12.206457523020427
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	8.217180573277437
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	7.398826741752735
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	6.2667241007417696
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	12.042780864583868
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	7.745860113884067
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	8.792003670236278
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	6.474320338217912
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	9.686012949143597
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	8.512316985259227
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	7.048367367527063
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	9.751970425561217
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	4.941925035984493
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	8.098831759353365
I. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (5713/1999 - C5-0020/1999 - 1999/0803(CNS))	1.8756952415249442
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	5.046975974290028
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	9.21927921828706
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	6.700878966813304
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	7.862756833028131
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	7.963485612592503
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	6.607529304608683
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	6.249225856230438
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	7.0568215506566565
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	7.063391344906796
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	6.8998946857921695
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	4.433070658632304
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	8.310930996278543
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	9.098973086006998
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	7.539132356309571
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	7.489632651457746
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	6.934533140457595
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	7.906251104718376
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	15.518668258833804
Including J√∂rg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	6.64343305305779
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	4.027700266706949
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	7.4805437849616
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	13.231474771857641
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	7.231418812579585
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	6.022229342935124
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	6.624216513335492
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	6.949601518993292
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	6.090840316689374
(Loud applause)	1.0785651321630196
There are reputable companies too.	5.2888957627924755
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	7.821933931024411
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.5315497741220137
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	9.690441594186138
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	7.690617507037276
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	9.222498153716915
My final point is this.	6.449816589101447
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	6.803042009037836
I hope that before the end of this new Lom√© Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	10.307410848017787
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	7.63782768648935
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	10.21587496318486
I do not think so.	4.0603066681738085
The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	7.308587627781383
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	7.822163275400256
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	6.849943088059776
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	7.53926435665786
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	9.09329809173549
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	9.544442472609122
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	6.83708437034158
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	4.559767272483232
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	8.406983741732105
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	6.769767249919481
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	4.445518588160627
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	7.575197832835496
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	7.859652622781042
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	7.119071856992378
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	9.415534247927624
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	6.951138649942622
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	11.129461392510438
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	6.407869554629079
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	7.29469676070235
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	8.170021946653765
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	6.587997894017211
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	7.681320333342031
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	3.76677680216146
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	6.738980275402986
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	4.86659297624396
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	6.264005111152078
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	7.18940103843783
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	8.226444314576842
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	6.71214925501317
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	7.12482178933287
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	9.747946221114562
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	5.3642539755232646
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	7.3440877027272125
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	5.699794289910696
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	12.771164593514968
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	8.670584862134627
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	6.400668781077284
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	9.29340559800887
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	9.526136889976984
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	5.641864710559947
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	7.678740740573821
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	7.40722981681088
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	6.29392406686359
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	8.30478913642135
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	7.214296747161281
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	7.061268010569266
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	4.728445373708568
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	9.111327682821381
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	6.795292977784591
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	7.329630624527525
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	6.938894252940077
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	7.42557734732572
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	7.0582348457766715
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	9.640066635098247
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	8.207636509097274
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	7.595118905377633
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	6.5619769443720415
We are now four months down the line.	8.552091726974446
Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS))	2.5288034876763215
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	7.705849332931391
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	6.3556491041881715
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	6.070975583479873
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	9.695249646020269
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	8.47248233939264
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	11.704524869614632
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	7.707400940889402
We want more than that, however.	11.446997968536362
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	9.023616672592398
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	6.698095247599661
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	9.643658438979921
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	5.641120187029885
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	10.894851327222876
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	10.736014583265225
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	7.503479496782969
Parliament cannot change these details.	4.969570125952707
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	7.866128636996492
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	7.115184148439771
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	6.71814489568046
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	6.468526435320918
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	4.928396474369593
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	5.751999753725609
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	5.613635588013959
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	8.658167178908998
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	6.702079302419805
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	8.76985615124162
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	7.015444777629097
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	12.702075414317624
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	6.014660003223077
This is also true of development cooperation.	15.120075315715807
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	5.479628780849799
That would not be a good thing.	5.732140018609642
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	6.699322137009667
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	8.301432878394774
But what will those limits be?	7.506799449245749
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.	6.36692054787075
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	6.956162748004127
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	6.485009313159115
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	9.213717967766673
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	7.584804291005513
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	6.343976937278462
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	6.615593513699089
There is huge duplication of effort.	4.591629492032902
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	6.360391694262025
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	5.528700412974879
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	8.57976175788978
This must be brought forward.	18.948475250112924
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	5.724144322448428
If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	5.69934715627291
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	8.33475966504283
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	7.237119224385957
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	8.101516477035183
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.7508188323455256
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	6.584671905552855
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	5.8008502787120815
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	7.045177515045009
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	6.703130685010112
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	9.324985461733046
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	8.504281864128812
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	7.177512704589402
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	9.803830089612719
For example, Mr Kreissl-D√∂rfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	9.281656577431043
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	7.365369499820885
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	9.04198127010737
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	7.653878421901711
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	7.553690243696836
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	1.0463471655630683
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	7.201559591074307
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	7.357806936727298
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	9.208580862451832
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	7.344740803520305
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	6.523534888852298
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	7.658114937891961
I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	7.434380990804174
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	8.040377449698177
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	10.290474784021272
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	7.736834508169247
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	6.752782866124557
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	7.74632906063713
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	8.852669293617067
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	7.038490089898162
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.6429848215027345
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	3.473273356103584
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	4.886492727787322
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	9.517783838430143
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	5.438720518127522
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	6.945887912273221
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	7.819309660033723
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	6.749333738432552
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	4.976562435072781
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	8.42152007170433
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	6.980693151221931
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	10.833602981225733
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	9.468096017401464
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	8.601813363843974
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	7.009738674334944
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	8.898519983610395
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	8.532614989203235
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	6.741050285298834
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	6.444362975078499
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	6.711181944388137
This will determine the success of our work.	5.021860269643663
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	8.05124878858677
This is what we need for ships.	9.300400305556128
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	12.03500854032976
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	8.06548438342698
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	6.051094894352088
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	6.4974267962362555
What do we expect from a government in any case?	10.436434660265231
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	7.594304483958234
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	6.355025685581747
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	5.3102769954870075
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	6.341825918887563
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	7.27924944756554
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	10.266669983813921
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	8.256922769149517
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	9.672330018535936
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	6.592797793257807
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	1.2370004398315835
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	5.537403451273424
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	5.909338977906047
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	7.208951693619131
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	8.185410785803077
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	6.935751308851058
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	4.583344714797452
I would urge Parliament to support them.	5.756489580558464
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' .	5.361868719084004
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	7.54670831459765
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	5.6981442767470565
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	3.4038335612872066
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	6.217412843434934
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	8.450622345076917
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	8.340836804513701
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	8.815125486131658
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	6.998700174527154
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	7.974786556745256
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	13.35763298770278
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	7.136173470448673
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	7.125837841748058
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	7.321954235493294
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	7.912482779518861
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	7.952948254433745
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	6.4068234677221785
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	5.918547954578237
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	7.520702362780533
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	9.734339445964858
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	7.538136310071714
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	8.655406940465687
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	6.89881754544042
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	5.625058148099515
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	7.901432548999576
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	6.780515073171485
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	12.270571049944936
Do we have the results of this impact study?	12.401117173181486
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	7.312154193748462
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	9.095279118176068
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	7.083935730220803
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	7.772398698473004
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	8.180731859968589
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	6.240170256468856
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	8.42829855532749
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	5.044788598842115
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	7.734606127426505
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters' fees.	8.098355389840986
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Gra√ßa Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	5.728010257588923
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	6.307128255236697
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	8.170713583973225
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	8.505473571285023
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	7.977505776216244
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	8.033576985374054
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	8.272515620670973
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	7.383624495803611
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	7.472815947431215
That is a clear complaint that we get.	13.84794780969241
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	8.683426007523016
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	6.769723286575141
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	9.035348506651232
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	8.119847797305107
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	9.71942168303561
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	8.823726552215675
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	18.131384356241714
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	9.984333932568978
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.	9.98081723627866
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	6.313760605589972
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	8.364048703202572
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	10.011557133343313
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	7.736440203532832
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	7.068335170676604
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	5.327278506540324
A third problem has been raised by Mrs D√ºhrkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	7.512254176916219
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	7.953951926219769
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	6.326215635688005
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	7.2953924157168215
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	7.091261955948525
That is positive.	1.7392189852419724
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	6.4190907652443405
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	6.900317575981927
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	8.231611089248291
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	7.5237580673466065
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	7.153818756309757
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	7.648742591424517
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	9.78323360534979
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	8.496150499016588
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	6.329124541641488
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	6.698445300816531
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	7.683415902937679
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	8.532802736241422
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	9.08767864491984
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	7.925472751794241
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	6.852976016930075
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	6.9760722222805205
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	7.247044761786926
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	7.604131447206881
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	6.641962874209771
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more r√©f√©rendaire.	8.028962636733564
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	6.540276525363558
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	6.6269324704051265
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	5.251615936049795
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	7.222843790834501
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	5.773254978188143
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	7.868272642381042
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	8.503456421525764
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	7.4191393208509915
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	6.1087088257730064
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	6.338920590962493
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	6.164616151006526
It is essential that we get the mix right.	6.82232772914162
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	7.144759333629958
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	8.118406865020184
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	5.708315946279252
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	7.464042497942849
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	6.796698925431503
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	6.7423483918943194
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	4.131755402193311
Do not continue in this vein!	11.401495629314823
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	6.122784994232339
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	8.434733404380355
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	5.379861625011112
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	6.913883204972725
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	5.853629569732105
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vend√©e since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	7.113304020928164
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	10.372258034294969
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	8.523287874950952
We want to bring this across in Parliament.	9.428811321496577
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	7.981310553244139
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	7.826520871615795
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	9.393049024318017
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	6.293986663368439
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	8.419150274616403
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	6.396958731880024
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	7.929241824421912
On the contrary.	16.92448979219979
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	7.204141795056597
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	8.262832678002662
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	6.221427885830098
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	6.219435867207528
I do not have these concerns.	18.125134117812237
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	7.0028528248287
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	7.295222720600007
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	7.446973177255493
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	9.733325519711963
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	6.710694526595437
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	5.5252202203274985
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	5.995386644287567
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	6.021719423411358
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	4.512065315134413
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	7.189845125010649
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	9.010208287810865
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	6.8950422545146735
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	6.717863399823531
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	12.398549445180459
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	8.594316017712458
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	7.259384431742611
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	8.941668266208985
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	7.47115994314605
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	1.2264779583237335
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	9.73572621758106
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	7.541550138264814
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	6.016483338341133
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	6.987034782002568
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	6.122752180727281
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	6.473595083170722
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	6.673265469424592
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	7.387106869188189
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	7.796159341073595
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	6.476844957091608
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	6.611128974489812
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	6.648724343020734
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	8.061033731079004
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	7.877421075283538
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	11.912314786869953
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	7.3198170147478745
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	8.479826598864761
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	7.128196371777281
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	5.896577179794346
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	7.649801890874631
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	7.8522118440529045
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	8.541187628799053
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	11.630553129415066
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	5.895964423142596
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	6.8440775700570855
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	6.527563526992089
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	8.14422000779327
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	7.433145079136595
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	7.399212148618559
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	6.103488736607846
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	9.280376825975596
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	9.190596660311709
It is also a matter of conviction.	9.589281934843221
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	7.938033852982395
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	5.1893092746433185
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	6.385511175266354
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	7.610113885939232
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	7.962277168501863
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	5.06047242502871
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	6.208196693834285
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	7.7182083391676235
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	5.8337013868042416
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	8.030336901740991
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	14.78355531293206
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	6.699905432940894
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	8.116833490508638
A man with three children and he was murdered.	5.461737414049138
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)	4.130770665024858
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	5.421349551274427
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	7.734217776030394
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	6.735674127466348
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	5.837964037964173
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	11.989313610858169
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	7.168679865566642
	14.22659668727896
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	9.3173544599452
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	5.342458211207857
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	8.399421321120112
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	8.794261968087325
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	7.412808950775448
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	6.999235261505217
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	7.094199426187034
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	5.485412510221666
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	7.843064480616383
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	8.553970205250593
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	7.491118572241683
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	8.09660015595624
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge D√≠ez.	3.663763272176677
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	8.88011354307071
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	6.683281830260393
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	7.710895894923626
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	9.781167085301725
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	10.085996468850443
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	5.886853703105362
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	7.499966710431207
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	5.867528669191821
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	9.196760288936618
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	9.090915647112773
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	5.326029241493284
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	8.694597309245811
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	9.216615913009964
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	7.552978229282864
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	7.033853155916483
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, √Ålvaro de Soto.	7.800198812061069
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	6.049041676172138
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	8.022446238988163
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	6.111326156646284
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	7.985474666061216
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	10.192688040281206
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	6.992641646793465
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	8.304232444224224
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting.	6.441712888899979
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	7.556762390656737
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	7.4676075467778995
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	11.002934560665258
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	12.10220542833106
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	8.890538130275251
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	8.011650044572221
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	9.637074067030065
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	7.830606334328131
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	5.9628348782132905
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	7.7205243393354595
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	11.82811140193392
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	8.911524322040174
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	7.752448108618854
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	7.914525323206584
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	2.4849492576712944
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	8.325004659781078
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	7.421045177061174
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	8.674013736844111
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	8.623178027187315
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	8.341469062012033
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	6.822100155469517
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	5.669375445296164
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	8.189959230611825
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	6.690935703237385
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	9.1329048887244
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	6.42824440771761
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource.	9.74557944199786
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	6.892737102701598
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vend√©e are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	4.6457583653817895
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	8.133491293856633
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	6.349036580365333
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	9.108754036726422
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	8.72826857188162
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	7.2001726975060265
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	7.995774791967128
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	7.069149628635815
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	7.3294436261660945
You can be what you want to be.	11.119694150371735
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	7.1194948320812745
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lom√©.	7.685332491735512
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	7.760955776505499
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	6.885798290770963
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	5.509980561992961
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	8.741428914494703
This is a true example of the Council' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	10.873310871143175
The postal services are important.	10.323681351487593
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	7.636298609538589
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	8.281831886761372
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	8.406765956480392
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	7.935044517336457
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	7.472128419985509
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	7.941831656380138
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	7.523562855343332
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	6.262001974729656
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	6.853578905719695
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	6.545712042792934
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	7.706892164359956
I am, however, optimistic.	19.258224684333353
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	7.317677935713869
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	7.8088313005883165
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	7.938592665266833
I hope that we can thrash this out.	7.639466687075723
Both of them have done a first-class job.	8.30048371979593
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	8.055739693347926
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	6.1238387382842925
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	7.297121242649849
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	6.968689832888859
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	5.5147979915840235
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	9.019667549185016
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	7.162872559025055
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	8.408455768634838
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	9.012413080685226
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	7.580566613642495
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	6.240397102805975
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	9.730849256710403
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	9.790622030757604
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	7.402715436261568
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	7.5118645615428425
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	8.013446617014745
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	8.035508554067386
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	6.439300746651611
The debate is a deeply political one.	13.034791157356887
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	7.825586266347604
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	9.63054346987186
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	6.610304687702646
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	11.132766088556393
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	4.903828622949458
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	8.326804770374128
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	8.197977143149016
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	6.77678694777145
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	7.427015134494017
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	7.470191383158435
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	7.38960671625243
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	6.425616168193387
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	7.938384237033405
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	6.8851871424219375
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	6.64584281727371
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	8.297236283961013
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	7.734896242191682
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	7.661704003655473
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	8.850969352234598
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	8.225050014146943
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	7.807968020919231
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	6.6980084697488405
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	7.973929753905802
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	8.716716091275732
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	8.661808171639022
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lom√© I and Lom√© VI.	6.934276631764451
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	9.33384086834928
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	11.122327228916278
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	6.293093919302065
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	6.09740894377234
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	6.794050965325524
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	11.090729052695032
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	9.168208712144107
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	7.748129151466816
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	8.850719445796445
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	7.819252672110309
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	7.951290810060455
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	6.046115472675532
. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	7.070176169149676
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	7.568978328273236
.	52.89722204958655
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	6.8321605846073
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	7.392182982456816
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	8.449685619554522
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	8.004983224920231
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	6.177997949536989
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	6.970720318103824
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.	7.509067632238076
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad?	8.177988179921602
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	7.789197910562222
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	6.333982557694255
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	7.7615323161378384
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	6.701739841550068
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	6.506891958809915
Do we have any figures?	16.639636582295683
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	6.900060121361583
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	7.99693475558708
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	6.234233387593474
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	7.648312139761746
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	7.561222607616114
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments.	10.329648488964452
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	6.747566303004978
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	6.906916894315281
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	9.644345834117068
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	6.569855937912881
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-√†-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	10.214788359392077
Let me give you three examples.	5.980542915127674
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	7.728329162379345
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	7.719662893174543
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	6.998106627284345
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	8.51653572457542
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	7.405113530854164
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	8.427906512301586
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	8.788486471385802
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	7.879863328731652
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	6.0428384205632115
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	6.032209128234872
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	10.068281451851092
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	6.9027513843390045
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	7.558549154807148
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	5.658240414451283
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	6.2285369177769825
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	9.438475603735377
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	8.72018820693203
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	7.531231629735841
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	7.580705731536875
.	52.89722204958655
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	9.213665188201968
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	8.42084843561732
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	6.545478040115789
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	8.391063380471687
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	6.721004861146953
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	8.066344297443646
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	6.228829449640762
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	7.332613320654949
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	7.667402460512004
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	10.750583055677941
The environment is in a parlous state.	16.146674030904844
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	5.5081529248982815
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	7.567158658273915
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	5.5979929798496935
We need to open that debate.	22.34566636273774
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	7.198771207820748
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	5.468230164846915
There is time.	8.22841094937763
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	7.510347368299642
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	5.727574753684011
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	5.678612501147744
(Applause from the PSE Group)	2.689926333551363
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	5.254370728728748
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	8.419774925596228
We are therefore all to blame.	10.644734815307157
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	7.00733399153645
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	7.256173218801868
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	7.961452937297586
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	7.395090593986653
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	5.396253230907856
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	5.793175323801086
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	9.005480723037147
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	8.003222024482893
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	10.528575854437136
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	6.2632610218533324
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	5.410358362773305
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	5.607207479699679
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	5.963124494933992
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	9.645928863554238
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	5.72589688879848
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	6.455498629645165
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	7.638647289175444
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	7.439309295413756
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	7.162051517121474
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	8.541581963423843
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	8.029854214100604
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	6.632783019094679
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	6.678956101676733
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	6.1741814566852895
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	7.451555564639366
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	6.058710053974152
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	7.131979449879264
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	9.332863656470733
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	7.4603976928351425
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	9.089665605189468
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	6.5066968616790986
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	6.797423192867837
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	6.503509144680353
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	7.897314279445038
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	7.575447529526597
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	8.247562697076171
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	4.56160955401285
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	7.190707604301553
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	7.056400079588484
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	8.722935631657176
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	6.522408559556665
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	6.790852521829083
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	6.793060641372652
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	8.937529956233767
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	7.564578557219527
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	7.027225085217288
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	8.033945231781507
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	5.527557039100718
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	8.449042920445649
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	6.324486173782024
The common fisheries policy is not working.	6.0219015743625555
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	7.193733626912283
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	1.1438227504289553
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	6.384864356073711
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	7.705324600879728
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	7.93087127010922
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	8.907656152471054
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	7.676614993702068
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	7.729056113137796
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	7.2256161895500375
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	11.390246121003463
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	6.246836625149499
Five months are provided for this.	6.439021105821469
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	8.85532544338911
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	11.064803180949411
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	8.804232330936067
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	8.982862926363964
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	9.483571812188604
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	7.727240353388164
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	6.801068059607724
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lom√© Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	5.181560406474423
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	13.773942930127765
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	3.421644602298383
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	7.810537493882058
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	7.561140056133743
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	8.438181470456403
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	9.373584280482307
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	4.5041885796300205
Resumption of the session	1.9337498405317024
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	7.383759005119043
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	8.158362217034732
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	7.503667842577393
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	7.489103562736489
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	6.34894958084611
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	7.985284953237277
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	7.677740290589448
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	6.65875215196373
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	8.26554209823635
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	6.635838395610951
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	6.503529464867947
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	5.8631985935502335
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	7.419704380458806
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.950873842651714
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	8.359627399248529
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	6.692073376395322
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	6.961106991907596
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	5.566083278542302
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	6.278591799679606
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	7.109284347608034
.	52.89722204958655
I think they should have.	8.065200044158733
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	9.248638577640252
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	6.801240251194323
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	10.161642901807832
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)	1.9165492068665972
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	7.4388098912476694
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	9.595117320055337
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	10.321867961205589
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	7.25148976268411
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	7.064807872789306
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	9.094553201480737
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	7.882555543464368
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	8.360883138459139
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	5.462023053121766
The Commission does not have enough staff.	7.159546359355622
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	7.319434704942629
The maritime world has great potential.	3.182297978916214
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	9.740054537413064
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	8.556891240063791
We are extremely disappointed.	8.613171938670561
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	4.893826455729223
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	7.78229758534096
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	8.630144204629257
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	9.072268087435967
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	6.4034461253999
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	7.858198940286151
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	7.294362785890595
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	6.46577074204945
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	8.090885990493575
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	6.127302727011932
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	7.149091570806979
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	6.335239035233669
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	8.345946044380852
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	7.897306460988707
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	5.205146839115509
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	8.21685676427983
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	8.844081655613053
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	8.762086397136143
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	5.0437159384709105
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	9.729302745731225
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	8.752281332626856
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	5.16288251106036
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	7.505387520859793
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	6.453806964020233
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	6.556153262076739
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	6.0265161327858054
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	7.065954365304117
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	6.550228968280351
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	5.695523146673199
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	12.215795982660143
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	7.520599742529395
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	6.746681817278894
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	7.7430152101048115
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	8.613501148788686
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	6.285881204437382
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	8.708176228427355
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	8.098676628008366
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	5.069229174868388
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	7.617794495662726
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	8.626648718688873
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	7.682116430849335
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	6.133207571288473
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	7.463484537299498
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	7.320561113588381
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	8.503909949830813
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	8.38058836626766
The Commission' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage' .	7.998716017440956
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	8.081024638640327
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	4.75247984085294
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	7.178346668843623
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	5.343904498809103
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	8.339211074587318
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	7.723929234046082
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	5.8427939277045455
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	7.40602220664748
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	5.820058941129749
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	6.417740464962517
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	4.689539026142353
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	5.5419247392317805
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	6.801375006349388
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	7.112202989800112
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	7.0196974599368325
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	6.604019957922117
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	6.658944724503809
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	7.94627911421915
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	8.10702063895825
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	7.396881409617047
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	5.831759921741548
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	8.353153941861951
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	5.49079143233031
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	8.281352717766445
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	7.425248047710772
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	1.2264779583237335
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	6.999405281793139
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	4.897092372498375
Employment is growing at a good rate.	6.6981638823691725
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	6.757012505768473
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	8.513198426037846
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	7.8292614438569705
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	8.31615671036841
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	6.935381372524016
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	6.190590852478116
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	6.818722716945452
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	9.49087650810881
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	7.274115959528525
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	6.865789503197931
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	8.079112220188195
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	6.063984795207994
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	8.695086028939574
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	7.682699686046379
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	6.511044830251113
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	10.217250769515294
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	9.036916681483646
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	7.128394843649439
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	6.499444587599985
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	6.815921008748427
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	7.803233734526395
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	9.294424041330767
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	7.217872654942549
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	8.752324630720008
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	5.692654694880501
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	6.246371903873167
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	5.479313414063401
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	5.931973359790326
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	10.519318548685181
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	8.508939582623432
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	8.378759913734852
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	7.02119488558034
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	6.852095406479726
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	4.951152577820081
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	5.818271582671182
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	6.188454280937659
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	8.682646383579835
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	7.44297515404797
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	6.848724847397025
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	9.74936709739399
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	7.835176504470118
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	7.821605796633621
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	9.353713637278377
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	6.069334666225871
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	7.184441712468609
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	7.854495991859434
That is why it is so important.	4.397806930701729
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	7.058919266686427
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	8.695980093775438
Do not take too long to send it back.	8.414510981197633
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	7.400569571811308
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	7.302992221463038
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	7.20428346921443
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	6.733232518856504
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	7.502663994604124
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	8.655949133890559
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	5.92268033496855
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	5.7126126597998015
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	9.614820309214236
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	7.867249944736809
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	6.971775059070023
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	7.09573929894257
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	8.908109589168628
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	7.871095715999036
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	9.060718057437747
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	8.662400688474184
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	6.555672412034233
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	6.30952990711059
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	8.361732988870505
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	5.208842930814814
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	7.752027878681069
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	7.696209505974869
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	7.8581253913050455
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	8.51467686433045
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	6.399438958323881
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	7.527152542997004
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	9.134847262604715
This is part of risk management.	7.695862574031597
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	8.293190922042191
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	6.34760446929726
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	6.900013803086469
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	5.400027008833794
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	6.114457157596697
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	6.163594790215525
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	9.003785113970617
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	7.501733580154024
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	7.9880068805554
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	7.201394073575591
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	8.076193883186036
It must be visible.	6.094301926144696
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	4.967146083168798
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	10.288895113843916
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	4.523117285872499
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	7.112053544854012
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	7.878609485312105
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	6.256520107736773
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	5.957062730078096
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	6.59309935888998
CULTURE 2000	14.163546821312059
This is a big problem in my opinion.	20.174240593987786
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	6.54686804687535
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	6.0587131284072635
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	7.5853484439643095
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	10.403509034525099
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	8.103030137261866
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	4.794592090370548
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	7.583622907017044
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	12.446170551718383
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	8.443458912700867
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	7.691008736743775
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	3.298962568157464
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	9.992000019825193
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	8.120190800881856
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	7.6165475438652335
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	7.169525911367944
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	7.844674670641004
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	7.702954361120812
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	6.8570379089481
We all took part in it, not just one group.	8.25044041019051
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	7.692590770198922
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	9.991426920533815
Is this not a contradiction?	11.257277788924341
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	6.584502387034475
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	8.149186639586837
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	6.981085840568176
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	7.389671770258491
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	7.514857207519506
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	6.26807719557357
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	10.548723908845261
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	6.39212948407666
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	1.7355261356688754
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	7.555568092411626
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	7.486002870996177
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	7.611988109730122
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	5.944459364870393
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	8.811231692840757
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	6.342266015096988
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	5.776779029139146
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	5.007469454685115
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	5.950934226976078
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	5.2646051044228575
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	7.969286901507456
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	3.5938372946619617
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	6.633948826647172
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	6.4107903237732655
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	7.375394335627429
-	14.22659668727896
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	7.365398031342662
But all is not lost.	6.141687452374618
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	4.564852039865232
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	8.418668651663486
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	7.2477995429595
Shipwreck of the Erika	1.9010414406552534
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	9.35455482697233
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	7.7210878188258985
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	8.597827360174128
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	10.063635934241415
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	6.014617343909403
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	8.27310240472388
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	4.508600539709044
We therefore have a number of amendments.	9.37414892547495
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	7.196910727920999
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	5.268197568030926
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	8.64025881059258
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	7.145610421556071
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	9.34135168949275
The Commission must continue along these lines.	11.463472278626204
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	7.767859271833924
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	4.87518175928275
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	7.155525548770649
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	7.616938508639612
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	9.079960198131063
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	7.384045186505951
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gas√≤liba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	7.2620627995691125
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	9.32640851278872
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	6.728562760032891
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	7.4683294637820055
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	7.177895925544498
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	4.866078920470865
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	7.119705527211155
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	7.278058480654459
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	7.796156584708462
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	10.94891414885176
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	6.865489392690995
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	5.178867903897759
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	3.428206411514358
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	5.846983989304311
The consequences do not inspire hope.	5.90019874524547
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	10.453323936304555
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	5.536366564857733
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	8.291332712773315
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	13.308996582873515
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Kn√∂rr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	8.0313026390394
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	6.650350176226303
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	8.119669068194426
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	7.347095065460939
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	8.431120800814575
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	6.986915821907864
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	8.299305268157669
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	6.541343092200564
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	8.604358459034009
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	5.848072320954318
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	7.698207821283357
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	1.1438227504289553
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	8.559329657916884
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	10.481061563878553
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	9.779585630768088
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	5.140834007767609
There is effective legal precaution.	6.472186945409675
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	8.885345529803471
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	5.060352688515281
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	6.469921311850395
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	8.975061739427348
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	6.397291209045606
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	6.530857919376203
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	5.597778092658841
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	7.428618757383614
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	7.5470054917857645
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	7.913899664047655
Report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS))	2.4073503993796463
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	5.711698600019007
My next question, Mrs Wallstr√∂m, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	8.685692542696044
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	6.851424602767064
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	6.2727283670732055
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	7.87411167681149
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	8.375638721334036
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	6.264018673203833
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	8.232652910832112
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	7.190069943072736
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	5.7022301400250335
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	6.375527839164622
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	5.966627197678046
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	8.360627631556333
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	6.906700349564156
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	18.991548286777736
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	7.184749910066371
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	7.955068105772359
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	7.481659515437355
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	3.614359915757066
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	9.333099252773275
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	10.471137886415029
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	9.45300772473671
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	8.405837133096982
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	4.855295363321445
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	7.98481323947653
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	7.492358367322883
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	6.471545241266232
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	8.67298509558076
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	7.178668853572328
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	5.356578297180935
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.	6.629403163108397
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	7.792208894970746
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	6.1065219941145275
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	7.774632304144384
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	8.63240430767697
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	7.236570370345336
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	7.682342316912204
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	6.663990357356958
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	7.857796539237404
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	9.832118877325449
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	7.568802641317992
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	9.71232445189247
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.8158169272617581
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	7.342696613069972
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	7.370782688023123
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	7.503768588190155
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	9.086955150534951
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	5.116413304714832
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	8.274962039616266
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	5.9955396083830665
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	6.187071229532295
The second point relates to Syria.	5.219290602505499
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	8.093753473654937
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	15.025981318537891
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth' s sake.	8.91104552360563
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	8.945594566129142
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	6.561001294505908
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	6.210478485463464
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	8.062823261540895
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	5.602972137558773
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	8.123718249546878
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	6.573367677461682
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	6.850282923607997
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	7.279980463611769
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	9.870352251294534
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	6.811642872037795
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	9.365673827280528
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	9.330036577481854
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	6.019955472947233
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	7.4165505951048845
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	8.712269557326778
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	6.09767315890078
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	8.38890542536434
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grosset√™te on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	2.7026434395017356
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	7.035569101711239
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	8.874942964573233
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	5.262620162639327
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	5.825895388848023
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	9.433594028591246
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	8.969846602491364
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	7.81688572103297
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	5.997460444925481
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	9.51974977548193
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	7.12185873997826
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	8.968347561126246
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	6.087529856980889
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	9.208298942592116
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	5.330695179369415
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	9.890288072911382
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	9.326166625542145
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	7.954263566140373
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	7.2353241284914755
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	6.339212349713219
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	9.020625279476622
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	9.09601681287677
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict.	10.409913768730787
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	9.774652328566066
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	9.90703126614543
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	8.228689727932709
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	10.193670263285604
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	7.776554675188977
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	7.406940556185528
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	6.3618263085511675
This is good, but it is not enough.	4.135748557225785
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	8.844302869656675
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	7.715421402185696
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	6.239525570700263
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	6.514189090460326
I am very fond of him.	11.256523782577764
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	5.305022553634398
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	4.20247235425042
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	5.307311326115118
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	6.91623653002239
I consider the casting of J√∂rg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	6.913743585031744
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	5.995449544080946
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	6.198661871583479
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	4.715508683653782
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	8.862544474336607
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	9.125032932230786
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	7.163583369418491
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	7.632240694912438
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	5.514474524675455
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	7.598573239489684
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	9.381692344076452
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	6.839699127976558
This, however, does not seem feasible.	7.5260698845113865
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	6.494895844869577
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	5.667345790150517
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	8.707898977679092
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	7.572393985717006
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	9.871596482354091
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	7.859729412077075
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	8.00911792540705
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	3.9608210544479796
It is clear from statements over the past years that J√∂rg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	5.867264879926049
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	8.341562181424012
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	8.452503199086163
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	8.484748100429071
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	7.009924581250575
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	6.01105363585725
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	7.531763082505092
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	8.164790935073047
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	3.304287553555707
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	9.42084953163375
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	7.371571093236914
These aspects are very much interconnected.	7.456373120004237
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	8.266472210960279
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	6.968536294376514
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	6.4559115862529985
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	8.8032668067661
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	7.987157928632848
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	6.8760922297864955
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	7.581248138766906
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	8.644316819397751
(Applause, heckling)	17.253139367785742
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	1.1438227504289553
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	7.8421711416179125
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	8.152887221759835
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	7.493812081546338
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	9.698231368680066
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	8.937593654026943
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	9.138772083196018
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	5.216041266516861
Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	8.189678495825657
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	9.123632187467424
So what are we to do now?	2.627268538324133
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	8.74894753421893
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	10.868415027060411
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	5.514952652245169
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	8.403307668352458
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	7.700291330555851
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	7.261518441423618
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	7.472397297883058
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	6.611230847448729
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	9.12926996262905
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	6.069400151075421
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	1.7860706392370067
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	8.451536390242417
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	8.160515042219135
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	7.900039129815064
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	6.856293747889163
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	7.692346330954887
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	5.9339591184737674
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	6.288633299244166
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	8.8068250958544
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	11.129026846259178
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	13.327647357962734
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lom√© Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	8.486912931298576
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	7.791410872819591
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	9.067152097294832
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	8.50553765113216
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	9.475220589900012
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	7.847441797837834
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	8.569765385127797
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	6.2959837213695975
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	3.0032133620144443
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	7.255972362292105
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	6.732852055121303
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	6.3735297350635935
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	6.104306789316402
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	7.088322103746432
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	8.55846772792442
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	8.059159965001363
I am especially grateful for all of this.	7.611100981765804
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	8.620574868413968
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	6.2263576500198905
This issue is extremely topical.	7.77861987851719
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	8.914492084124948
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	6.678524722142734
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	8.001492594866953
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	1.2264779583237335
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	6.4619299292507435
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	8.166855313414638
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	7.507162022167707
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	3.906701127685746
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	8.697341446406273
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	4.497710699577277
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	6.954428878851639
Agreement on comitology	23.404981888394214
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	7.297746323620411
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	7.514271939720155
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	5.989696588258426
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	8.279714665108562
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	11.003975628297662
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	7.801771417870695
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	7.952573107738964
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	7.898867408044284
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	6.083629731210332
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	8.411412929102132
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	6.578769699860616
This has been talked about for years.	10.402645780682862
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	9.500306639871193
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	8.410048807213625
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	10.821739350729427
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of d√©j√† vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	8.452152343014658
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	8.299973567691403
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	6.9321864056728035
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	10.808942774816808
This is my first point regarding the policy.	4.831857508576206
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	7.361905094439735
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	8.301378629285999
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	6.329890807904806
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	4.865154637304672
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	6.474992521015302
.	52.89722204958655
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	8.24910520453736
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	6.477865474253177
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	7.100017866955809
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	7.430201235629067
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	6.11733540760777
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	6.625574164696662
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	8.316532867143504
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	8.872380550675851
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	6.069937980969806
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	9.022829702126803
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	6.757575271061838
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	7.761358552773216
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	7.274021313355709
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	7.512332278620588
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	7.32304153306372
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	7.106730295094062
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	3.0267946991993075
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	7.745795352837046
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	8.550203640883183
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .	7.57715623988513
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	6.992396611542986
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	8.205218335021177
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	7.910633348495499
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	5.478214405770335
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	7.115447525232815
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.4432914396729326
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	5.746904710434006
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	6.786929466188778
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	6.560668701179399
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	8.132283408866547
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	14.680195979934748
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	9.282050400626158
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	6.0754547690215315
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.6429848215027345
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	6.932690801454224
Mr R√ºbig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	7.614233593899357
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	8.536966349395158
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	6.607407627215725
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	6.739728440882283
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	8.767276734490318
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	8.382512560414854
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	7.405176574184868
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	5.982081438589066
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	6.095488676921951
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	7.61120325541494
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	6.179142461259196
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	5.4184878611275895
This I think is the new Convention.	10.033952266245123
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	5.400154279413066
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	6.729428303431263
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	10.084348200820143
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	7.77014621969072
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	5.416462837624613
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	7.435468443129205
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	6.753163875683786
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	6.850274961813348
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	8.534154900099294
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	7.245410018312703
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	7.188818710861514
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	4.9551262971104055
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	7.041458914407217
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	8.931052329306988
These are my three questions.	5.391676919239192
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	9.398269595213712
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	5.791264976088962
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	7.077065167057744
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	10.786943672338248
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	5.2359688901197075
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	7.4837456859695415
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	6.285398558980234
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	11.63176346278732
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	6.8129074002465835
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	7.834519534528059
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	7.886926217481383
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	7.9675395801510485
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	12.991779824401622
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	8.370735380035438
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	6.2597596030273825
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	5.617427951643474
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.815216997521294
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	9.144251477718006
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	7.293846850075163
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	5.088860847267493
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	6.723844019305257
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	8.851395317547858
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	6.289469828775672
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	10.506067537017485
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	7.746804405740281
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	8.207108001283338
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	7.603457686037901
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	11.436031112685894
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	7.411419989646284
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	6.690572991573051
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	8.438613300991392
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	7.9056665274166
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	6.186318693413358
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	9.375217652186707
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	6.631878093794707
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	8.444168764904493
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	8.055804414050023
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	7.8172028433738525
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	7.610852207184274
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	7.713849907376651
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	8.886701643082358
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	9.355392087472008
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	7.692399627021506
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	4.342525545947415
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	5.882274041930238
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	6.130694117912427

Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	8.20341287431943
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	8.363219328217744
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	8.582110425073946
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	8.951598077645189
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	5.120332463447947
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	8.473319568049504
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	6.956629322640697
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	7.138167832472209
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	7.154857111142049
I refer to point 9.	14.367595478645294
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	9.600645104839936
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	4.256077155399981
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	7.435323559718836
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	12.382970787966292
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	6.306211744894132
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	7.092969850784102
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	11.212528938228214
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	8.011917553972419
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	4.1207032048569046
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	6.372009691662737
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	7.352302586054351
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	7.16643424601193
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	5.325854442007747
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	6.762511545045018
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	6.727811063796162
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	7.848509469332853
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	5.010411967082586
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	4.828530727293388
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	8.718903110961563
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	7.251551740526726
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	8.400172608336467
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	8.13566185116734
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	4.775434945779203
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	7.665463566255489
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	10.208583343437683
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	5.812927671433932
This is a major task.	22.04995149795443
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	7.3989954023394215
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	9.998561171814236
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	6.870716434010558
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	7.090927008086193
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	6.579086178865727
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	6.881819479994107
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	8.023902957249732
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.	7.347831511617702
This is not in question.	14.696326175350533
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	7.248381120905173
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	7.092271411776972
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	9.027965112914858
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	7.728506917475224
The moment of truth is approaching.	4.291589509535276
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	9.804175114185217
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	6.815243581767417
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention.	7.932508646711215
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	7.743148351754828
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	5.80771172746266
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	6.175202286683338
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	5.684185460080178
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	4.611531636328608
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	6.77530575259384
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	8.546705993137772
On this we are clear.	5.703993024229287
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	9.112393461492388
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	6.259428915034365
Resumption of the session	1.9337498405317024
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	7.870509442561308
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	7.922417847074359
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	9.787643270835984
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	7.8961078752748906
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	8.50202033732149
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	7.733681930631479
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	7.4801674968955245
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	7.875375081678714
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)).	2.2859233372801198
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	5.786366140539322
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	7.420688710045277
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	9.282596108479485
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	6.724222708285611
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	5.737214825405725
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	6.970510344572779
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	6.14517570360017
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	7.9896477849432275
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	8.047757898858585
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	6.977388991064401
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	9.466248725783517
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	8.197114369430984
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	8.64283224865017
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	7.8449133403583655
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	6.986137745081486
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	9.201212724581621
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	7.404668611515317
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	6.305304486279954
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	8.279682221625688
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	11.169627569118983
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	8.91142643343655
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	11.028018596338345
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	7.085136822357934
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	6.577371688644757
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	7.193474774973992
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	5.332479974150698
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	8.152503163425905
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	7.4511972821995816
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	9.264344834937795
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	9.547498206534387
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	15.805374148778114
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	7.404660758107957
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	7.497314459754182
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	7.648679959542572
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	6.790489665736681
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	5.128361603286878
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	6.3552025197448705
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	9.712110859752023
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	8.575212705808273
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	6.272119031318235
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	8.632472596182962
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	7.592139353900259
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	9.815199368789196
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	7.3863933176285625
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	7.698738802189653
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	5.731815905663843
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	7.906967469770934
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	7.860503701521415
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	6.792768423582097
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	5.017876770910391
Scrapie	14.22659668727896
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	6.522197614202799
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	8.962114996850755
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	7.725553710372076
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	5.7802714173016065
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	7.181408221567896
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	5.3205020114256545
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	6.974699644798713
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	8.265403762723107
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	9.511980315608435
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	7.230844405380396
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	11.361258187536512
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	7.159594937873813
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	9.541045964313716
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	7.668021067439309
The joint debate is closed.	2.116534418917134
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	9.106989116432365
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	5.953309990196973
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	9.798169621423089
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	11.311166507359873
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	5.769882886929541
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	5.090613041208919
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	8.344543409150281
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	7.419839911355529
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	6.909708646149976
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	7.404968622249729
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	7.187378954357602
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	7.778733398975607
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	7.3174105228069894
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	7.2323079580530925
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	7.906186883226049
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	7.460410012380672
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	6.625337369749773
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	5.711141629502222
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	6.614682843562112
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	7.58621843624168
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	7.776481040587688
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	7.263595010069516
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	5.6006951909472305
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	5.098062648037296
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	9.003943700373314
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	7.719843587641213
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	6.446802459570678
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	8.511165694741283
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	6.9017133259788634
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	9.864964213314996
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	8.688056162757158
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	5.481533997840181
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	8.322016643087759
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	9.150490182056277
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	6.539647841099627
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	7.850699238515923
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	7.059110433843446
This has not just happened.	8.728072287088889
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	8.86657178958243
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	6.684979114926562
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	6.211311378723604
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	7.795877346321424
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	5.701753263513686
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	7.266364585472032
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	7.433584561204661
He is a dangerous man.	12.37857109828805
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	7.812455005803392
Is this too much of a burden?	6.776723558140721
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	7.301493171187152
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	7.335195807676145
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	5.2558209191917955
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	7.8649688642841165
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	7.755143933729699
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	5.8968453892025625
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	7.340625320275822
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	9.844704907255924
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	11.130021103539862
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	2.4453948003881547
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	7.319129478769973
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	6.258298709416019
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	7.059669125990164
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	8.527432095727685
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	5.860456123969598
The first concerns this Parliament.	8.09711060205068
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	7.38500339275246
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	7.26163278897797
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	8.750408764979257
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.3261229296644093
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	7.264969673121423
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	5.713592285404295
It is nothing less than legal torture.	4.693976780431208
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	5.803894734902865
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	8.608581414565364
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	10.00981457185145
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	7.130908816048761
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal.	6.221966559680513
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.	5.557586141049466
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	7.519140875242232
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	9.441528529244469
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	3.6315713759326207
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	7.15060678747576
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	7.199636630946802
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	7.257477577435818
I would urge you to endorse this.	4.9515295161668895
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	8.664703168842744
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	6.129126511389478
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	7.904430817267923
rapporteur.	52.89722204958655
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	7.9295685434802055
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	9.386333650485867
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	8.121140788182307
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	8.788578531584918
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	7.8125955183031115
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	7.197849703728083
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	8.523328407029318
These cases keep occurring.	3.8784604182427382
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	8.957533964614987
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	7.597201553855238
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	6.361321903157487
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	7.58753234895902
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	6.555018920510218
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	8.2199805318995
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	8.656069234607445
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	7.520383856930776
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	7.4828570646736186
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	9.928019309530066
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	8.274464684000934
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	7.138152779537462
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	9.450404206772332
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	6.7831851138251285
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	10.771384624589563
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	7.469663059434469
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	7.588747838342996
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	6.557580640775682
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	5.793036637942462
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	6.085727460500165
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	7.937316502276319
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	7.279450397056837
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	9.069191611292291
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	8.074009822819024
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	2.671870117601472
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	7.970847199353649
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	7.918120024833187
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	5.651883063360031
I want to emphasise four points.	12.317000894718564
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	6.8687168395766856
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	7.476381169038069
That is the one word I am talking about.	10.826266594393381
It also creates protection for software and databases.	6.292989888837498
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	4.925388001590614
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	7.882881914733431
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	2.270666966225702
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	8.533030363839861
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	4.837910403567906
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	8.85391911914227
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	7.951517962410387
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	10.283432099486758
Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	7.729645315508111
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	7.688862436630573
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	6.224126637973269
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	7.5838094745487945
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	9.470726278051316
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	6.438769844352262
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	6.0627891956399
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	6.344749555849008
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	8.173598644475867
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	7.749889718304075
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	6.281701895925862
That concludes the vote	4.581525361616099
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	6.123233383685934
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	7.4163809814094295
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	7.8831944558004405
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	6.01694091623768
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	7.851361263027748
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	5.78447018509335
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	8.459936354945834
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	9.234918096679795
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	7.859864730839803
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	5.482399815727642
That is the reality.	60.95167214525851
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	8.079942331689653
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	9.030405021702066
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	7.188794065844581
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	8.335958481830223
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	8.453478555849552
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	8.529095410246548
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	7.579811495006448
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	9.533713882506001
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	9.218491284936391
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	7.271396390961818
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	6.114708530412873
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	6.916359987327358
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	8.079444618375115
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	5.03679398401111
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	6.7422167960293935
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	9.440914299516963
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	8.201801337176317
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	9.540901191691773
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	6.296767040638573
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	12.303614909890237
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	7.037937391120285
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	5.656461593419552
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	8.32835860421609
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	9.429818979533403
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob S√∂derman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	8.173331118980837
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	6.367544238784838
What should we do with the shredded products?	8.329004493042016
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	9.07423844401925
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	8.848140420756325
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	9.845546896081052
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	7.02173122069082
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	8.895689941338526
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	7.633757545312906
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	3.796889423293463
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	11.081097987592244
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	6.422119516489788
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	8.064580397664779
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	7.585122612940194
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	6.200569660140977
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	5.980168840971942
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	8.066994085761735
We have taken good note of your intentions.	9.528562498664467
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	5.302352723553094
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	5.850384816319359
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	9.230220269566187
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	7.863029969632527
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	8.30721704854093
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	9.186016992464948
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	5.868895435844243
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	8.655235916898615
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	8.34372528112374
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	5.342425685816715
I will keep myself free in this connection.	6.540530519414055
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	7.189165854596212
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	5.3788078188972515
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	7.794713644888088
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	8.27092311707762
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	8.89793893250767
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	5.554910202297627
Women have different individual needs and interests.	5.508323809089965
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	6.222716234128878
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	8.095712835977343
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	6.568065962596918
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	5.81586983945566
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	9.509174930803406
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.274287386284098
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	1.2264779583237335
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	5.869279078489988
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	8.061003440204974
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	6.124067542145162
Firstly, for the single market.	12.342913740351113
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	8.110788436017783
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	6.075447188059992
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	6.707685538415269
VOTE (continuation)	1.2533927271027994
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	8.443219148501202
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	10.664832041569138
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	6.796682413152449
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	7.51282219240191
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	7.238602426196391
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	6.32076080844995
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	2.0232282846774647
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	6.970464426709447
This report is about the Commission.	13.883918170377367
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	7.671882338613706
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	7.6974196419780885
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	8.689392703295995
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.	6.049825337604513
.	52.89722204958655
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	6.369912264514196
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	8.300531089164126
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	9.441794111123448
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	8.340510298586315
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	7.474592247207183
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	6.984126275214277
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	8.326095377853992
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	6.630065070714002
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	1.5823045163176663
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	6.232051087662142
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	9.0820827310832
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	5.792976525757083
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	1.1438227504289553
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	8.137297974352947
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	9.39934569852651
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	3.968178179395395
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	8.149281558891976
By now they are far away.	7.377947033094473
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	7.395191114921552
No-one would benefit from this situation.	2.6421771827005385
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	6.447523568245574
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	8.488934805866588
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	7.842037723452095
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	9.342444003269243
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	7.906904982483593
I wish you a good evening.	6.7547894500586425
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	5.261469511634922
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	6.724124649385524
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	6.041953677726856
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	6.611394016292321
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	4.849058109757055
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	9.186318488006437
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	8.497322571534127
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	7.859562607595713
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	5.827042716516928
I was told that this was a personal response.	8.508926960476593
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	4.677595480736275
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	9.248619541764683
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	6.773684388299553
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	7.656880549930658
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	7.775072648378127
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	5.529049474710331
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	5.02508560091897
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	9.97853840305056
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	6.14044025397626
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	7.545912199202155
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	9.419300091237675
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	5.265247389295765
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	7.717107186632218
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	8.413695656908903
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.	6.408522370153019
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	6.432656519829829
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	7.1564601926652545
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr D√©sir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	7.410940211169265
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	8.9087916523574
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschi√∂ld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	8.692577302642679
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	8.447931517262637
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	7.7482917740910295
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	8.15116243492977
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	5.91813258999599
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	9.403651543761123
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	8.059706403769315
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	8.221924072318707
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	5.734933000017416
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	6.051346502186268
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	5.019102808844967
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	8.021126383083605
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	7.213025238880839
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	6.189224165303402
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	8.173376679078986
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	4.476895393175886
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	6.503099997971577
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	4.854738228655967
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	7.471872973868392
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	7.461277150466863
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	4.467914940188754
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	8.726595891385672
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	5.4114850690670675
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	10.853382441808602
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	5.8144007888377605
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	6.255590894187725
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	7.683303858330541
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	6.201609278591318
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	7.4457244020444024
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	7.311634378705242
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	5.869460201297679
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	7.545427311542748
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	9.055461616527078
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	7.64920846029727
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	6.442382310593104
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	2.4068051597671243
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	6.2954580514393585
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	8.369916594464906
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	5.099766380418157
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	6.701043619754963
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	9.562094947893586
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschi√∂ld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	6.89554139769813
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	8.944820940969096
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	5.575613066127592
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	6.936766438384972
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	6.2516326845231704
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	10.348472213580498
Are there any comments?	1.2157190518115277
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	8.587615277247151
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	8.927969408080733
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	7.072563969938435
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	7.00436658663059
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	6.483470794354107
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	7.919994658965707
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	8.827028435633723
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	7.2631878151624365
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	7.434598395792527
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	4.305808715603922
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	7.474507147797019
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	10.208112859068383
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	1.2264779583237335
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	10.309562539878893
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	6.1052614817917625
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	5.977177381797848
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	7.505173247176445
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	9.157728576572177
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	7.469073109878038
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	4.577420498513618
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	7.9954404983539895
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	8.521770665728988
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	7.979295716284374
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	6.661768655179067
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	3.417733193150223
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	8.021994489747238
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	9.382624705039396
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	5.854360524185548
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	10.097918335593613
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	6.771126307975296
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	8.854172121101579
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	6.948331753116494
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	7.788377510835838
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	5.545767254490599
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	8.103274112232878
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	6.830696369893908
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	6.53856877325304
That is not correct.	16.74247181115916
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	7.211372810021144
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	7.347074312874854
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	8.870728284194952
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	5.2902148691917565
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	6.834337364095029
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	6.089206799547878
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	6.432533618233142
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	8.776289920917067
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.644126483541
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	10.41816975219997
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	8.43802032296399
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	7.271573019208306
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	9.363704167999
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de si√®cle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	6.8997112539792305
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	6.355892529744742
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	6.546628002529989
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	8.420915607363037
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	10.525079013168641
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	8.90691833799263
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	5.202554135767342
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	5.437018553747053
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.	5.993715307517069
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	7.52552246504987
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	5.975133558549751
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	6.784738327859036
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	8.689767460660743
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	10.731330564674607
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	9.571149718857141
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	9.053140643465545
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	8.083784461793526
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	6.431690173814658
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	7.896313616693864
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	8.869091089232528
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	7.061581094864066
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	8.426030829161368
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	8.106078513900789
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	6.671587858729386
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	8.114551409154327
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	7.230733014011727
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	8.417505212974534
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	6.921466021479448
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	8.127408934796097
That is excellent news!	6.585420345857277
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	7.3619584311801365
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	7.784910903172336
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	7.446979952275996
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	7.190756561813233
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	12.665706753909781
I did not hide behind any immunity.	9.069695753595386
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	7.154610467014477
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	7.477450098480627
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	9.506281693679494
Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	5.93189491734325
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue.	3.381414627475553
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	14.861828790537153
Nothing could be further from the truth!	8.386603439059547
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	8.065445080512518
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	9.237711686399493
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	7.174314725699117
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	5.5070889895988735
Why am I stressing this point?	6.123945820435746
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	9.974733279837459
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	9.64095700009011
1997 discharge	36.56604416766516
Mrs Wallstr√∂m has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.7081670973512724
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	7.1006145426881195
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	8.688036682032912
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	6.786730933570048
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	5.40174494446448
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	7.091019877329123
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	8.338406447274446
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	7.551149684483165
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	7.227261336057016
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	8.287619801179424
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	5.894847176301222
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	5.960556442064359
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	5.778782477920685
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	6.86660987427456
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	8.232548680483813
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	7.5179101537798365
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.2318698317466295
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	8.95991209328183
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	6.01427577313826
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	7.7638114998508225
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	6.300436722772663
But the source is threatening to run dry.	5.363193070991295
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	6.681440477238187
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	8.048224473183698
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	8.719404643594547
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	7.071444121303057
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	8.500205834607701
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	4.703248565977668
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	14.523978132981192
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	7.557724337227377
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	7.954985086870298
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	5.590113649583551
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	5.6887453944867366
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	10.13884576072233
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	5.480693381543174
It must be seen to deliver.	16.19068214010289
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	8.102240339402552
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	8.483894053577194
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	6.927624617171729
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	8.722480364308518
Mrs Avil√©s-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	10.940984887073386
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	9.175988464594012
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	6.639141109702823
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chev√®nement.	6.959462533125217
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	5.08800363993596
This is a big task but it can be done.	12.195509639557518
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	7.3050094575408435
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	6.525880813583107
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	8.190645057488565
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	1.1438227504289553
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	6.712672847546895
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	7.469357863174687
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	8.074376197004531
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	7.345171323411018
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	7.279916976533906
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	7.737636421250898
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	6.1734437090424015
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	6.634056697476342
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	6.882585586295432
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	7.2704409192279185
I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27¬∫ has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	8.04719528399521
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	6.757966656345805
The first country is Indonesia.	5.136449773832492
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	6.907860729114698
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	7.907481205469131
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	7.9215120711362985
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	9.936548270740513
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lom√© Convention.	7.8964183346689305
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	7.978133918095046
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	7.74663032432036
That is a fact of life.	14.586898901661884
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	7.434502132355728
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	8.916710045276101
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	7.02500495501785
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	7.597727667884287
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	6.065886332807701
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	8.624774873401593
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	8.203637966769016
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	6.340416978677646
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	6.450602310223379
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	6.691063087243241
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	8.88235930602112
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	8.605605455384778
This is a basic element of the decision.	13.080921922773802
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	5.852823366400681
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	5.192539885354609
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	6.513680929635226
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	7.655294134617896
VOTE	14.22659668727896
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	9.649570272237726
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	8.564325374431245
That is not guaranteed.	28.56539921519697
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	7.59485659280819
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	6.500626949142231
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission' s 5 year Strategic Programme	6.703403768071133
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	8.702498389257379
I will set this out in five points.	7.571417937510936
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	8.087941442231621
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	7.117218745450434
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	2.0035771665026534
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	6.5705049937440885
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	9.660013193611935
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	10.674631633239388
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	8.634084363345037
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	9.712564666000821
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	7.141018861892132
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	6.4936978699780115
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	6.976181848700671
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	8.389375031018702
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	7.362860085942593
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	7.2999313635606455
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	4.414252027416138
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	8.034904910711443
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	8.03914001886086
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	7.488109375376881
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	8.456084696442542
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	5.640426307314785
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	7.140056414074332
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	9.123485283669272
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	9.049753356187441
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	7.846632068650121
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	6.914399401333265
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	7.293782046913145
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	5.952970080384762
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	5.664660471881232
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	2.1961347497514834
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	3.9148986236110055
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	6.466946779315374
I have taken note of your comment, Mr Speroni.	3.512287627451976
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	8.015036730187271
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	5.912730344975456
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	8.674141624218699
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	6.797506208833282
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	5.543589879388699
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	8.626044117469267
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	7.341367039666099
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	8.369856351195699
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	7.768307375016999
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	8.515431145848792
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	7.640716351686201
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	8.366689218302826
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	9.894604556621614
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	6.89852090373524
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	5.413311435588931
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	7.213120358910988
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	6.466016440631753
.	52.89722204958655
This is why I am voting against the report.	3.552699656475708
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	6.460492598952401
The Community initiative means community involvement.	10.855579604549948
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	5.378602140844233
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	2.8308740160293033
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	7.444506616289031
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	8.758653477216747
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	1.2264779583237335
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	6.762994973047409
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	6.710479599001538
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	5.999196285367823
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	6.602774287841133
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	6.1097235048718455
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	6.606112605886188
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	6.916923696220693
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	2.13113043355119
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	6.641216900462698
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	5.961083792214182
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	6.765888288351258
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	7.482669120426836
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	7.6072418477600605
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	6.872562675939219
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	6.238723084799045
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	6.826110215027128
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	9.049710288344867
This FP√ñ has now entered into a coalition with the √ñVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	5.677690509572503
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	11.197386338230935
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	6.458626252341974
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	7.218508367407845
The postal service is also the bus service.	5.890329052198952
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	9.113799962860583
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¬æ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	8.340601145749542
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	5.525936188041076
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	7.74992725548438
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	7.392777062202629
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	8.751381088117355
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	8.040605880147496
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	6.813534557499176
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	6.890412195367035
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	6.636044823165658
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	6.37295995510106
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	7.704969902901726
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	6.90563582652703
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	6.146003843657137
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	7.992842729540113
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	11.994083064368919
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	7.177774386750518
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	6.852329463338735
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	9.074912141742512
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	8.948744281580762
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FP√ñ.	5.632349721893441
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the √ñVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	8.532453734054133
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	9.423570474206489
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	6.626487278204034
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	6.228312078563845
Securing this is a major priority.	13.722888949646185
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	9.313649302242382
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	8.130825904663375
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	6.861731813986469
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	7.628035463890315
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	8.236501464464396
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	8.121731778636716
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	7.074359309062736
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	10.335766124392288
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	6.650694365741592
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	6.734483517605152
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	9.860098743699588
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	7.97825032295091
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	7.559164948169495
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	5.663715590430626
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	7.4240582336078855
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	2.180909969442754
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	7.547773069673776
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	6.892090268590917
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	8.664672080445175
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	6.6094553698929035
They are political because we are moving on.	7.532314395595596
Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	5.69828213825894
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	6.795130172516797
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	6.263146291906798
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	6.6093414832444655
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	8.532785010184487
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	9.012912774805026
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	6.011362160419785
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	9.538444627816046
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	5.94518642200836
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	9.285522344217949
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	5.913176657877853
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	7.279985171101045
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	7.165305031104505
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	7.331095840514306
We really have not progressed very far.	7.565715756547283
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	6.951305779361666
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	7.231066867079435
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	5.947758350122274
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy.	5.9432109098410875
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	8.749189755274951
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	11.060176813234378
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	6.961271065998721
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	7.290848861601649
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	14.66565746029867
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	7.124272031906604
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.97923631452936
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	7.921572744596695
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	6.664037207949925
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	15.094491198752277
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	9.19255436701126
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	6.911765477613403
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	6.233722412384912
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	8.978932216449905
Certainly not!	22.88487117976323
Brussels knows best.	3.248451461328561
This is not impossible.	61.33813392515477
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	7.127886314604345
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	4.819084642119017
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	7.193833846123137
In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	6.367968233813454
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	8.781578894909869
What is a fair society?	13.523627459712369
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0142/2000) by Messrs Mrs Hautala, Mr Lannoye and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the strategic objectives for 2000-2005	5.402816478577761
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	6.622428083585784
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	6.5299409401660675
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	5.415325791922503
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	7.0343400732439845
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	5.777261108813581
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	7.078207034765148
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	4.610232370480771
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	4.7865610897154784
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	4.05896265416741
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	7.610380931552403
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	11.621131206742445
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	8.902623365979327
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	5.1488953735402925
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	6.781656578761034
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	6.046081132963619
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	13.706086380586482
But that cannot be helped.	5.123921497494476
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	7.844681712100346
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	9.770121019203003
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	7.945810821873738
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	7.124468666609458
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	9.321600283145584
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	8.744536381411946
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	7.81219358363447
and	18.96879558303861
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	12.253017548088334
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	5.803040877841411
Nor is there coherence vis-√†-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	6.498025247884382
Will you confirm what is the case?	15.564037421183373
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	7.886806675984272
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	6.618276744394747
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	9.246533276616958
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	6.161837345861227
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	6.27240608944141
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	8.718541863105946
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	5.6551224327833705
Cultural activity creates identity.	4.33244799421127
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	5.836315464104108
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourri√®re, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	7.007601964960864
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	8.227664452905527
Clear progress must be visible.	3.6518271980798365
There is no need for me to remind you of J√∂rg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	7.423043967253276
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	9.01392471372303
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	7.683598256181211
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	7.81939069991563
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	6.0705667413239945
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	7.7844055610655225
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	6.953790434230002
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	8.744854847050249
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	7.949607231305239
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	6.229639635404066
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	5.593775960358678
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	6.155345626060777
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	3.7941823197464615
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	11.85706409185575
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	4.959695986570676
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	5.4841642317408015
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	6.373056705747801
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	7.978164048877052
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	8.231668991514475
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	5.890869190791703
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	5.2122094147407605
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	9.595902961703164
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	10.089262249834828
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	7.7605683733369935
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	9.516990462117201
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	7.589848932530663
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallstr√∂m has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	7.645961854486963
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	7.941118391737634
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	5.738296868701951
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	6.426577464188967
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	6.054836299768743
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	8.089284138922414
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	5.890677765099533
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	7.520935117792953
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	6.817049532673117
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	7.875749018713606
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	8.980811542668691
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	10.692307276656239
In reaching an agreement with J√∂rg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	6.3737959483518765
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	7.06623501602125
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	6.906769436901697
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	7.245994980681999
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	8.542181366919731
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	11.178432016205587
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	6.348607297781433
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	7.6550650444688415
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	6.262217195544646
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	7.491850230749387
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	6.698282596862934
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	8.05477217474687
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	5.6223286953811344
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	9.87812043422721
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	7.22508727627379
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	7.900746321693003
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	8.34749733258678
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	7.080868271129463
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	6.22617645053848
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	7.699233161323046
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	9.933524756869623
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	8.807689494892763
. (FR) Mr Decourri√®re' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	7.84816808280701
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	8.569448104279202
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	5.915976519670778
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	9.670443473058619
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	6.846078082709722
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	8.71936924807354
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	5.6048633458939605
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	8.772325431325195
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	7.709135625953248
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	4.9062165665784025
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	8.560411561407255
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	11.335733058232673
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	7.345792105794791
The foul monster has been reawakened!	10.852645157539504
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	7.410650006007958
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	9.475259087354647
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	10.602813655659071
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	4.362282910906434
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	7.977888969646049
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	8.358269681913791
That concludes the debate.	1.4316418906463761
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	7.479109957438298
To continue would be economic suicide.	5.113595585291241
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	7.4727224723376615
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	5.812771626920799
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	4.363991733548507
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	6.9756452007745695
It is also of great importance to citizens.	13.393459322169825
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	7.619554771063478
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	7.926726605040703
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	6.738468200935058
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	5.083624111467163
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	8.6978405588608
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	6.142579791645679
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	7.20552804072851
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	13.393834286597714
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	7.243198636882115
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	6.358392869021588
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	9.149826595311051
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourri√®re' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	6.976466097782683
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	8.173559611749473
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	7.999745161599706
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	7.2049310729001155
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	7.0451615402993335
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	6.149578730324763
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	8.837460123404298
This is the crux of the matter.	10.135586904045022
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	9.212505477390833
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	4.016791164793638
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	7.931462692422082
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies.	5.43296142402373
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	6.667654009703175
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.6344322168051042
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	9.244650131089264
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	5.347445471662299
I just wanted to correct this.	2.404556792111785
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	6.203166765475164
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	7.712273675182405
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	11.435375482758184
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	5.692201040449522
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Hal√Ønen.	7.658543999574657
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	7.519030375586174
The unease is justified.	3.6992476244598156
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	7.079086433065943
The European Union did that at the European Union¬≠China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	9.30905304427298
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	7.956704569699788
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	6.546798219209939
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	6.883000334620769
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	5.937869078721474
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	7.983208537675466
I am a European and even a federalist.	11.713943066944209
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	5.714971978297149
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	5.9520116822431
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	5.296001869461616
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	8.782229694188084
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	7.030606263611343
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	8.675148176269651
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	6.111453942945933
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	9.59223876639054
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	8.208002315048448
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	6.700429003269728
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	6.59504334947436
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	8.108329744876782
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	9.671601752676114
Surely we should be more selective.	15.103687913525683
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	7.72534589141698
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	8.229616445626988
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	8.368109451798402
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	5.245323405280599
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	6.932950425243923
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	8.196799297338956
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	7.025828950416405
Action simply has not been taken.	6.4811872366536125
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	7.355482929541872
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	6.646345008097653
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	9.442806022367684
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	8.019264774447736
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	8.459536937367147
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	6.7048546706228445
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	7.342668629036428
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	9.99948938579232
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	10.606341396479584
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	7.65070062292503
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	6.130519490998235
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	6.250403967722839
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	10.716787850349053
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	4.972973742547144
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	7.739647098949749
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	8.389033371570633
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	4.721443196406329
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	5.237862444298138
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	7.431111816366464
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	7.0399438089355
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	6.7543433560845285
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	7.443280680801691
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	6.5516509703686125
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	7.7173272612237716
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	9.318774936206166
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	6.391790555737615
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	6.8343700657065325
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	7.334353021286774
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	6.8699290209753805
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	6.9155742392645445
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	7.341881613754464
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	6.602047306016336
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	8.146237039526506
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	6.6463564966845246
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter.	5.309245936752943
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	5.649371044983622
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	6.717545847955582
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	8.923059095505907
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	8.032375649530149
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	6.9759812314295555
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	7.999800275399689
The polluter ought to pay.	6.7255322494593095
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	6.802456377250172
We all agree on this.	4.624878055025432
Why would it not work elsewhere?	7.067352573686302
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	8.800355087847725
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	7.281846194437883
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	8.332071148583477
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	8.338826593101079
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	8.115594657713851
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	6.527247065927015
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	7.25668131859365
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	9.271495629426907
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	9.04172838053939
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	6.6346545180399605
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	6.571652227288085
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	6.5409119347775455
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	7.993537939183171
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	5.587944556141074
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	4.384323678870742
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	7.877864336117107
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).	2.8530456886198605
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	8.433459360027665
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	6.328911488394713
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	6.912211508699012
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	7.947198452008821
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	6.963891324791172
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	7.7388532504875425
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	6.3301761778512535
Helicopters are therefore needed.	6.842159377106057
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	6.903250203117135
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	10.314632969100956
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	7.353781585771234
The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	8.596089461936996
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	8.854219791252406
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	6.547194273277796
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	9.286664846534922
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	7.882740750174379
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	6.739825218745083
Thank you, Mrs Wallstr√∂m.	12.492890117174287
Where does all that leave us this year?	6.474548851944787
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	5.355874172389148
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	8.243180530611662
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	8.292833684376172
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	7.631432747198447
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	5.505971753668661
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	9.465779375936767
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	7.026629170818209
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	8.067441730636189
. (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	8.24755649568943
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	12.253110827494778
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	6.484860574095935
Cederschi√∂ld report (A5-0008/2000)	1.0720115699223667
Relating to Amendment No 6	1.2284514190205091
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	9.85068083768937
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	9.383185437424876
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	8.411358825361416
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	7.918560513612591
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	6.837460071416291
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	7.354441941838715
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	4.82206420052692
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	7.272115404715544
Floods in Mozambique	76.28290393254406
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	5.877399110305628
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	6.525183326113769
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	7.332582755206536
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.076338907151673
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	7.763946190775577
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	8.026894732414494
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	6.083361842567888
Not that we do so every week.	14.077138194872402
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	8.208351069377157
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	7.309169393333673
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	7.134897368114785
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	8.814956599497304
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	5.632696736561478
Thank you for your answer.	2.6433784032636574
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	5.7764740866479265
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	8.308777642957526
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	6.08181878419149
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	7.532901605774162
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	7.20693144850228
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	7.185143764017945
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	11.033924103670769
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	8.511181733927478
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	7.059007311283756
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	8.384374081802308
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	7.472141962238169
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	7.668446798173333
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	7.593091470842327
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	7.96405915954438
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	6.53208523616489
It should not be in the amendment.	11.32975586526707
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	8.189337434998745
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	6.858865612598214
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	7.468592577362155
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	9.847772251482374
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	6.100859127399207
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	7.959458023837743
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	8.080044385798777
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	7.250484073494915
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	10.479995145958476
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	7.356662326050851
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	7.78097031915465
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post¬≠colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	8.106206238730737
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	7.684450873958872
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	8.137215819900478
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	6.809087300758372
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	5.126430102201615
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	5.216796417858663
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	7.884939197681433
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	7.580311346258161
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	6.092936592877388
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	6.110709417176092
Colleagues, you know the rules.	9.827370178748978
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	6.987882809305673
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	6.508257812818073
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	8.77500178186138
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	8.503135569808382
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	8.441120641945854
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	7.640909871938657
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	9.363187952122662
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	6.509217232400217
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	8.546501064186087
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	8.180304091564938
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	7.36169313144756
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	5.584599267958651
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	7.31026731504886
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	6.95055789495119
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	2.233131218835934
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	10.3606481030195
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	6.99312978714508
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	6.0389427271737715
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	7.214608363438088
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	5.147841278879173
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	7.204630451121817
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	9.682271016931907
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	7.573079499014837
Take the trade agreements.	6.738074199401509
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	9.248689138291214
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	5.702531945904898
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	6.794598398341428
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	7.217353653085283
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	5.603194456730864
So it is a step forward.	6.1602672213570235
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	7.626764766065363
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of R√©union, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exup√©ry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	6.445246578356524
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	7.693004812100733
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	7.770289540009203
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	10.96086525359658
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' .	6.720113229698593
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	7.746875444726705
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	7.535496630179819
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	6.999738442360971
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	7.523461614253487
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	7.146563191588135
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	8.06195497390854
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	9.36801479767094
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	9.101311006165865
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	6.908620631354044
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	6.20857366875123
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	4.485918139088755
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	7.091161754114318
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	7.010658769403451
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	5.689359976806104
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	6.602664553662087
It is a retrograde step.	21.48818849430331
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	8.610536740244775
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	4.816621183110801
Values should take precedence over power.	5.118430051452301
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	10.363557520336915
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	5.915947351606322
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	6.521098058936076
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	7.744488283909969
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	9.729898593009843
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	7.271142842691164
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	8.463132263589044
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	6.749823818470663
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	7.260936102551478
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	5.052401842954228
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	5.274615363857823
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	6.678592637298394
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	7.965896076478111
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	5.803805084089213
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	7.800438709967707
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	7.178590102304107
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	8.979384748331743
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	9.9164342846332
That is important, for at least three reasons.	8.381282049840696
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	6.6550645984079475
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	10.39137261179442
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	6.880759643645355
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	7.3676125614601595
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	7.881989059041368
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe' s social protection, health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	7.94409737301186
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	7.765374960645716
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	10.98130988966736
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	7.48139419142113
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	4.9617700465743
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	9.124633418862471
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Rom√°n, on LEADER.	4.183443987348204
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	8.495764034899095
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	7.9103929561036015
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	8.395380199235301
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	5.97314673025211
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	7.722581820992072
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	7.136073745191976
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	3.3592297805686178
However, Mr Decourri√®re does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	5.838101163085
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	7.05144579320971
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	4.312736217872342
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	5.2635276749823525
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	8.693141881745715
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	8.76882767010499
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	9.701412537684465
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	6.355539955867976
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	8.03918311201813
I will give some examples shortly.	10.327075733101701
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	3.4630891678125337
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	6.786070402888558
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	5.361820269216664
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	7.28056520872548
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	10.311414494595006
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	9.9659149611452
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	5.860300233814566
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	7.092025150162532
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	3.470608249868417
.	52.89722204958655
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	8.559493341961872
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	8.324769053946243
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	6.06765108078725
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	7.113381847558198
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	10.44085899766076
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	7.5753222273667085
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	6.320889255956269
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	8.99378089824611
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	6.676461569121052
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	8.908971297058155
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	8.149262529066199
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	8.91467136190124
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	7.171734471455571
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	4.546472073714566
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	6.497697186459753
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	6.073270142748038
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	6.727716412390962
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	2.1020652867535046
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	7.504899402264952
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	7.985977530733689
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	7.262938082604377
NATO is largely European.	5.91002469744806
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	9.11468758632483
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	17.59510288865332
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	6.381164916368251
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	6.8160993325678545
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	7.338623388832302
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	8.835686081110401
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	6.676282233611205
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	7.998276169212932
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	8.205015929325002
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	6.771263184412909
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	7.453259633346378
.	52.89722204958655
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	6.378122681317345
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	6.113989279193598
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	6.639071757675189
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	8.306183308508002
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	7.82419777139274
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	6.43833030510147
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
I say they have a right to solidarity.	8.823721226452259
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	8.03765843560587
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	7.775679135846734
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmstr√∂m.	11.340960900626849
I understand this.	3.751893891565887
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	7.997334166592974
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	6.8656041504760354
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	6.440695875503525
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	7.815486834435282
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	8.032574379153205
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	9.408320859814364
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	6.601584886584778
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	7.827969426421924
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	6.553501695462313
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	8.65420200725086
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	7.066631545342777
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	7.2968043620040905
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	9.602647228418094
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	7.498890166200539
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	4.278624945656947
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	8.546065148515769
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	6.875631082696961
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	9.655850542487553
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	8.23355116331749
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	7.122250752464832
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	7.521011001168473
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	6.131391525651722
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	7.120916672079413
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	8.418747561938694
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	13.805445066935413
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	7.1074783934429
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	11.852527204680081
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	9.533493241590586
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	6.256103505449734
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	6.874650118447064
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	6.318659950737473
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	6.322662894824334
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	6.953784701813113
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	8.687387825903746
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	7.564246739297918
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	7.070006770838679
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	7.471933798430496
Court of First Instance	1.0021355768605706
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	8.908132482944955
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	7.7566922663800035
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	6.636885263890113
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	6.4956793843524245
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	5.943003021268823
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	6.896754288223813
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	5.999203244449541
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	4.444967192445689
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	7.58513285694039
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	8.721220691807929
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	7.8831062220377355
What is your opinion on that?	9.264601323998123
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	7.13506856213294
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	8.462335849412256
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	6.928964037172956
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	7.3477416669898945
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	7.517186869912648
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	6.996044205337359
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	7.407992330447122
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	6.070741773922219
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	7.099326115554545
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	6.376582615284336
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	8.019328146240946
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	4.933253784951997
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	6.76680616950448
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	8.404362183733763
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	8.311449950910344
In the case of Turkey it is different.	8.380800958031527
II. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (9614/1999 - C5-0167/1999 - 1999/0805(CNS))	1.912644855678345
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	10.895143065976539
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FP√ñ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	8.354284352534156
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	8.475754206891454
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	6.05332402943775
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	8.647722411220245
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	7.08272145183875
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	7.61201860012072
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	8.277213271956654
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	7.416362174882885
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	6.813498753258043
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	5.657583401780663
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	9.58612139299225
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	5.442863284394519
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	5.758450255802181
I say: shame on them!	6.8979265451620035
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	12.852643977045885
That is why we need transparency.	8.918561634532503
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	7.015791900425284
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	7.1373826733224215
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	9.098069345775134
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	8.64968570092987
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	8.558980865862525
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	7.050728929574223
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	9.094823070786981
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	6.577401643448067
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	6.798919293040173
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	7.896589256022977
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	9.461260193522447
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	6.077180060956873
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	6.5586032936939
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	6.85894540950033
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	8.601886588602962
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	8.398435944250807
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	7.2446806705979485
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	6.52164480599016
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	5.623264364980335
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	7.443495882649977
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	8.223892860927208
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	8.401847391448053
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	7.099887493731514
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	7.595537006525667
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	9.056785685870048
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	9.101578593803982
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	1.7953177119572696
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	8.320017641620915
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	7.738770675450355
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	7.031563739721778
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	8.23270464179286
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	5.730140577535839
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	7.34443310264068
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	7.8983499596338405
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	9.162967469095186
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	5.292082312197877
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	6.774603574733659
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	7.612522599520486
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	7.669757504905603
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	7.320439001366217
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	7.713637913912572
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	10.1795239115883
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	6.9839234222916975
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	9.293008615456763
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	6.926229623513244
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	4.918640582828371
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' .	7.825597140662188
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	7.686274685874366
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	8.325627253871781
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	10.977526633046162
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	7.870654455014937
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	8.595890935193582
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	4.561642051154521
Parliament has frequently made that point.	3.973724396540021
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	8.739578882577197
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	3.4833912918701224
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	7.0240730537724625
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	8.271930954543048
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	8.451759531316677
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	7.9437775490478835
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	7.897191092471008
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	7.986607957764462
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	8.967516916618564
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	10.224714583645998
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	8.402889999285215
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	7.477525148711619
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	5.878979405215503
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	3.884884551256932
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	8.260096207967957
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	6.394743641905961
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	8.169924046500862
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	6.710628149974055
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	7.087063490344846
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	7.965625603700516
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	7.7739450148672296
After five years only four have done so.	5.573584801478685
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	8.727665879755751
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	8.94778978153675
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	6.701846686086524
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	6.7164841337939425
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	7.531403777033933
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	5.864315492266214
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	8.466319446159579
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	5.954320535824114
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	7.914286081589639
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	6.981257421836558
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	6.354965973880132
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	8.826975823344503
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	7.7021558730590645
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	6.210940348224703
When will you make it compulsory?	8.298171296070286
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	7.712083748834967
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	7.642167443016502
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	10.368980770041926
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	7.687440603215455
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	8.131367560805586
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	6.483946913582765
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	7.386445160134447
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	7.574777912817924
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	7.632248906265853
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	6.974667746440522
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	9.064559070915237
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	9.497527647817225
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	9.20430563946704
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	5.5909508815313735
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	8.479441189536807
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	7.392222002575656
Let the managers manage.	3.9518917769628135
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	8.21433509240154
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	8.557778719837932
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	6.618816566192281
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	5.072322108825298
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	6.861152590618458
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	7.4903174905566745
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	10.19411286547038
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	8.20015428556806
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	9.463492449776739
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	8.514758074232821
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	6.903444904701346
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	6.987923554570607
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un proc√®s d'intention.	7.7060590922680765
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	6.597426634344175
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	6.824014208092641
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	5.526977519018842
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	7.00440520449755
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	6.580724060698945
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	6.172527601719841
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	9.637550031517595
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	6.4996276384470235
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	8.138875160729961
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	6.218005663767038
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	8.978360557861818
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	8.16051404241338
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	7.298065121460898
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	11.763265853687926
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	9.409989727049968
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	7.086566072038742
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	8.503128882280281
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	7.353567888723746
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	8.391700047714739
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	8.91716951933375
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	9.785572416167627
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	7.22423595684046
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	8.644269563040114
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	9.755316546264053
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	10.465592034981114
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	2.981630752597706
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	9.694560020848478
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	8.602917242480723
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	6.352531101073379
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	6.568287264366505
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	8.353772944090684
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	6.856849265765333
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	8.15335237744257
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	9.348719203391507
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	7.103009802690178
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	5.826511006843966
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	7.368939776514324
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	5.993182292300275
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	3.6344443078201176
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	6.657188750528565
It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	6.896502065084959
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	8.65599418047008
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	8.170218273934422
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	5.090091653184931
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	9.215342229261621
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	7.666243537071535
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	4.836855467410916
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	7.36021404835873
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	8.109539775547715
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	5.565034087634102
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	7.866352688138566
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	6.101470999511196
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	6.896323742039243
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	7.551518661120812
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	6.430881694368984
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	8.045312064241463
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	9.008292610952669
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	12.603902284979347
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	10.545535790577057
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	6.470536517023749
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	7.088675475066454
Most companies hate competition.	6.690657985420209
The common position stipulates 2006.	11.434902916460993
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	5.104542418578598
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	6.464569195045544
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	7.242029255537696
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	5.7837547458058705
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	5.662805851551685
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	7.980752017113551
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	8.86481528720819
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	6.2609351381834
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	8.989030015847367
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	8.884416458682061
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	9.847741171462273
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	7.218956487590941
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	7.985319786538829
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	8.67360127846431
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	6.013099435919934
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	7.098933891031104
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	8.774044768842005
Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	7.591864075947483
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	8.814429502667037
Coherence of EU policies with development	1.3424241916288246
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	6.3587803422245255
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	6.716871070700996
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	10.523500712833036
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	9.190734893597451
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	7.419845685709583
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	6.849047215054316
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	5.300976455686474
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	6.3159626905824044
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	8.617936521039821
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	7.665636091041581
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	7.313326659843479
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	6.319094523206035
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr D√©sir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	7.418033164935678
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	6.354585780076756
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	8.785975588506664
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	7.5693813518369915
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	6.96062969606071
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	6.938652026037628
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	8.856360155165069
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	8.52267168297913
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	8.09803017655813
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	7.1657656163379695
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	6.825896099854135
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	9.10795821749397
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	6.080237780700943
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	9.934509250198406
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	5.724339815371394
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	7.519554903182348
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	9.631672957399822
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	7.841667967080925
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	7.765612245372681
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	6.839676704560533
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	6.349792167934059
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	2.5096930895617757
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	5.288287362711565
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	6.911620977495752
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	5.8655340764622075
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	7.304808471483648
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	5.0964882281997745
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	7.58488325354473
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	7.6851253925886445
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	7.91154299171234
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	7.587666502814596
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	6.3060172884103896
They would then determine their own prices.	6.334296840116423
We all know the picture.	19.219915954654105
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	9.417112500937034
We insist on this.	6.436182528806358
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	6.408785277864926
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	10.892306449050718
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40¬∫C.	9.400040769599721
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	9.889418345989537
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	7.28006073601632
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	7.921543362455026
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	6.235686776168627
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	7.652788206058147
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	7.103712687036003
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	6.978593050014898
Many thanks for this.	6.581237063568549
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	7.893479706809614
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	7.723745341240317
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	14.042876817874463
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	8.687979535001748
I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	7.783860487966536
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	6.450876510212914
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	8.174865589016774
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	7.263212752608041
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	8.215724151371447
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	8.085853686920503
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	6.762862386317383
The form the aid takes is important.	6.429176534029533
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)).	3.215937248505105
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	4.3933815066081845
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	6.368345880478548
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	6.916121188112839
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	7.259010419863682
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	6.887314503600201
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	7.547693311558779
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	7.921311311611945
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	4.686310297316459
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	6.302710939621163
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	6.925143960913918
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts.	6.835528680901195
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	9.315970959452557
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	8.180663359548946
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	4.441760132413296
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	5.953224199270545
That was how it was.	6.590818736306016
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	16.128547370466585
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	6.673372111932385
This is no longer tolerable.	2.509956025000664
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	10.33922234101099
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	6.008936989516645
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	7.419573938035847
We cannot afford to waste time.	6.2859427977758875
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	6.618647914038025
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	6.381773277679956
Press freedom in Angola	7.630409051756969
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	8.954244360839974
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	6.970942656687074
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	8.568260710067928
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	8.868213003420422
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	8.250605326075386
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	8.627620167310997
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	7.746330979881596
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	7.112199265655393
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	6.607813265087269
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	7.547379167714602
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	7.497341788981144
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	8.043717185094376
It has been a useful debate.	13.381388748966454
So further thought is necessary.	4.837068077377054
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	5.461734524897319
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	9.523967485669427
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	8.130154965621124
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	7.423499065105689
They want answers.	3.024528385268799
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	6.195563069361133
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	8.703902681137121
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	7.941963492103727
I look forward to the next round.	10.20399751490234
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	9.2224317247501
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	7.615065338324068
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	8.424833288897375
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.	5.5570253592718535
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	8.942761443203347
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	8.445292387654536
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	6.276633078160859
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	8.41428174032087
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	8.41256796351547
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	8.296462387732221
The first key concern is independence.	5.096508624212325
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	6.799920583267029
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	8.198886764083348
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	7.17318671186
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	8.550297577092188
Just a few main points.	12.789464438617143
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	6.646196866986661
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	7.25201784023495
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	6.9061152140910975
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.076338907151673
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	7.136349027390562
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebasti√°n, Gregorio Ord√≥√±ez.	5.351147712263911
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sj√∂stedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	7.385505983101347
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	7.102751310325815
So what was done at Amsterdam?	7.815500379532193
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	6.706320197257743
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	5.981976850528151
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	6.356366270725645
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	6.9168299164267
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	9.504082545453878
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	7.8170802079103465
The honourable Member raised the question.	13.968767528680146
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	7.010449090513222
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	5.892165200406222
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	11.186902018179905
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	6.043461515991991
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	7.181560464478199
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	4.88670357478462
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	9.013500852183368
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	6.6006952129253245
That, too, is a step forward.	7.852385049486449
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	8.295496428282991
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	9.29820505200707
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	7.592172485758948
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.662086236476205
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.041498219455892
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	11.008996696619894
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	8.261896682367519
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	6.399692358757486
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	7.409042566380744
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	6.335645644852873
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	9.104402369585907
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	7.6906487237414325
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	8.338788046067156
Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS))	2.528188812279129
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	6.792373596283396
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	8.270699434402495
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	8.622468082226343
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	7.066280561533034
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	7.657130367860729
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	9.251314433728371
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	10.17499487277719
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	6.937829065454867
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	7.750239245860562
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	10.775713979428147
The European Union made a specific d√©marche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	9.746740516763786
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	11.44072061698481
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	7.8913623438999085
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	8.311344559841626
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	4.567081118836124
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	8.983712716517875
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	8.607599377313168
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	9.30047428607526
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	6.483944774031628
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	7.100475804006506
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	6.360031283715434
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	7.049716067424866
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	6.859359596465034
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	9.966796246546776
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	6.743196694132529
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	7.918220006498921
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	7.911741272647275
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	7.673593285719179
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	7.800898785428191
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	6.683000864634036
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	8.899860639157906
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	6.285404002866661
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	7.5737279520181895
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	6.038297289272553
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	6.483423261599822
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	6.733207367129344
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	9.103500399829443
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	7.011021431820233
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	8.25859243031838
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	8.487579942895595
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	6.595529875546807
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	6.114718198829644
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	7.36614854115264
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	3.2634794004411676
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	10.023178094708868
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	8.899580309623135
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	8.494930302758931
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	6.712841691958478
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	6.911454639488322
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	6.444336781110343
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	9.371027941708737
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	7.686093210901866
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	8.07863760149718
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	11.601190861343861
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	6.10381482210411
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	8.119774978034238
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	7.7772934723308085
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	8.589402070856634
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	14.457622784922552
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abh√§ngigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gew√§hrt werden m√ºssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	7.3225830705252895
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	6.176385069597385
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	8.107121505138723
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	8.852700949713176
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	6.970550062489179
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3165503112335124
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	6.671568227499842
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	6.843132200198823
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	7.870178257169654
The √ñVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	7.276313999430487
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	7.786945481586241
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	5.97704974305417
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	9.171962237406882
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	4.93535828163996
The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	9.160236592681496
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	8.290646888454852
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	8.597143053210516
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	9.319070010285513
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	7.332838170910316
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	6.598333832449607
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	8.09193083724979
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	9.644597750063934
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	4.969168276188865
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	7.9258139198239155
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	7.696377894056166
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	7.875795825128151
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	5.6483877080234075
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	7.064921757979148
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	2.4129532694978737
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	9.59888047815062
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	5.522983400513377
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	8.198037268269907
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	7.403675351025453
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	5.987770978363799
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	10.220702267657373
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	7.089541745913422
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	7.025471768368768
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	7.465131209624118
As a last resort, we would ask the √ñVP to look into alternatives.	6.853464815508839
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	5.454832136896043
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	8.26666766281934
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	9.762488996288019
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	10.833000057462701
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	7.1440552609023475
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	9.26111067317309
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	6.130280259289896
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	9.289369887258731
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	9.821731088029729
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	7.3051706518561375
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	9.049982311329535
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	6.604281178744917
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	4.577003859523139
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	6.143669590365864
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	5.683918521030945
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	9.688203412122443
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	14.962560274217482
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	6.084184898029278
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	4.308090327927711
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	5.877310592675737
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	7.661786733449231
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	10.883973782681643
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	6.988037133976627
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	9.525581769136704
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	7.487262904732278
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	7.231173663851132
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	5.935098569081564
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	9.51000861043776
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	7.168751987843079
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	9.699470628661203
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	8.9093274722963
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	6.277541174910067
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	7.173826662187606
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	6.681499313775313
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	7.914885111408536
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
The postal service is also the social service.	4.95964777711577
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	5.945802903047224
The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	8.54328461691525
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	1.4905937735470531
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	6.937528376715657
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	8.148197404164812
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	7.744717784082679
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	9.595095035569557
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	8.263698642931908
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	6.729378535618485
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	7.641843031042079
And there are more and more of us in the world.	7.725846975123085
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	5.8848557825745305
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	8.160162531688458
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	4.784441298051813
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	12.707474843894158
This has since been unanimously approved.	5.65896400271569
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	6.73640718721499
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	8.10341362689057
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	8.251053386960121
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	7.042648937857007
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	9.351851366389049
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	4.124334005175663
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	7.706367694820205
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	6.310260668976268
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	4.100655396662586
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	13.023524077383758
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	5.794829953507808
During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague V√©ronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	6.302656604524544
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	8.277306094139453
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	5.641748985547728
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	7.702844635548903
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	9.081951404646993
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	7.962357726793046
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	7.83634961709335
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	5.180791311148643
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	11.863530301748192
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	7.7376471999805965
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	8.919156706725083
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	7.952716299316535
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	7.375439597700799
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	9.766029485051693
I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	7.299325142184568
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	9.995754197677861
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	8.372063589054413
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	6.843454842389036
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	7.986237337998809
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	4.2152881155261825
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	8.356388776237136
However, the main concern remains ...	15.393992310837577
Where is the beef?	2.3047188835436927
There is now a new Commission.	6.729818587792851
I certainly appreciate that.	7.032628414386385
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	10.41374495455866
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.	6.490760479402664
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	9.161881150136848
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	6.508851647600528
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	7.622596735099379
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	7.4787339856542205
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	7.395321909124647
Neither is correct.	4.6673979235937
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	8.087593660781966
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	8.193218813896916
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	7.356920797900917
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	8.560493283281302
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le b√©b√© avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	7.551721633882941
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	8.897520264085205
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	8.085760197362905
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	6.795454965242822
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	6.775783610612557
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	10.945697208757592
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	4.783924250087813
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	8.624309302668848
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	7.221665445299647
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	7.278538864214482
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	8.132955943852467
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	8.700446020325076
Thank you for your reply.	2.2378188009001114
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	7.300094597744331
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	8.10968282225487
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	4.6295068151190595
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	10.864065349932051
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	2.314521316781661
That is where we really get into difficulty.	7.510130848267829
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	6.2869511769230995
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	13.977616568704848
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	5.462566902560529
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	7.345833371121028
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	8.233802508780034
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	5.5428641332037865
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	8.273825440006702
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	6.606612285771688
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	6.3534138461495
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	6.596756183665914
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	7.7948988845966225
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	5.890207126596859
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	7.786052672961603
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	7.927341475894753
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	7.335428711444962
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	8.424844972488176
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	7.2913829485798605
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	7.338515894343948
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	10.979472629082272
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	8.177904284555725
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	6.68829935193279
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	5.3499067310359045
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	7.369062676777017
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	6.475165205240349
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	7.807642556256676
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	7.515304099670817
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	6.411310061455681
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	7.034415224754503
The bet before us is a bet with time.	6.264177037426981
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	7.29386609497139
It is extremely important.	2.0344423781831726
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	8.333727628296664
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	6.681954028352606
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	7.927899486831074
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	7.577550535594726
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	7.120845615857263
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	12.008472755361346
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	8.950043066775072
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	8.936426288768653
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	7.873854459907661
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	7.3375819426703375
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	6.958771076883927
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	8.012908332834305
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	8.801020114160641
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	6.325248441342133
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	7.529112070174402
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	3.8359820706920815
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence.	6.98384163636342
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	6.127542096984127
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	8.288737447408069
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	6.678953708766474
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	6.371471744602482
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	6.4270378652606395
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	8.309786532189152
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	4.76517529579793
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	8.119184029517566
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	6.534916572612624
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	6.342884456587636
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	6.42648186762813
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	6.013666249982963
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	7.675719309984524
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	9.342301593951925
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	8.181692380752839
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	6.953553628676656
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	6.707939730612192
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	11.590690298730994
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	7.118431159580464
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	7.4858593320993005
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	9.363743543404123
It has no right to do so.	4.34699024849683
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	6.869945723702883
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	8.088103705371084
Not to save jobs.	6.370259946593541
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	3.933501344968185
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	8.65448377583513
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	7.6833627729224405
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	5.519414985685016
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	5.222256261538926
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	8.669182962604156
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	7.69296593862142
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	2.159972537599984
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	6.281955959536331
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	6.649285516872711
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	6.691339329119503
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	7.085811643225196
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	7.839693752522344
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	6.126719300837871
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	6.180077354674958
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	5.541264107049593
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	8.95041861514351
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	9.021608150316347
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	6.280774978672233
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	10.383332944491762
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	7.796894465417601
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	9.435420100972182
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	8.260287158204985
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	7.668456437273898
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	6.01991488101086
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	8.518267007383484
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	7.332843852605502
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	9.3947720110253
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	8.579872631686769
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	7.448086686364732
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	11.81895195669938
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	14.264327178572026
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	8.418858362987912
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	6.578014606047193
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	5.89585533562233
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	10.416645467061933
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	5.453760751960409
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	9.648255437434672
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	8.800236309373119
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	7.76113881696054
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	5.490255523432268
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	8.939053290357652
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	6.629388762843994
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	7.203445482346265
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschi√∂ld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	8.97917813927376
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	8.496326835723268
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	7.628025701727912
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	1.1438227504289553
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	8.728395324680854
However, we must stick to the facts.	12.358386662741824
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	7.123047718773519
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	6.606772673888764
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	11.241377433641732
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	6.732756815025954
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	7.5004015441412175
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	6.71162042125961
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	7.298862783577496
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	10.425730116079274
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	5.663633369901077
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	9.291341052299643
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	6.773853537937334
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	7.68735499400079
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	7.506480079335756
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	7.96726838470451
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	15.464330108948465
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	11.89424661845107
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	8.457431440056054
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	7.174260505532431
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	8.417658070036149
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	8.69667174184193
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	7.054018712679964
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	8.678278919670833
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	7.903179756209068
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	6.959012809413688
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	7.819226282265955
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	8.010796932757517
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	8.66690262944262
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	7.013224167922278
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	6.2500385343016305
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	8.120305020699329
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	8.486623004014403
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	5.689256951025053
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	8.073171517756876
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	7.589040046096258
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	5.67135147654408
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	5.826423465441812
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	5.606648220835824
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	9.877746725737378
We can deal with it.	4.533540255460352
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	8.396750348023485
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	5.11072315358575
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	6.569687060850401
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	9.455279101143883
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	7.757529270835683
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	6.702586688658077
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	5.805567276933595
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	6.2573066704363995
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	5.664805013589859
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	49.769214360378506
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	7.674281998637665
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	7.229145433087041
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	8.917637580085442
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	6.681023963415423
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	5.836126920049599
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	8.296797069461897
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	5.67997307961985
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	7.603055948537609
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	4.698504525999333
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	6.8431335437536385
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	6.302871643522222
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	9.431257193122834
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	8.677456854678512
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	3.865482673289653
That is absolutely crucial.	9.013637123140729
We consider the English version to be the original text.	9.805877291565174
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	7.532943882839847
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	7.558249482658041
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	7.188182680615954
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	7.06618964247339
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	6.727340715349277
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	8.962695422589347
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	8.800196755654941
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	9.371946162561374
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	6.982504675225887
Mr Cox, Mr H√§nsch, would this be acceptable to you?	6.1706402620892575
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	7.192946805596691
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	10.101130169260825
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	7.465803731693452
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	8.96664347814568
And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	5.116716803500783
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	6.609247102046594
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	7.660929381861684
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	6.634317563087306
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	8.487863570791635
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	7.783666750164147
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	7.596360296294587
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	8.827041253059724
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	5.326263661613004
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	6.234357278031503
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallstr√∂m to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	7.798159812769292
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	6.411596917616945
There, the border question is obviously central.	7.120390131990097
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	7.874475673689817
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	8.715782042230153
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	6.637444847686677
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	7.656664341688285
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	7.263631435254681
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3507955926649446
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	7.909763673775497
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	7.644196374980379
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	4.726686736523821
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	7.266810497971308
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	12.805680881853599
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	8.984946519793722
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	13.846316810276635
Intergovernmental Conference	46.285069293388226
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	7.786959204190264
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	6.230165198834451
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	7.405349446492263
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	8.19044711736775
We think they should.	6.44750262092454
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	5.944250016465586
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	5.527666455505078
(Loud applause)	1.0785651321630196
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	6.014627935734877
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	6.0474477740287735
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	9.189659717180023
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	7.596574025443308
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	6.104092597054099
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	8.351772175971744
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	8.249004810858624
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	5.617190262157987
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	6.1980157707885235
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	6.994307570363278
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	6.4744517769925025
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	6.362758482081465
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	5.521101510087773
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	5.577067917759417
Consistency and action are needed.	6.801177866160108
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	6.72466950429197
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	5.7945842141964885
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	8.207406679344
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	5.004738910081106
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	6.368147619098068
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	10.282405489265848
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	8.18862689050316
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	5.931641781243529
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	7.308857481533928
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	7.7194476433426935
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	6.6154802650523195
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	10.832543220774928
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	6.031482221218709
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	9.888888211881163
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	7.704948831910399
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	7.689434560017055
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	6.887691702991044
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	6.9031773727479475
There were women everywhere.	4.161733543470678
One example is water transfers.	5.2269584712695
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Sch√ºssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	8.44372867151643
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	8.779712335850236
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	8.989422533099976
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	7.0870469939443845
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	6.328716839288555
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	7.684890077337332
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	9.647563979148622
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	10.229875918852105
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	11.784285920837398
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	7.860782647032072
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	9.216254255564293
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	7.110058653182406
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	9.532795559473561
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	6.43168412164578
These are what are missing.	6.910983404362023
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	10.155220178292119
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	4.9329692662093425
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	3.0076034752098417
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	7.144195034505932
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	10.927376495568295
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	9.269007594838444
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	6.505174520414433
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	5.18829721837219
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	7.088750610231549
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	9.310971592085185
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	6.5931467960403545
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	7.565739545830735
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	7.329783966011308
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	7.10707824968685
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	8.28093375616139
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	9.14356830070184
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	9.74332088134811
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	9.723543525851024
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	6.759372551544844
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	8.464006400555414
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	6.723011824245294
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	6.589560213957092
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	8.222492283790118
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.	9.20105982722241
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	8.238296412098432
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	7.364873401800356
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	8.678858819328186
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	4.575413817259337
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	6.991904816410311
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	6.847407150801403
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	7.008369916237089
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Sch√ºssel.	6.434355583354789
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	7.884181788780281
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.3888185805878668
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	9.86272338375426
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	8.823728800856466
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	7.796650390464878
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	7.453451502674656
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	9.249063629252019
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	8.015873867970145
First OSPAR.	84.09922128608918
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	9.772502596854151
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	6.62830376503812
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	9.291010327415734
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	7.628404671214818
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	7.712652005156073
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	7.019080818699907
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	8.782092420612804
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	9.263376481417556
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	9.801661491989181
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	8.66761977163921
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	8.152425853552122
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	8.035135228174655
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	6.022771039707869
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	9.013441429316632
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	6.245682649059471
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	5.461937800588046
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	5.8265827039019396
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	7.887954383125765
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	8.1355249605413
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	6.910427233599052
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	7.102513746106469
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	9.918315606335536
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	6.9790097905134125
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	5.530053901777257
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	7.096374353871372
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	6.823004784178932
We need stronger banking supervision.	4.54572945560826
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	6.792332428776871
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	8.150331524632639
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	6.75834020487459
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	8.760993481267533
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	7.584890902609374
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	6.850399783951231
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	6.234716229983286
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	6.9096774507503
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	7.701266001258756
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	11.816968596292833
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	11.849613800906472
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	10.73251278171122
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	8.262285615266093
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	5.825672572611088
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	7.025438395762481
I cannot accept that.	4.750759064729431
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	8.956300831184684
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	6.486527015253706
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	7.294807608561866
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	5.871836502222506
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	7.580812557599099
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	7.414629275491299
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	8.353084735623678
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	8.211821546148942
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	6.51216370170519
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	8.69455946729864
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	9.066282406552336
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	7.714545122693383
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	8.371116311587942
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	10.20747619296436
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	7.512637555009998
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	6.517161258215803
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	5.8785616045836
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	10.800000209192126
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	7.340395673521506
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	13.646131635121774
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	7.13226670058481
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	9.627298125370087
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	6.274077031366429
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	7.549414026760799
VOTE	14.22659668727896
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	8.332554166013018
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	7.838206716926567
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	7.281054103302435
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	6.47569217358018
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	7.70940414865235
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	7.451945259097294
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	5.892762907689527
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Kn√∂rr Borr√†s.	6.76091480548159
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	7.523204398966035
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.876121441851807
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	8.127271203248522
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	7.177286297432333
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	8.169473062344489
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	6.581850761893855
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	8.666754603334825
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	10.14978230381052
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	6.955777629268856
The Lom√© Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	7.6663217595322894
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	7.212628735319121
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	6.729600205782365
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	5.173560797013225
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	8.506690995370867
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	7.303860352210163
Next, we have flags of convenience.	10.420221732238177
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	8.341439306259682
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	8.175134074056794
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	7.520927517440643
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	6.293284590861578
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	6.681561176127011
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	5.945280862224465
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	10.469501257601504
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	6.619686804925254
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	8.443109328470847
ALTENER	14.22659668727896
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	10.017546301150139
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	5.922449053582385
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	7.90916701356707
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	8.894418524646625
Community policy in the field of water	2.514926110956322
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	8.843190310333314
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	4.283666894397899
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	5.53758782016932
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	8.011669393452078
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	4.935033887596299
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	8.817884950616223
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	7.207692417568858
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	6.122652500649321
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	6.0058668823759955
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	8.152697158333837
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	4.2779334422806965
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the √ñVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The √ñVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	7.823476292165289
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	6.215661300174184
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	7.128564269472607
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	7.096957874689865
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	7.502874620637151
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	6.544620459989433
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	5.6012886478780635
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	9.069766556214313
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	7.963171522798835
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	7.825211653072157
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	8.975431019931026
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	7.198906949008566
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	6.030863413448552
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	8.292068032667094
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	6.768515530447461
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	8.03320550021419
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	7.94016456516396
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	7.120967817909599
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	7.342706105138555
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	7.242176871868941
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	7.160430871506202
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grosset√™te and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	5.261267228537984
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	7.242173390901705
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	6.201961314739677
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	8.124109989484882
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	7.903130407593498
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	8.261000560331897
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	8.505719754129085
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	9.620237148076729
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	7.373343858406378
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	6.0592232375324
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	7.150807513622789
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	10.272530143934645
I think that he is correct in this regard.	9.309917070631942
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	9.168739394260811
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	10.095859317433387
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	7.090047042679216
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	5.970495679890246
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	7.142682506623598
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	9.391733609031435
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	7.77646867375444
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	7.444903703897181
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	9.269872130457275
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	9.426363478234215
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	5.452010453468161
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	11.014807648722783
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	8.007465542236906
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	9.607583446130725
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	7.236895340041296
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	7.200947761449069
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	8.171260089032451
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	6.778783872157492
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	8.994819692840295
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	13.06391648944195
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	5.117020257534683
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	6.615163244275808
In theory, we could have done so.	5.049502925956363
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	7.3219788929479375
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	6.986159530914654
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	3.3813791588046724
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	8.162893120923421
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	7.205127952563692
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	5.5573189655560755
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	6.397555519038059
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	7.81399064587759
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	8.972541068474037
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	9.24773866496713
We must take the best from each of our countries.	10.391795922559576
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	7.27782759973049
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	7.218332077423495
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	6.677212245628143
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	7.030994077948824
In our opinion, the Union' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	7.379297898176628
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	6.351237250394405
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	7.868397131413256
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	8.363176357481736
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	6.399517131738195
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	4.942097823093103
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	8.287895226656827
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	4.56572661480154
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	10.342222160789785
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	6.882384891697012
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	7.780776602347435
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	5.7962072237018605
What about women?	6.5190468039052485
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	8.382582501137886
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	7.939573571364998
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	7.9361539994739845
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	8.571712493739774
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	7.427077068923516
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	6.875029483606337
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	9.72504086372808
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	9.04936745819425
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	8.081313564985546
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	9.445461204988511
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	3.6977451757797577
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	6.859532988862927
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	13.099798651250998
Thank you very much.	5.220335930877271
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	11.14507476270677
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	6.633605399452314
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	8.020583165813324
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	8.481959691718027
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	5.9532617819147795
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	8.09665306223708
Storms in Europe	309.5065510474586
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	9.505673563868042
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	7.454298863767677
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	10.719547811243485
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	8.110803632216774
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.	6.755659363315886
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	7.500668179589159
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	8.345509336683563
So how far have we come?	7.957876818694613
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	10.14417944172894
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	6.216614665289997
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	6.2956342437123425
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	6.94213249912969
Will the Commission remain silent?	15.658874308982622
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	8.814102192873092
By pitching the percentage level at 5%, which is now likely to be the case, it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage.	8.637907821335258
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	7.024895531008298
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	7.953203847795561
Underground networks?	23.404981888394214
It is not just a question of style.	5.92064890669833
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	6.505273802887
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	6.576289994641255
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	8.579973110697457
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	6.642975103739866
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	6.562781617058046
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	7.221973952917149
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	5.8390677501022115
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	7.204615401388397
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	8.126396782464562
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	8.502269632289464
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	5.380971095566334
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	6.951804299068711
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	7.179702573852305
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	7.936246663403523
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	9.258858537074703
In a sense this is where its work begins.	9.083215912658009
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	5.4866027820538905
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	3.7909203788238974
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	5.367699368197769
These are the modern means to be used.	15.533275246780917
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	7.558202670863703
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	8.572910124339638
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	7.178453575746388
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	7.141953412702408
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	5.507655428610878
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	8.891618470751856
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	6.8083577241956466
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	7.7331773470106935
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	6.286586355551802
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	8.026545692942534
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	10.427811580165514
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	7.672286244182254
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	3.993177803558182
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	7.706445681995685
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	7.6178716337431815
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lom√© Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	6.436233843705671
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3165503112335124
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	6.395060336483763
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	5.77475207710131
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	7.244472802260036
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	6.909342541247831
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	9.151833322522979
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	7.892635303662001
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	6.357323458375723
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	6.730558387920687
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	5.703328801800514
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget.	9.349187835791904
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	7.403271020273572
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	7.13793218538847
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	6.597020577874826
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	6.396938805020033
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	7.407990440867433
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	8.673562697444087
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue.	6.593010002277459
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	8.079927344397635
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	7.8567530507450805
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	10.985283415407029
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	6.572245474759191
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	2.7099067360564426
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	5.3584591742725545
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	5.942445393249771
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	10.665002211396512
And what exactly should be done?	10.17760683422083
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	7.800177729950783
Are you prepared to act upon it?	6.4230105547351295
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	6.91218003166457
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	1.7953177119572696
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	5.875387309959806
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	6.813510239689606
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	6.753164933270401
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	11.008098172574826
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	7.167783105531682
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	10.17029036997709
The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	7.4445983094518
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	6.106432228946604
We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report.	7.586841338656511
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	8.220816741593344
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	9.67416806597856
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	8.317887058216968
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	6.012791256450146
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	9.972621253238584
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	7.772979032938923
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	8.598486235893958
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	4.906969530475006
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	7.445428666978061
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	7.520211741850394
We are to know when they meet.	9.892265932083271
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr Garc√≠a-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	7.71138668839015
First of all, the policy comes too late.	7.262048925384661
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	7.257406091656524
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	8.704457066408025
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	6.275855772493116
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	8.954216975210088
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	5.953783645508199
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	6.017736341897873
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.	5.015392672375218
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	8.487184614624287
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	7.57919332580197
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	6.5885067370721195
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	6.274629112173611
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	7.00479530255176
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	6.36875840637305
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	8.394860537217065
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	5.93658186860957
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	6.830772385315318
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	9.364792614694087
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	12.214662015083652
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	4.587414298276623
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	6.8863858859569715
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-√†-vis the discharge authority.	6.73797929562731
Mr R√ºbig has the floor.	7.9410109797984845
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	8.295551845886887
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	7.559287512710127
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	9.028115060201007
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	7.448516900411565
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	6.928733210714218
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	8.48853364851789
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	11.457580317482941
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	7.233075447562441
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	7.54488203615563
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	8.742952711883046
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	11.031368473779088
So much for the quality.	14.613715415219273
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	4.632861848344238
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	6.2948787261665515
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	7.665254747667433
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	8.262070858129336
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	7.654975912313268
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	6.735658897648179
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	7.807074250410836
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	12.235118158508955
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	4.347484656931592
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	7.850905644257226
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	11.66989658433007
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	6.175117637694492
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	5.767296811966437
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	6.86649498815351
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	8.031577418845965
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	10.337827578479605
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	9.183630718109557
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	3.8948641003943125
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	6.08718954269612
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	7.663371559183275
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	5.518111551082646
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	6.246443724123641
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	8.865773119167356
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	10.078936596712161
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	7.952789973188227
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	4.9917672200401615
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	6.917929551702526
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	7.711565456418389
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	2.7935838241500983
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	10.1014852493976
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	6.4030406152170185
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	5.288123852208702
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	5.161938153683723
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	9.229732408566159
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	6.886442243818
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	5.265765103729573
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	7.051245645324516
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	5.209132946643951
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	6.215945022295835
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	8.511321870080662
Thank you, Minister.	52.21516351480012
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	7.879473414086469
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	6.730544137351903
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	12.527646381415463
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	5.674094034626727
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	6.933862332369164
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	9.513218224267353
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	10.482128386538122
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	6.499473340448679
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a T√úV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	6.279942696622469
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	5.848499130541895
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	9.12404923290914
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	8.739549857338897
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	8.091033761083605
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	8.521548221085455
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Gra√ßa Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	8.400093099410691
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	6.8886641365442305
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	7.467043774795567
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	8.419680424627964
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	7.476551019069371
This is no longer tolerable.	2.509956025000664
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	2.0769451943213655
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	7.890548582108485
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	7.632154893989395
We in the European Union are one Community.	9.608687234714598
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	7.149435905884173
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	8.929029989725533
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	9.00556890861646
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	8.119012843164858
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	7.732491880179023
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.7508188323455256
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	7.581800264665545
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	8.982156141352096
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	6.393067940859656
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	4.8568651569667685
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	8.266793624573932
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	6.276551965252758
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	7.5098727819630495
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	7.888692665728904
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	8.218022495663732
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	7.847135324534219
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	6.861721323149621
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	8.04627291362452
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	7.910160096726895
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	6.3924417619304785
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	8.458512328793931
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	5.600274048850208
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	4.8931817380450084
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	6.076460596480382
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	8.605594552458657
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	7.135171666634136
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	10.012968756914502
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	6.158087834239628
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	7.8138877974579986
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	6.93029016009749
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	7.608845256146173
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	8.735631879089537
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	7.718108102183419
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	6.037356241955339
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	8.382579209362927
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	8.111670806621106
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	9.7989546578159
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	6.211351406322388
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	9.43344199372375
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	4.6702294364014705
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	5.209623217786701
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lom√© and tackling famine situations?	8.761335961799343
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	8.211777811638557
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	5.26806650056603
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	7.591172497609375
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	8.287650606190907
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	7.458472124032192
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	8.587334068199933
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	11.390894117079295
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	7.571721912145269
The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	7.665036559825385
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	8.15435960417342
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	6.287354912584686
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	4.848094773805253
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	9.13485859030404
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	8.449773348469977
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record.	7.5525929615229
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	6.557306240929785
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	8.60546189662715
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	7.029754918813194
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	6.870094610278413
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	7.604082937185556
.	52.89722204958655
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	7.889680218412414
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	5.2940001185643215
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	6.542336063792973
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	9.371474210308127
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	7.800767065983981
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	7.377731150127944
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	7.524550416850954
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	6.928744034861646
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	9.017497939375636
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	11.552907834003667
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	8.232228966693887
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	8.046592298256158
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	9.02188710959312
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	7.925636512041969
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	6.174424807884576
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	9.160672481776638
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	7.376204356198093
Are these reports accurate?	6.387909604545138
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	5.700958169484356
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	8.156887682369893
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	6.8915524869640885
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	9.118325844319118
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	7.45648300857771
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	5.4609898003205695
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	2.4134328201607413
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	7.758634075270954
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	6.7401988745701695
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	5.332280345910466
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	9.118834350559698
We cannot accept this.	4.84229403976601
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	7.136128586484177
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	6.4303992831878745
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	8.02260976731262
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	7.556539134506794
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	6.299204452823726
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	5.945269874868545
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	7.400460948552978
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	8.59227931219085
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	5.68785035112473
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.3146471262555792
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	7.692606753687453
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	2.369806131674019
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	7.842778482891291
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	6.964342654074163
That is the way it should be.	15.525873409749556
We congratulate you.	5.302901219849966
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	5.677728403130041
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Kn√∂rr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	7.543659573862166
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	8.627409331359733
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	7.9208757269231524
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	6.102256734352179
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	8.069545442299331
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	8.81489591941053
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	8.576515530036092
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	10.58140249645537
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	7.360126093997757
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	6.258227175966484
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	8.544728394789892
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	4.465754970700977
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	7.250889846991591
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	6.027918251541996
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	7.592190002037625
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	7.036828152624192
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	8.072074946079839
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	7.616913734171123
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	6.162447657008226
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	8.186633703146427
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	6.064286322222909
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	8.130366569021023
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	6.340876650710501
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	7.277193235817061
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	8.339857472849257
(End of fiction).	5.679299020299721
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	13.22430521153008
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	6.54312441811027
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	8.163555632167686
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	9.013869508233658
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	6.178919183146359
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	7.383423198462329
The time for action is upon us.	8.710594511268143
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	6.012523285589629
.	52.89722204958655
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	8.608516915936494
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	9.51545756226128
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	5.961805617833534
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	7.496104898101316
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	1.2264779583237335
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	6.666915543458673
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	8.757612567316851
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	9.342742919538116
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	7.569431036693931
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	7.977169339044755
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	9.419746425408901
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	7.0434248128059105
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.	4.082134429598266
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	8.178334011743402
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	7.156844022511
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	7.182805971777806
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	8.969008902614677
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	8.961890831271129
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	6.888393489517696
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	5.862173007092495
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	6.959182523764927
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	5.864668621740136
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	5.3258102335098245
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	8.26979566662668
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	6.792716302030832
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	6.876250495475085
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	5.545068219908391
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	8.32255201713898
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	7.909080706609265
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	7.445359831601141
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	8.213894417453778
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	6.440393324594417
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	6.8560837519281295
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	4.013326095506688
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	6.368797161147415
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	10.078243952798461
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	6.248348106988507
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	8.751009936626216
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	7.8623432641735835
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	8.24208358340188
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	7.374862418744188
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	8.900851132581465
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	6.629298367353871
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	8.901743074372547
That cannot continue.	6.166568571207064
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	6.048365595271947
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	9.928902624611768
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	8.107814172965119
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	6.952846971050739
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	6.660424633585528
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	6.911161812793994
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	6.646818641479169
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	8.91773982911851
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	2.8780503888154247
This is a pity, in a sense.	13.417643589242045
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	4.265227294107685
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	11.993844567240744
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	9.104047166678008
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	8.6661095636696
One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	7.136084880122639
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	9.93904659658104
This latter point is of particular importance.	6.914839539450751
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	1.1438227504289553
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	6.564061123365736
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	9.34545152906694
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	6.898312543396737
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	8.0779230085232
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	8.519125626635086
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	9.780612577232851
It is indeed.	11.569533567947726
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	7.931160074221959
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	6.206449302716314
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	6.162588834271495
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	7.913933934701242
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	8.571243129212622
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	6.981250204636655
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	5.877153826708105
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	7.619299126211717
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	7.297261377004853
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	6.610203510454145
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	7.114837467220877
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	6.349263893745471
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	8.258524500449399
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	6.2027861289376505
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	2.795971243673024
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-√†-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	6.847854446341459
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	7.143056930300489
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	8.15220195387502
That concludes the debate.	1.4316418906463761
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	9.229973456041396
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	8.04936448723176
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	5.850622432821792
It will be there for some time to come.	11.90101882811813
What is the role of the scientific committees?	11.599293031570744
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	8.395092886678919
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	4.840400695837245
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	8.901606707291597
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	5.9754991739139935
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	8.035672335962914
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	7.628534389210503
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	12.80876909224511
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	9.34828626491927
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	7.677405153900569
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	9.609409407448245
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	8.17239722980055
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	5.678777518870506
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	8.43673078639343
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	1.1438227504289553
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	10.231318299642798
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	4.784687289712201
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	8.88902611158521
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	5.555968628453086
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	6.182313712796838
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	7.01738330957238
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	7.862251525781649
Leopards do not change their spots.	8.840668015022318
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	11.22648333282009
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	7.478681842529661
I do not know whether this is in order, and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House.	7.0653166740521565
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	10.468587393954333
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	7.690670767279432
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	6.22094027744129
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	9.963463588028
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	7.567590144338849
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	7.4003984329044235
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	6.689665538326018
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	4.193230949684023
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	6.684181949052052
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	6.864006098359501
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	5.429466116711909
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	9.257728340286896
Without them we would not be able to function.	7.977145756397762
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	6.882319579806731
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	5.800303829456969
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	7.466496876827616
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	9.693034390574143
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	5.615193841363954
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	6.9329956882908785
Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	7.238935390156058
Stand by universality and affordability!	3.898899840700055
The real world simply does not work like that.	8.70074039250634
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	7.048041521266046
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	8.348710985486944
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	7.88426566014159
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	9.330451906257615
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	6.571735514165033
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	8.59603074539474
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	6.836779789577772
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	1.1438227504289553
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	6.851696540902928
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	5.830337828751268
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	8.160598817435387
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	7.986102751408397
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	6.655728955624219
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	6.011122035428725
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	6.40951156362912
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	7.174928086373595
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	6.892717609308895
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	9.302453813117008
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	7.0856424248338685
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	5.75191464528195
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	5.501417247235336
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	7.6350158619980295
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	6.989199904064337
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	6.811998682181267
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	8.754697286425737
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	6.380980088882947
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	6.917466696238329
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	8.51098819902492
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	8.538362249350765
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	3.5799712839423656
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	9.19554973735243
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	7.4134271478573925
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	9.29603433503173
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	6.175027113098818
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	8.17883097806696
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	6.595077732506481
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	7.417730103450644
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	7.00707952432322
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	3.2483028079361915
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	8.160464885620682
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	6.688964248665789
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	8.626914641883634
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	5.259444398483592
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	7.684970558402126
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3341657786941752
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	5.795635825520684
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	7.278531028524293
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	4.408395696458696
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	5.224320707261767
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	8.455120975109788
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	8.161060252681864
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	8.401239364944058
This is not new.	22.831507163775512
Reforming the Commission	216.40999296351652
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	8.005899688194631
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	7.2715703517037
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	7.213755968741178
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	7.880915075698123
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	7.527703662377149
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	6.6829138784681845
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	5.985476479191683
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	5.590486641794748
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	7.274183729127565
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	6.665079517675128
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	7.3437590998615345
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	7.670018041838947
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	6.40662817453667
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	7.388798111721663
We have listened to the Commission' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	7.384656606036666
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.	7.053770643655187
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	8.046767245993019
Yet we do not have much time.	3.4610729164529968
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	5.766667556508796
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	5.326952313654497
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	2.61908411153249
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	5.955793632784002
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	7.238930026154399
I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters.	6.348648193991474
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	7.803335721055942
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	6.920370515048666
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	8.897196676886198
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	7.94700192744744
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	8.46298966162094
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	6.908392722514811
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	5.314945257731458
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	6.851125825215884
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	6.262030776950421
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	6.623985792252754
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	6.867235435537107
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	5.757927824483048
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	8.712262717423641
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	7.618399548394799
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	7.818655504992026
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	10.151216989100734
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	7.143393191328458
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	8.862010535702447
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	6.459945537447475
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?	5.984795448983418
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	4.5593922967839084
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	8.63418311551114
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	8.951423775624603
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	6.044928392549384
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	6.6781206675130385
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	9.25601308515432
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	3.1174960743825
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	7.523150528503279
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	6.690924181528525
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	7.561175811640213
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	5.788108037978699
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	7.392242186185816
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	7.579720636860737
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	6.983230821610471
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	8.141441145140966
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	6.725445331756852
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	7.3222279870385005
.	52.89722204958655
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	7.010753158887577
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	9.980811530370344
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	8.080895752921728
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	5.9921591903102005
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	5.452264683335323
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	5.225616683565917
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	9.178282289797236
And when that day comes, it is too late.	7.465776181480217
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	9.136447958352754
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	1.1438227504289553
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	8.390303335216334
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	6.603338538427533
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	9.177920362402402
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	8.679012082359616
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	5.072897407044881
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	7.91003796002945
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	7.8052937961917515
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	7.826729409906214
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	7.645547175515
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	4.909554153571117
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	8.577366603675648
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	7.639750696871393
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	7.5343099974634455
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	8.358126261666268
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	7.776467154589753
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	7.908439578336187
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	4.940855603511218
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	7.155632565962713
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	7.634191741763974
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	7.0918560133312
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	13.698955064962702
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	8.118581237534354
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	5.467444342641083
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	6.63551388004033
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	5.238304664099116
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	6.584710979666809
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	6.4433572998417725
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	7.5606827550511175
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	6.949296980209832
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	9.006421965527084
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	6.90398996049385
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	9.123529787819066
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	5.855558185021531
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	9.505501151304072
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	8.868353243382101
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	7.422324513943699
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	7.857206963594177
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	8.179549501313495
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	8.4333542026842
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	5.744394341727983
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	7.353610263045692
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	6.869722616353083
I also want to mention the death penalty.	4.242848888615148
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	5.160001105269548
I just have one more request.	6.679980590271066
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	7.051171939288383
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	6.7915492746661705
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	7.645091808950336
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	7.95023922860956
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	6.512530035794405
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	7.134461113814838
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	8.71030556109416
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of J√∂rg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	7.873598927448425
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	5.195034458335992
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	7.336141809111869
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	9.968260705470337
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	8.719937162621846
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	6.749478457239812
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.	6.238377279720864
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	6.907669409469617
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	9.055854116714627
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler B√©guin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	9.314673717645046
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	8.034386199707527
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	7.843971568398674
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	8.129505262024898
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	9.907975705615238
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	7.349953047269839
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	7.641444012238144
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	9.07890936668904
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	7.288699942230172
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	8.677560427707062
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	7.812888322816897
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	6.854382404060902
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Co√ªteaux.	7.873446448061157
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	7.63931951569588
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	5.590921496288922
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	7.509196989969249
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	7.2343267314028745
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	6.929688061091482
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	7.020765105900256
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	9.024040505394774
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	4.026600547356887
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	7.201951251951001
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	7.042985307408063
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.4124578827451675
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	8.644713557145291
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	8.49267030318817
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	6.169200125234869
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	6.887420766054642
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	7.818500860507738
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	7.937674024746893
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	8.493351109851691
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	9.185885628645854
We expect the Commission to implement it.	6.055266016504673
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	6.465442798487465
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	7.983242490687013
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	7.97708206389632
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	7.148244859221856
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	9.54900937840277
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	6.5600318190722735
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	9.126206071237597
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	6.192537802223735
We can submit motions for this together with you.	6.366890412030401
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	11.017774894788671
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	5.875495477551702
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	10.469662269726408
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	6.4271582586961244
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	4.018401564745238
(Sustained applause)	5.99022837344031
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	8.069054055840514
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	9.361183758822843
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	6.507932614422255
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	8.093812655720416
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	6.249137411432511
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	6.831987032258
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	7.835469078997409
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	6.809665946470689
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	7.543110230494571
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	7.596997148154351
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	8.23952435385734
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	8.493038939545297
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	9.200608157615482
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	8.51891519786151
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	8.349138877907965
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	6.444389929335717
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	6.531822479195642
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	7.734453721083272
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	6.349504307072271
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	7.216396635020582
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.753734974867252
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	2.899039782750816
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	9.845330414489657
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.228807506750262
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	6.34393886546556
Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States.	8.406505373757295
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	7.003501192274409
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	6.620586404098713
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	9.520868747002902
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	7.972414720255856
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	7.147104131255282
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	6.5953090679996835
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	7.218182222979134
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	6.330237765704142
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	7.056738054716068
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	6.607092701217884
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.	10.205046621566932
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	9.854849081129604
Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	6.728358829100938
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	7.2488803078145025
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	6.677058443771945
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	7.865446395946863
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	7.798498284989917
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	7.725104466938212
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	9.774025556294667
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	7.9407769462444335
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	6.8256554965321685
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	5.69546009775802
That concludes the debate.	1.4316418906463761
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	8.753090917902151
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	12.127791561263047
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	10.752470428450241
I consider this to be unacceptable.	3.919493207362642
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	9.675485379773164
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	7.941513778717353
So this issue will be addressed.	6.079283913560697
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	6.773901816135081
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	9.550792409096694
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	8.509582733835268
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	5.3608422416506025
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	5.298392264663537
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	7.664754777783717
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	6.065052898340519
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	4.908780671278571
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	6.296018864308067
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	8.310859898044699
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	6.742637414953807
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	6.618955886114654
There may be a number of views on that.	12.3032290911743
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	7.140654025464144
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	8.62425974521914
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	3.4884441973828895
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	7.008828240889593
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	5.77179812313935
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	5.870029797334046
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	9.299757149142897
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	7.58157705490693
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	7.370669672211533
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.	7.8875850834257495
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	6.344561781230996
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	8.00101789324702
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	17.96999494382532
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	6.038484451587317
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	7.463962440055306
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	8.40195127837106
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	6.8918986658145585
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	8.633774670039992
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	8.66761954928273
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	5.985804540768188
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	5.151244840030608
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	6.769777849180352
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	6.524535763043014
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.247997255623733
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	6.478206379313403
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	7.153351265820469
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	6.261370893684577
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	5.936615322381165
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	1.1438227504289553
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	4.126415597256721
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	7.833023147329186
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	7.869763356828204
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	8.78164190070632
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	8.785382481151865
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	10.75627536849122
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	9.59033905296
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	8.919501518084033
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	7.745491668497072
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	6.950257401264835
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	6.97115336319542
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	6.567687515865869
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	6.013909357509445
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	6.501924309403121
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	6.8212553786154055
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	8.003350032776925
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	6.41470801311845
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	9.079731298532081
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	6.792271548079835
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	5.933544745353721
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	8.070817644665784
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	6.339281884375231
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	6.279638853285424
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	7.66513123198423
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	6.59983291392187
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	9.21259929437076
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Sch√ºssel and Haider and their parties, ...	7.721398126993895
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	7.152197785673248
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	7.868747843051948
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	10.077161240323761
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	6.776108754358585
That did not happen.	4.956206460435225
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	6.2378464446017645
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	8.344558413341336
Report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschi√∂ld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Framework Decision on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS))	1.8611873571127815
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	7.305815507410934
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	6.885462332989576
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	6.13702888244442
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	7.161678253985143
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	6.2449251602561375
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	7.996259855311349
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	5.05013034908164
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	12.303678391176451
This too is a particular desire of my group.	6.819664803947535
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	6.149433032450173
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	12.656207813897748
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	7.622501666410625
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	9.306206108857069
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	6.941164305257474
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	7.3531238824714205
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	9.210864130458235
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	7.196968514751917
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	9.119947541627743
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	6.171158316506178
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	7.71738222845582
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	9.11502476612619
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	11.496977962920933
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	5.165528653607959
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	5.331653409511237
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	6.165418941060239
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	7.848127136312937
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	8.055553694872955
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parit√©, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	7.624208996474146
This is unacceptable to my mind.	10.950284707227825
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	7.199196089685616
I also reject this line of argument.	4.9582013566926
Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	8.477246600847241
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	7.46098108371673
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	7.159910690387239
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	7.593477432794448
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	5.992467291001356
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	7.325062387995585
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	8.300100104060522
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	7.2310527385317425
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	7.530311692589344
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	8.569606349606278
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	7.674301576106842
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	9.670638398206679
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	7.399065794341857
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	9.812128511820239
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	6.565616008927401
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	7.607121351703767
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	8.57667981211366
This is not our opinion.	32.101763780955125
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	7.18086882374382
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	7.094473091535642
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	9.843286360659846
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	9.095423517921425
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	7.3874444114884055
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	5.4717307311812515
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	10.84800348758592
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	7.558712224566127
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	7.578520424013363
Have we achieved results?	5.856101989828899
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	2.7586431429362617
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	5.644820533255622
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	7.76471547723025
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	10.973598739625173
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	6.958659741911459
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	7.114825998487779
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	7.68764079410185
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	7.665084397365882
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	8.293372987230285
Combating certain fish diseases	1.6802722311321532
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	6.891919228033227
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	7.824613398957404
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	9.28449895681447
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	5.752961218127419
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	8.394240252250182
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	5.890131527716383
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	9.718107928494465
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	5.777385354772454
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	3.9660320954395747
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	6.668606521878103
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	7.113069856742476
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	10.150004745878471
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	8.220661515310612
Of course this is also the basic idea.	10.304918203349217
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	10.971255931684247
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	8.166965845883912
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	8.60570686866308
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	6.781065221272374
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	7.212437972710401
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	7.950225965939983
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	6.606140553803728
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	8.719667786538576
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	9.350948761748585
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	8.55174636438084
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	11.089941195138522
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	7.740981740906319
.	52.89722204958655
My Group assumes that Margot Wallstr√∂m will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	7.327828281917153
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	9.16959081009148
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	7.365209235423215
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	8.217099288599577
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	7.524913099991173
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	8.741997144897077
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	7.8606598688568745
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	6.931837964198207
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	5.848567148592208
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	7.61386915663221
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	6.962568176105169
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	5.601041592908868
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	6.806320345713094
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	6.377662142522779
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	6.931656972783009
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	6.399619266322076
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	11.151562809029592
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	6.213679616255746
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	8.426042648049268
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	7.398504682379203
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	7.899578783124492
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	7.555412827398997
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	9.727492123864184
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	7.649888741192049
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	7.0401432698044175
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.913492081943671
(More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	5.143050480239118
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	9.737561712207063
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	7.933006028814376
Report (A5-0003/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on	2.3706242881652613
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	9.682841764709627
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	11.005411383347706
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	7.164620508763021
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	8.442111672080593
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	7.218633129703673
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	7.071038244451096
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	10.134974939859067
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	10.79086483286628
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	7.844812435917339
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	9.08178256330812
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	11.853641161797896
.	52.89722204958655
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	4.555084288427825
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	7.3670063929840435
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	9.326290507016182
	14.22659668727896
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	6.582231929104493
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	7.15235044189353
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	5.37457740254452
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	7.017015459914708
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	6.285963872508124
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	5.971651885043727
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	8.421289067042151
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	7.461770638801398
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	7.941651735860749
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	7.389219633526049
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	2.4271415025930314
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	6.937412296228105
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	6.591070767183636
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	5.805472508871394
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	8.604356117510449
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	7.077577522296299
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	6.606605596433436
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	5.882521029269752
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.	7.476838695217356
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	6.789942506475098
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	6.980039589575961
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	5.636432560431521
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	7.548477807268836
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	9.57071565820723
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	6.90127272816343
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	10.818005638734306
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	6.670414404622672
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	10.591766362258623
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	5.838749161045726
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	9.822474255333718
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	8.746948053250188
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	6.598198695301161
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	7.926203388759229
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	7.7596356121186085
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	6.619403124952437
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	7.262469493898725
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	8.191591254009108
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	8.035099181504203
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	6.45526969865659
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	6.756593774869028
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	6.501056538681998
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	6.94525820433215
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	9.443946777628215
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	4.960041285928388
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	7.199767852982043
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	6.224844743991775
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	8.167609033900842
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	5.3944113717301745
Women are no homogenous collective.	5.439412481101956
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	12.671384678813158
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	4.707374826732803
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	8.499207974284783
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	6.097289083986978
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	6.461489357918911
We Socialists reject the liberals' na√Øve optimism on this point.	5.318409190258459
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	7.3784065281940965
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	3.5164640687579802
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	5.5727370153598725
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	7.922419119402348
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	7.51359375193529
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	7.432177675565736
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	8.404219999932991
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	8.187256151088905
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	2.5674407081702566
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	7.206895947486087
Together with Mrs Grosset√™te and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	3.8853093408729946
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	8.447912421063654
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	6.15738909175847
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	6.693509034077127
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	5.946415645544394
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	6.043341886427762
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	7.123886991999224
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	6.798190064863932
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	11.028673617640946
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	7.822337144752669
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	8.399951500611069
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	8.118711391934864
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	7.9993070826119705
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	5.395139622888521
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	8.349641246590846
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	10.043443353089552
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	7.393515144150121
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	6.6410214123269435
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	7.102925469205321
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	10.495521820416297
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	6.28362322523155
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	10.11864719786435
That is usually the case.	4.732889337655212
It is fine, in principle.	5.942973037186135
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	6.327699088768756
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	7.574169993843547
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	8.669706169752043
This regulation is purely instrumental.	8.800134228753196
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	4.556836462229368
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.8953907323005157
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.041498219455892
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	9.566565625664786
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	7.400036990732501
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	6.1534429792828265
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	8.011716174788011
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	7.769748594348371
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.859468634685895
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	5.698369677268589
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourri√®re, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	8.809259362090765
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	8.287329460356844
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	6.399626225032668
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	6.42580864837447
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	8.81186297229506
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	7.5759481878223625
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	8.616801802218784
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	5.583820648234643
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	4.742108999714031
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	8.19188797657469
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	13.670809529423758
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	6.597757812468469
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	11.280930273317017
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.	6.779358279884713
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	6.706914452065183
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	6.713090982218689
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	5.509704842091057
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	7.532422293735962
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	7.942121299258401
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	10.010681867828955
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	7.306397050401285
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	7.7461347354561045
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	6.1433776315908935
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	6.359412538488568
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	7.397374491039429
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	8.490689400372553
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	7.954650547159422
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
This directive is a contribution to this.	7.621008028914874
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	5.8346116501841605
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	6.925145871667499
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	5.348667911351642
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	7.607718059355194
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	11.351719833559567
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	7.385673496177288
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	4.817796707363164
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	4.652398345757039
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	7.636230929744561
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	7.994065500486273
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	8.837524456577782
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	8.187353389751488
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	6.742695359171658
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	7.03580064905849
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	8.490253903495365
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	8.838590335850585
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	7.1604419182347865
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	9.93810316051159
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	8.946655721074938
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	18.451686924421026
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	7.831277948076454
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	8.199884981491776
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more.	6.966937439517107
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	7.289029294929296
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	8.561115843589125
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	14.061789602695711
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	7.499585432350247
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	5.79983816643141
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	6.452316803537189
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	6.046298064493663
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	6.845465674149084
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	7.556151231372451
I should like to have an answer to that question.	6.919223236080809
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	12.084634963636681
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	7.097668709871297
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	6.549540626237872
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	7.8344957929506345
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	6.921784457257579
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	6.586893606445681
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	7.547173502174591
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	6.4222329966152065
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2225881041059778
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	8.8858122232366
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	7.666405001844364
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	6.93852627796987
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	6.605345316700176
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	6.307959594436867
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context.	6.828040305685228
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	7.358762514437619
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	8.355246651955834
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	5.070514413703234
Both biological and economic information are included.	4.567016422061805
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	7.03880296955865
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	5.125509680778156
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	7.335577132571004
The investment needs to be visionary.	4.603335919903992
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	7.808924692991697
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	8.027564128476477
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	6.029273435989693
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	7.4585365965104575
Can you?	23.404981888394214
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	7.791842161704571
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	7.519026439882827
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	7.882351758010832
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	6.526918292053697
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	6.774112464188067
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	7.976450974189967
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	7.539166570813106
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	7.385237214561359
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	9.067264351216311
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	7.760508867873659
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr B√∂ge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	7.721270787305395
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	8.653079296307228
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.8134188709049788
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	7.960081250803662
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	6.60748149189174
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	5.931846613905202
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	4.417594805702037
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	8.728251679716944
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	9.03071664474565
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	5.796901925142352
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	7.110305303369654
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	7.436684346034353
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	5.2957666750075045
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	6.724108853584974
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	8.425886863477567
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	5.610273370994886
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	8.532440598196219
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	6.1704060867723145
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	6.36433620302581
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	7.357820762619868
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	6.115561450655992
I might never have studied otherwise.	5.3447498537224725
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	9.032718880706161
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.255844252500912
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	5.750248708250616
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	11.425661597848414
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	7.428931576806489
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	6.66582778180804
Students are an obvious example.	4.958031535997888
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	8.162852752956002
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	6.536588908049178
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	9.11505979889406
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	6.451761759640567
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	6.782550459073183
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	10.270426723820956
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer.	8.856259809077846
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	6.263071435511175
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	7.635478954736048
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	6.081359744826174
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	9.568183721819688
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	7.52515115051993
However, that is precisely what is happening.	12.834591142341331
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	6.337144086805729
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	7.188876745912901
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	11.831596407616912
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	7.638006862134271
To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	8.177504627404488
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	7.570085975438863
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	9.53093581478338
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	7.052297426203951
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	8.878926737060503
That is not the route that has been taken.	7.552098041561106
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	9.102159966265429
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	12.736460992527347
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	6.416758045567164
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	4.814722481680177
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	7.339551372834437
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	9.147043874723346
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	8.080426017548682
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	7.6783390449517785
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	11.081043713461257
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	6.436124911558731
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	6.168659633558196
President.	52.89722204958655
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	7.124940069954058
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	7.653119009559952
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	9.824893640821875
We have taken note of this.	2.7789446335730434
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	5.553665814121996
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	6.962758429458433
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	8.054189587959277
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	7.346213055510377
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	7.520934666184128
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made.	8.522529962551664
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	4.868252955796307
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	6.64482304893957
What is the basis of armed action?	18.588510046516916
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	7.724701593371433
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	6.940148792945163
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	6.669126733014197
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	7.863202547990003
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	7.036646780722166
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	5.8088363112174575
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	8.23086661256609
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.	7.851474188820873
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	8.891990925597693
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	7.559005141243004
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	7.336120359174051
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.	10.179696888262253
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	6.46141340397858
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	8.977928697535388
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	6.6622206585458015
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	10.350162519234711
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	6.511044593376364
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	7.730731660039666
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	8.08232881803668
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	6.325834273986815
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	6.779752884479095
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	9.218909482013459
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	7.715766494601321
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	7.285664315664083
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	8.369808993466787
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	12.273734063079738
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	17.410743306808918
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	7.505730280992686
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	7.204950283723711
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	9.09286231969143
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	8.77993649142746
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	7.269276100728771
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	8.092585681674638
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	12.53847620974103
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	6.913175556826688
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	6.368669482156529
There is no freedom without rules.	11.05378011714763
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	6.553389900121887
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	9.68884501247738
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	9.316214319569585
Welcome	14.22659668727896
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	10.032251011356717
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	7.429511968204743
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	4.9926112513250835
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	8.349368621806272
But opinion differs as to the solution.	4.9407953997394625
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	8.136059329283542
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	10.410021275408377
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	8.008625880920869
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	9.79427419131148
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	9.262147150220693
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	6.58686640451598
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	6.591212494533773
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	6.231684288715139
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	7.07608517231666
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	7.169315429865672
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	7.353439687494622
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	9.190656255423505
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	7.014759819692065
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	6.292879068226644
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	8.733562026656154
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	7.317610475977739
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	6.4156904824284355
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	8.335585516946365
Danube environmental disaster	40.12798592284873
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	7.200724423362597
States can carry out port inspections.	4.527590363434219
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	6.66159974428424
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	7.1793177015005565
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	7.005500455087237
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	7.644517250326154
I have evidence that this is possible.	13.136905650173729
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	5.14288657483181
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	6.517315385089924
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	8.128729533110882
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	6.44293853320783
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	7.471370046679963
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	11.279717305746807
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	6.830666636167296
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	7.758983065674635
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	4.27230263495492
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	7.373328884134276
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	6.809860160394086
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	8.469535242352189
President.	52.89722204958655
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	8.698949280764488
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	7.1432490795192916
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	5.6723035991106
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	8.556017415700778
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	6.620602467702091
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	8.080210538079417
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	7.017835950822974
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	6.608952316196741
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	8.204522337423706
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourri√®re report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	7.48312793248974
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	8.264302860956503
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	3.908521952090332
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	6.521419189928568
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	7.42497204355548
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	6.293490157139495
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	4.946355758137306
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	4.5941096168057625
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	7.45065777658163
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	7.455234105084868
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	5.629650487642311
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	5.526807507046738
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	5.703739955767032
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	9.234424957757616
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	7.765081163073235
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	7.270828039819843
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	7.705085017301109
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	6.641251711767789
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	3.344332112987163
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	9.901713579185135
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	7.593537346612496
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	8.006830046839559
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	7.57340848993061
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	12.201544362750894
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	5.4913576039038965
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	9.060143301237735
The debate about either extending the Lom√© Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	7.06427410478174
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	6.51836502864642
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	8.499834162926721
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	8.042384366517462
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	5.334753049550907
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	6.112670997429707
However, we already knew this.	20.39926501758025
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	7.756531975885368
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	4.865840859974809
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	4.683320654059662
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	5.1090368603488665
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	6.688771702482598
Firstly he talked about verification.	5.192459281479093
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	6.931529217542113
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	6.908807863690771
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	8.10141680392386
It is a 'Trojan horse' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	8.209822211210453
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	7.575565827212047
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	5.281878028546931
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	8.088949280994777
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	8.915878074193682
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	8.11607407209976
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	5.362759475151794
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	5.489031181589051
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	6.076936657339087
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	7.529187220031016
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	4.320582760899796
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	7.3516724574502765
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	10.37190100567336
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	7.577829725867138
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	7.993882020480445
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	7.303676812978217
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	5.921833837839976
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	8.392515713950782
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	7.968297970419158
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	8.4440990131375
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	6.637695545780048
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	6.141394206253073
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	7.227270443404562
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	7.31558502872787
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	4.40511179218837
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	6.632719308767444
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	9.41490814811588
You did not call me either.	8.420631832686842
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	6.9941914578854405
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	6.410797400871131
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	6.192303587051217
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	8.193194004761583
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	9.173168525356953
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	6.057487122665225
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	7.175367196973899
Finally, the issue of officials.	18.540888829915673
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	9.42815228072394
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	6.747642131470381
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	6.991622997172524
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	6.263148466303196
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	11.032761223446608
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	7.900777638025683
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	8.169669899689223
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	7.406548163699258
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	6.782360119557748
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	6.927774071370305
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	7.146399867324389
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	5.548390507892343
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	8.145998131557858
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	10.589494416432228
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	10.73246094617661
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	7.277177352930969
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	5.210853181003002
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	4.733230425788789
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	6.821488157449233
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	10.072682124566487
Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS))	2.2664758031121335
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	6.406181253062969
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	5.658016608684724
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	6.750508078740154
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	9.627280926442145
With what aim?	5.1130938472790834
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	6.724086135221359
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	9.888302698928651
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	6.679275050212135
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	8.144000131239707
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	6.950871154240123
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	11.589965930107498
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	9.58157712140665
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	6.933599008808944
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	4.475046397799057
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	6.231107002544734
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	6.036278651660103
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	9.407954920594543
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	7.6117702220665535
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	7.173669135585993
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	7.227214579421398
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	7.61710001134342
Quotas alone are not enough.	3.9448245244520512
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	6.557959399672151
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	6.988940877495388
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	7.111666471642347
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	5.4539121211010695
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	8.24840909782562
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	7.1924241706961185
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	7.818408360487952
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	7.490585590085743
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	5.594867344368595
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	7.27741484108675
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	6.732429703175213
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	7.191753200665155
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	7.2621166749415575
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	8.899763402893047
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	5.497383860302814
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	6.939761536352875
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	5.673681400247946
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	7.008410266351051
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	6.2595741031573455
The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	7.865517881201358
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	7.214158478006122
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	7.729411639867956
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	7.24591240875374
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	8.523183974744386
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	6.78412967009112
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	7.613985667027273
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	7.260050809892658
What are we actually doing then?	6.378418074233316
There are different views on this.	8.334544459101439
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	8.501629480418327
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	6.077813180649533
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	6.552530172727418
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	8.67957333853951
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	7.23198290611784
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	2.2933007715336995
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lom√© Conventions.	6.374769403671858
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	7.904904302895704
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	6.84021869062793
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	8.388589911468982
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy.	8.640106840498557
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	9.849703578099199
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	7.399417307906049
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	6.269587121150883
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	10.642719981575832
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	7.481777426037947
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	6.64150141492502
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	7.2500109419814525
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	6.110688811295632
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	8.580551318012176
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	6.0655388654458475
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	6.053294462171646
We do not know what is happening.	5.134022006537056
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	8.326151674330033
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	6.797268835591224
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	6.5517133751160515
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	8.093999686481524
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	8.438849680992188
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	9.156984400828273
Apparently, they were.	7.672700650723114
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	6.584766263790845
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	9.101642402517587
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	10.076760086456682
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	6.891033553331435
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	8.897102436693741
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	6.43371762390604
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	6.757800508729954
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	8.376924673319516
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	9.25120986470263
I would suggest that there is a solution.	8.372069958844408
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	3.139393330305586
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	7.3154026517682516
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	8.889655411043833
I would also like to thank Mrs Terr√≥n i Cus√≠ for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	5.288342271464931
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	6.07032178747435
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	7.466529399606566
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	7.05130808268511
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	6.7850318838294665
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	7.734085497748363
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	6.272243356432083
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	5.80630981972851
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	7.636827307034305
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	8.50943048778308
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	7.756506899049866
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	6.719713873731263
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	7.092658938383024
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	8.290202900403397
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	7.442661667415924
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	4.027124643429076
(Limited applause)	5.241331658206805
(Loud applause)	1.0785651321630196
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	7.336230095832287
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	8.145561210605281
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	7.4964143876255935
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	8.75028062128558
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	6.779805247505007
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	8.120425908707439
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	6.839893760583845
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	9.364904087863161
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	7.817370973830063
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	5.64726192531906
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	7.343461292445539
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	7.52589029261547
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	9.103123973434789
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	5.410738523497684
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	4.462678656845469
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	7.806956954111035
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	6.169460942204898
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	6.980421779069473
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	5.277909017129081
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	9.229320393324837
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	8.064600698464039
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	6.780207458280676
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallstr√∂m, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	7.0162438789095996
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	6.625337286110242
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	6.042653269030559
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	7.810987056366908
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	8.248580316142188
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	6.796596823893014
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	11.18698286824658
It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	7.256099733204975
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	5.162702422477865
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	6.12249732336174
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	7.338425744437178
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	3.187083979376708
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	6.088678232620811
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	7.385320895181516
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	6.478194025164598
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	8.98383900356315
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	7.2305465475203405
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	8.63133665534032
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	7.571661266167203
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	6.0134926351723035
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	10.319377840469697
This is not an option for us any more.	9.902469095944387
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	6.52572668596105
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	6.74428110725456
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	7.9392069772845595
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	12.291349808367425
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.	3.4752708797254366
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	6.746547416314584
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	9.234427051149538
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	7.19768435170125
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	7.8250763808913755
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	7.322990196645178
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	6.440802709249676
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	2.7503556604459973
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	9.357276956217753
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	7.530025895884057
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	5.687678709947825
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	6.891643292911091
As Paul-Marie Co√ªteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	6.573133507388265
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	7.540224134478112
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	7.507067083212792
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	7.824161580626724
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	6.2586444588201156
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.8426244090514676
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	5.891299706446401
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	9.373932370571753
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	6.363335477866875
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	7.869082449910912
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	7.410618332445539
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	6.203040202501216
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	8.807920768499292
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	6.8118591720610695
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	9.551770540550478
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	9.655641556276013
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	8.026470709816081
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	6.593212616250698
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	6.159397058412907
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	9.81325278728232
In my view, instead of "weitergef√ºhrt werden m√ºssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben m√ºssen" .	8.264734833344209
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	4.272722691585535
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	6.766863038992678
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	10.457347931731702
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	7.676753887700297
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	7.670356224344531
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	9.845774432758915
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	6.619523713998622
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	8.317137119407679
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	10.94950813108423
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	10.308894924801779
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	8.255150698252738
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	8.015292357207864
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	7.326793443368307
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	7.510576803531459
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	8.309639576095929
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	7.779751245734397
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	8.742937870001514
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	10.186023899983619
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	8.179369574727307
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	6.949719268899885
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	7.162414616935084
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	8.227123107950758
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	5.897686974941133
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	5.596094571555024
My position on this is clear.	7.95487032953453
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	9.144919236252184
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	5.528701028106693
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	5.828565309610286
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	7.718816387977862
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	6.971206254312947
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	7.8043354379836956
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	8.850865157799335
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	8.042692433918461
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	7.250500971751296
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	6.694629042198401
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	6.3769486595292175
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	6.687736348531754
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	7.639492456538028
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	6.300332548953571
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	6.179109432675227
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	9.74479669775849
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	6.086334661540934
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	8.500287643437865
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	6.644890007225183
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	7.143547775977814
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	7.531248106802515
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	5.974114884718945
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	10.792329249399812
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	8.313581448359585
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	5.841033295531526
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	4.733717586969709
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	6.394042282208345
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	6.82297946974199
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	8.944264925165447
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	7.665251276053628
And this is the result.	28.123572906020577
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	5.301032490892822
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	9.297941143300461
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	8.489738354728589
What else can we do to support this opposition?	9.5632377601417
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	8.018497091191191
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	8.051668574328533
We have three outstanding problems.	7.167857079382519
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	6.745007429481401
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	6.736772829203936
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	10.786973588529015
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	5.016591236647271
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	6.155761745970547
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	7.655490102803244
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	6.868712159806872
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	6.385679071193488
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	6.936502385481597
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	8.687675869163602
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	11.42652841977731
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	7.2049928470939655
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	7.684606474246251
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	7.846812136418605
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	8.47830559722018
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	7.838484066257969
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	8.562195952355241
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	7.099809149688201
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	7.533200187333298
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	8.437418514043948
This is not covered by the directive.	12.20178256777728
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	7.149907782724461
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	6.030389323248127
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	8.607690158275572
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	8.203762973015923
So I welcome it as such.	8.073483868491152
Human rights	46.285069293388226
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	6.9870251448318825
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	6.556856094885965
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	7.961566186830448
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	6.92518412151058
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	7.90213209306602
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	6.9642131962401965
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	7.524706462948826
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	7.913993758859217
I remember Margot Wallstr√∂m being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	6.730732874531327
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	5.861905221896782
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	7.358185507745687
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	5.462743123875558
They need a political deal.	9.164425748482538
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	7.780196024751682
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	6.012244613551614
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	7.156677783592209
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	7.059585570176418
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	6.686363121479206
Madam President, as you know the Cederschi√∂ld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	9.345586132440042
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	5.761566585708387
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	7.488972168002811
There was no majority for this at the time.	5.599920148771458
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	9.10049559480321
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	7.8767104434014605
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	7.247140264918222
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	6.474129544929682
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	7.173545932369677
We are badly behind now in this matter.	4.676909319786598
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	6.230395684261892
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	8.006982594056236
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	6.616186841818096
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	1.6092718791092422
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	6.316659963118627
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	6.719364299603879
We think there are other positive advances too.	7.431854753177402
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	6.040829179056012
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	7.361514214120518
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge D√≠ez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	4.773373159342249
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	7.703360533611817
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	6.017582945821199
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	8.466780681974276
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	8.764903677722888
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	6.225311685705221
Joint resolution on Austria	43.62551086414448
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	8.777178602034615
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	7.585850441810841
We must clearly set firm objectives.	4.612369631659741
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	7.365333816766645
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	7.988855728993838
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	9.157659331243702
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	9.299332336712514
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	8.096367841890322
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	5.661675506530465
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	5.3434992726631725
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	7.261958655206935
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	10.698973399137692
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	7.2040705746589095
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	4.486965712842503
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	11.317543436452363
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	10.014088051022643
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	5.975709775914112
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	1.97923631452936
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	6.85561876321181
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	7.346888636874701
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	1.162056305492263
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	5.95614719441242
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	5.712681816666693
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	5.38271232883267
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	6.957080051812666
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' √™tre, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	9.367874620985672
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	5.097424525364437
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	8.260667502798727
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	7.847662415818741
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	6.819274840349748
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.4630121361876132
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	5.161033704081171
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	6.654785241278483
BSE has certainly not gone away.	6.277979251499648
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	9.868200346331548
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	7.265525494099345
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	8.040344206345985
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	6.7336264165487245
Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS))	2.1926893266223475
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	7.278745346177841
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	8.035617972588451
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	6.211877801874545
Women and children were beaten.	8.902447324921644
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	5.707902739383694
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	7.531607116692725
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.972487966703713
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	7.488887297152704
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	7.588973200488224
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	5.3441664514143525
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	6.818517146149149
Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	10.214038568120593
I want to underline that point.	10.610930585924306
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	7.859239093659182
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	8.305129262363048
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	7.7749419752575175
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	7.030944448128229
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	7.349445906712212
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	7.199934363387001
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	5.89763030968515
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	9.783552972945447
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	8.857799535916731
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	8.119034609617561
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	6.322308131946499
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	6.10359639172712
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	9.033897715843462
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	8.199031619093962
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	9.666139660147788
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	7.571766043325498
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the √Æle d' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	6.557710794456037
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	19.70034044184206
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	9.032363758850202
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	8.884577966318444
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	10.647019493163477
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	8.474129729697836
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	8.509312970560615
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lom√© Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lom√© Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	7.172868396207544
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	8.576248833950517
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	9.683261548028694
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	7.574603186579201
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	6.585541303918606
There is still much to be done, however.	6.823370459039439
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	6.37326375412973
Most say it is about time.	14.095457444690584
.	52.89722204958655
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	8.070225904485362
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	7.919836107465113
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	6.6774097615429175
They are wrong.	4.887094613139007
No.	52.89722204958655
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	7.713803220894485
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	5.77096810133071
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	7.922443843071626
In short, the issue is an important one.	10.319348417166626
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	4.8218681388216
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	4.853402080839518
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	5.8113833632743255
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	7.471416373100402
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	9.763036125444085
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	7.746081171592515
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	7.180530046174649
One can only hope that it succeeds.	6.130242955229278
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	8.856400111506018
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	15.48522097633601
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	9.891415875854385
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	7.802329946973175
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	7.264460593518542
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	6.580721846762297
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	10.281170176266183
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	7.4956462098077585
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	5.876078078433974
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	6.975950626558306
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	6.649862034503074
It would be the first in a long time.	7.396309284618619
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	4.866108783195014
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.8426244090514676
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	7.503074852470226
I will give you one example of this.	3.760083010240856
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	6.348385087226755
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	5.1923774412047905
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	7.664551293947819
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	6.334395332836713
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	10.552105648604392
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	6.620422945993743
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	7.914587052123645
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	9.008407738777308
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	5.4442909147669525
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	7.400883697371219
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	6.537154806203888
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	9.287387095105892
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	7.8469303502075025
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	9.139236355303723
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	5.553754397331013
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	6.08525329269071
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	7.913426899892797
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	8.64694465029951
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	7.12768947567651
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	7.358234319159136
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	8.073832546046436
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	8.359618261796081
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	13.537811839994603
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	8.981755618975484
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	6.277386100977703
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	8.35113791929371
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	6.9508009133010145
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	9.604148886552007
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	6.0268295231222835
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	6.719749683707088
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	6.321139377931601
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	11.889362257827083
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	5.81913013332285
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	7.0676084001962
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	6.054188577757912
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	8.756541230294385
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	8.756435031550797
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	7.36644401334451
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	7.842553786095331
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	5.7509241299496106
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	8.98655633694752
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	7.722615649618658
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	8.00822798828166
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	8.320268428937858
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	5.423047674499841
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	10.063692781909092
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working.	7.10931541721087
(The Minutes were approved)	1.6795542774665808
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	7.648662402938441
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	5.597431160111198
I thank them for their statements to the House.	5.498249921674337
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	12.536260523298758
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	8.67060666548896
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	7.7943918524068
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	13.279926807337523
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	6.423763944974938
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	8.330530028217751
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	6.554013799956299
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	6.815224644787342
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	7.249553332482547
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	8.865551545805104
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	8.689950267749667
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	8.016665995384233
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	7.342016901203564
This is also an important point.	6.170918850462054
But is there not more to it than that?	7.958266008372636
The other amendments are unacceptable.	6.609755829697882
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	7.508152454999384
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Laur√©, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	7.376517578958475
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	11.073813975293406
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	7.4522327639445844
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	8.970651077257516
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	8.355965074352111
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	7.538092273276477
But this new course of action is very exciting.	6.245714597444516
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	8.727324263799835
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	5.273123077583036
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	6.153991159610296
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	7.808834747908245
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	6.8194238294392635
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	8.179615183363776
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	9.231930748536278
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	6.502094906266346
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	6.424416643070571
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	6.643400819218866
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	8.510407329174056
(Loud applause)	1.0785651321630196
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	7.47555946089934
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	6.772965215438631
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	7.405655192827711
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	8.82111070083533
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	7.468712157773399
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	7.126533390671706
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	7.108525621357208
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	8.420785183269661
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	6.870828642533989
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	4.680465173482113
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	7.169487730633065
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	7.102188566528617
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	7.821240492713391
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	7.798575792042497
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	6.974854695536448
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	12.432470073714352
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	6.970641084609598
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	8.562281307574391
For these are prerequisite to any development.	7.22624132287067
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	7.5038687068019705
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	7.614160689226868
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	6.829486759144451
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	3.534336725177302
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	14.712665736262766
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	6.328212316783016
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	5.930392989627661
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	7.521823381505157
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	9.360574279797342
We are looking for solutions.	7.046233938973941
(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	6.969017324303354
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	7.46543245441084
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	8.12023834464054
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	7.239462207287123
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	7.036012801099238
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	11.739862414854436
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	7.510108780109533
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	8.06258298333231
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	11.967719495128915
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	8.299016828764122
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	16.024271617263175
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	8.078954441038999
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	8.984181299977152
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	6.862850071837861
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	9.085320471780886
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	9.36054396375253
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	7.165591684745352
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	11.052686132966818
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	6.904355335268521
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	6.752390380733849
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	7.791929911523375
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	5.559280728651871
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	8.103061164779582
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	7.47425160123867
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	5.075148786285146
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	8.320106347803591
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	9.604207322536935
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	7.265670187062376
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German L√§nder.	8.053802789374203
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	9.188422409224632
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	6.759813603839849
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	8.830787904488316
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	10.191562392463993
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	7.403106317274038
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	9.98729393095199
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	8.270043625998815
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	7.897304457411979
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	7.978184439983912
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	9.026406422417649
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	9.608374048824457
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	6.5348337986108005
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	8.01799315815785
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	8.591744848875912
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	6.202892183945656
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	6.455308975200399
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	7.915913506626284
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	6.598807599959324
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	5.8229951816922325
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	7.707834001499179
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	7.127853029746384
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	7.7578768510734335
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	9.538368730438004
Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	5.615458874414891
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	8.404342179120595
I understand that Mrs Wallstr√∂m, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	8.892685235640396
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	7.807345877104094
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	11.686313818626887
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	8.277439171977042
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	7.67307072132229
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	8.569028035638906
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	5.979174205132728
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	7.916744956357186
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	6.843137588614144
But what do these sanctions mean?	7.123356185246889
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	7.776794804773697
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	7.969968126264179
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	8.740860842322151
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	8.52684334349937
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	10.48087760774738
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	8.055074861576017
Madam President, on a point of order.	2.859468634685895
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	6.836352372288646
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	5.940202234456472
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	7.722485259343816
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	8.454598410855912
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	6.439615978178661
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	6.9261649765681055
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	5.31322771709293
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	8.711312050848669
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	7.3163375928256436
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	8.643961448405713
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	6.957050239645707
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	7.997436154304357
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	5.488038901013914
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	6.995791631901508
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	6.608343859226265
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	8.1451147959431
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	6.5216654064094035
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	6.881094792307182
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	6.250775286253776
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of J√∂rg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	7.65546050148234
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	5.889869847508357
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	7.863485375455833
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	3.364867579922492
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	8.242677193578926
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	8.833805348938878
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	6.443086983961475
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	6.770965479322184
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	8.320370914797678
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	8.563663558737634
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	4.24472038790467
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	7.783680104186976
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	7.363184301490707
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	5.578797382781499
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	7.625745388879268
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	12.773038681952757
Legal security requires this.	4.428066469741657
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	9.202396229118117
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	7.607727470229469
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	11.250894211844338
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	7.903438891691248
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	8.383248708302773
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	7.177302616316235
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	7.346936507276247
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	8.543436206428659
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	9.38447464004584
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	6.95592426213108
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	7.205410505538313
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	5.952442849326619
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	7.606637891883797
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	6.392898069416479
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	7.45423171383835
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	7.0547959928022905
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	7.7429012795830126
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	7.825363198539325
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	8.47292481418023
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	7.307857366395835
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	6.159973060767141
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	8.51888483768126
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	5.653880185075906
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	7.137014629439854
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	6.696810889578631
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	8.026645180445318
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	7.440535622042726
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	7.503048268131975
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	8.700962436026684
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	7.115407451993591
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	9.648133061185758
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	9.150290126736245
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	7.370163436049827
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	6.20424907954468
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	7.526390070622942
That foundation is clearly the single market.	5.420514491020253
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	7.675636445467409
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	7.4058399869512765
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	7.0063181477749215
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	7.584629355493968
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	7.072700984201761
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	8.40310554335789
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	6.739137138353277
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	7.300359432787356
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	6.763488360457138
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	5.6023846584133565
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	7.433994807822322
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	8.852395751003213
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	6.506039151929565
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	7.816084356167738
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	7.367999996952152
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	5.705944394655242
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	1.2264779583237335
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	7.3978241813351255
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vend√©e and Loire-Atlantique regions.	6.010484040841399
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	7.131485768336282
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	8.574628520403955
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	6.745271832662526
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	6.550871787916521
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	6.381912496215119
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	8.192675541707061
I come from a rural area.	3.541806086851139
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	8.500607261429808
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	7.371591499253031
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	6.961953892699004
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	8.164115947396105
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	6.652246500442678
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world.	11.413272245242924
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	7.340476851454969
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	7.522540002060106
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	6.557174395770154
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Sch√∂rling.	5.951002241548106
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	5.3956418238360175
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	5.1642392749786925
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	7.7340600184217605
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	9.340431874754865
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	8.975761734084156
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	7.449475494962435
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	7.209844322399086
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	8.138232087400876
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	7.905117628250324
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	6.983260241478724
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	4.8310596429554264
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	7.15582654933387
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	7.178929004583588
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	10.673881109067292
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	9.036763129707724
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	7.425116685922335
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	7.449887359298833
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	9.938819838255936
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	8.655470610829772
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de gr√¢ce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	6.988872520063291
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	5.807311031260429
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.5315497741220137
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	6.842155277864277
My second criticism follows on from the first.	5.879626403764076
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	8.495000419596765
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	8.728668418561327
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	9.150934337679018
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	6.984616835781268
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	7.727940238154897
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	8.264191375079227
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	7.1479439280596235
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	9.19905937307895
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	8.176132688831181
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	7.806476074353901
Have you already included your second term of office?	6.528688782810495
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	9.27769216223739
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	6.686977598168671
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	8.54898899840528
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	10.703604721315724
This is all I can say.	3.9637937774513117
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	8.894958371041588
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	6.029873710685722
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	9.075708382090733
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	9.81499226043833
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	9.15970030449799
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	7.357550287361674
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
I just want to emphasise this further.	7.0388350370009025
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	8.28290058159129
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	6.127499608407126
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	6.547315283985661
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	9.459999517899108
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	6.650064132313981
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	6.51031703731809
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	8.545982828378518
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	6.2063228635848
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	8.689201220436628
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	7.735164259480217
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	6.96905281983
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	7.9251504358731655
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	10.441598039391312
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	6.96517369527897
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	9.183900181448344
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	7.528371783582628
Is that the message we want to send out?	21.347538548700186
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	7.9354636286029665
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	6.541216790398868
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	8.70637685328537
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	7.923813639681725
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	8.484558094819551
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	6.78350488219855
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	6.387228896612285
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	7.190361264352703
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	8.2406166256037
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	7.20403904684582
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	7.225147450028895
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	5.2400207621676
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	7.54652007986485
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	7.028602015249409
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	5.927104864131278
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	7.67095552962778
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	6.551900599293322
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	9.912074151699368
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	7.5723068958186115
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	7.500298974420558
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	5.022329939133056
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	8.01686558928738
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	6.626552917365744
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	9.30069653151461
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	7.155638963139065
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	6.74636807220914
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	3.973138559760194
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	7.0503441857186555
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	7.595762004448613
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	6.43461855257153
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	6.520005165590702
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	6.859654851204795
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	6.292326588284913
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	7.287286147798994
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	8.359039268358554
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	6.8516071697283225
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	8.822673062724347
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	6.037314370816544
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	9.299724352519704
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	7.378104560079899
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	6.527108578433075
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	7.7618718891122285
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	7.370758323874102
We must not waiver in that commitment.	11.17203640261914
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	7.452458074146334
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	8.482808217476201
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	5.290288462634969
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	4.713717796357415
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	7.327104416324115
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	8.299266209247378
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	1.2264779583237335
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	7.108214637188737
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	5.6825376440231095
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	7.611679930644654
Relating to Amendment No 31	1.2284514190205091
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	7.0534959386589895
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	8.640748107213593
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	6.8353650252659035
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	6.904334217329985
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	7.155361562635675
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	8.00546529025036
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	8.610398668904272
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	6.804005861430952
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	7.533014892105451
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	6.913631466551418
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	5.131231365687586
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	7.986522492994949
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	5.599642160557205
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	7.118579829246801
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	6.909998995106042
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	6.3168265135711055
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	7.456828418470434
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	8.203584813098765
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	6.677953567640919
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	7.46128004875158
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	6.017540994097183
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	8.79503015736675
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	5.268873650483209
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	8.098317811007457
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	6.6944070625026635
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	6.536909314083235
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	7.436065304613941
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	3.363345466481752
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	5.749921829520225
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	6.5837784764526495
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	18.339388949104418
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	12.491558129502883
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	6.925802882827016
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	7.892683091059243
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	8.10507786784942
I can show you a copy if you wish.	7.435843977788881
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	6.418481069843194
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	8.113164471699621
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	7.312270020819687
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	9.253230582602093
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	5.964343595734807
We need hard and fast rules.	1.888949123422644
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	6.8469380742017965
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	5.847234184509202
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	7.564949126033321
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	8.506104632479508
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	8.003798165434413
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	8.818458988770058
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	6.190376646902525
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	6.8433150671492875
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sj√∂stedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	6.6505114104653735
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	10.127280547022384
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	3.7737091021994895
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	7.444229377417087
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	7.835020545732736
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	11.191794974508882
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terr√≥n today shows.	9.239970425557312
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	6.333397166690712
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	8.311142531007839
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	8.553337903940882
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	8.437249785324347
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	5.963662394913703
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	6.017146033135521
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	9.351246343253182
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	7.727603589773867
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	13.812444228970865
You may draw your own conclusions.	6.577428293926478
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	7.107706314782365
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	5.917118541240633
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	6.0645644328105135
The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is.	6.587246833655668
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	6.366108257759128
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	1.2264779583237335
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	6.69017231626858
I think we should give this some thought.	6.424517653732599
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	8.216929498792544
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	6.434131249185257
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	8.0120739876285
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	7.541298047473767
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	8.585468545572532
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	8.386643889136723
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	5.436639381171791
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	7.402772685940159
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	7.728076174689767
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	8.414617696625424
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	6.3575917320135265
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	8.451195881041821
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	7.966406834740345
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	6.4960670476838915
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	8.272561418015131
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	6.454097053654456
I utterly reject this!	6.7723509706789216
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	8.339275509694104
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	8.033677261557662
The staffing system is too rigid.	5.894380342460552
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	12.471261806401017
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	9.468106619061217
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	5.827367884984126
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	8.432678078230815
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	6.170050419934546
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	5.847373569304696
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	7.814207530690095
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	7.772645192893043
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	8.338900328801294
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	7.3035459201279584
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	7.630244692718729
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	7.155190589121299
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	7.839580370792189
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	6.1947471716192775
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	6.6876366540512135
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	7.036794950709538
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	8.210006209044733
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	8.906202765728406
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	5.964079533923204
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	8.241044620789484
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	8.26579445992834
So our response must be rapid and strong.	3.111576577971874
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	5.684881232951926
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	7.802184838771908
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	6.608960678097408
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	7.286078117163962
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	7.222890704503242
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	4.623507572714787
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	8.03976516170003
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.	1.9132890740220965
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	7.18132507609067
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	6.759868935429312
Question Time (Commission)	2.398426374577582
It is also 'confusing' .	24.00368622738968
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	6.127003963601054
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	8.31615517713313
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	8.069231079314925
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	8.519291611054108
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	8.435732753842771
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	10.763438437902067
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	6.448395011321802
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	8.095802126776825
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	7.4412023806021
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	8.244580318581116
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	6.2610378668061255
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	7.819654224947376
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	6.226553638891036
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	8.050767753533668
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	6.953283747403666
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschi√∂ld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	6.158900924113482
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	7.161484770269923
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	8.463025938313486
But who defines these tasks?	5.441671518443356
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	6.281000205275569
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	7.705624046411385
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	7.41499148590998
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	7.841508425273878
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	7.186930889001233
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	9.4369509396628
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	7.178253891177228
The common position is not ambitious enough.	6.526827039945294
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	8.219123776691353
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	6.474008091610888
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	3.5722273979858663
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	6.86225018072124
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	8.246430471289928
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	7.585836088379422
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	8.954069532332676
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gas√≤liba I B√∂hm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	6.728091910449556
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	6.6996028568143435
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	7.717449695050664
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	7.681564678678981
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	6.748498173434018
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	7.0574624361147285
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	1.972487966703713
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	13.532266160319553
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	6.684939437651667
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	7.25341248967228
That is something we must guard against.	7.964161299543906
That should be our task, not political posturing.	10.265012015035873
A second remark made by Mr Gas√≤liba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	7.455316523771953
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	7.201486847729386
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	6.000194735245654
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	7.468978998369773
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	9.070355263232665
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	10.432376281555934
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	6.34729600755809
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	7.554165111539716
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	9.728606251085429
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	6.415646705360241
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	8.633618019641146
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	5.604652149475301
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	6.259346457261704
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds?	8.078882597985443
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	6.607707167634098
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	8.852660727263132
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	7.493799152824737
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	7.314343594786876
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	7.4833083652227534
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	7.513079198454461
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	6.2573576280802765
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	8.232346336362639
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	9.36905828104811
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	12.278613427545716
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	8.696526144535024
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	7.186725329498253
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	11.186460060507207
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	7.661719402324551
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	6.868118651463449
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	8.40103736076804
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	7.232437017322998
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	9.72792548114195
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	7.958989664198338
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	8.35483395028384
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	7.185365597171377
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	9.489524963172627
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	10.961500081174561
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	6.887156622635783
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	3.935028618283545
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	8.919500238337683
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	7.472528147171699
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2446853093813204
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	6.350965962154962
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	7.489104949420954
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	7.814498433688024
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	8.6029796846676
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	7.02391873326223
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	4.21461968382181
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	7.676692956034288
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	5.835885301967934
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	7.483305072418596
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	7.13682435823599
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	7.983750718958799
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	9.913416991282467
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	8.040063884285411
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	8.698989358158105
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	7.8907362813517645
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	6.8102755985697945
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	7.868281527787959
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	11.153834407192118
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	5.728603679148623
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	6.6236833960290715
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lom√© Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	6.7320644339950615
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	4.734865255869173
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	6.066260622142067
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	7.685327184270925
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	10.497657270069341
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24	1.3431851025296628
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	8.069970332764122
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	6.93228184805616
Happy Valentine' s Day!	6.2098764899016725
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	6.315877306278601
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	6.469343169737622
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.	6.640352227811039
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	6.429429153797091
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	6.116357560508411
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	8.054896950587786
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	7.1014479787647256
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	7.6123171299399655
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	7.00454153579634
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	7.13753765932918
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	6.810031222095602
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	5.051659019383879
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	8.04352167286332
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	9.111503653516829
It is a very extensive report.	18.14247462552608
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	7.026727837149791
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	4.933560071166482
It worked for us.	6.0937907005547105
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	9.858084486249625
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	7.632446045479833
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	9.368008355002942
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	7.387590872403478
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	9.509703012424822
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more cr√®ches should be built.	9.531159399113498
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	10.364624496215248
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	5.93221976765561
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	7.045988410516735
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	8.000007576035534
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	9.099101947798637
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	6.974538762931125
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	5.287564616126503
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	6.676248049749596
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	7.671339107509557
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	6.808191421154426
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	8.408512821326012
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	10.345324597217665
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	8.411141427870279
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	6.440685712670743
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr R√ºbig, were very explicit on this point.	7.620250067243252
The victims are waiting outside.	6.143783072206953
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	7.0760779576200905
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	6.387255639502992
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	7.97956792339521
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	8.309016095300647
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	5.407189502064175
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.91426843886873
. (EL) The EU' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	5.575084663830805
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	3.9261545157086957
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	7.8690764434756595
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	6.2909014902597615
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	5.9830909404665285
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	7.5300050705908355
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	9.95770964296854
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	6.034614181544502
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	9.845178463026338
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	3.9583660490866586
It is shameful!	6.576920508719075
Adjournment of the session	1.816651520903414
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	5.73446826363322
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	6.446180177130858
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	2.2933007715336995
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	7.3764523782838225
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	7.632227732248014
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	9.13645138384644
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	7.89057587500722
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato pur√©e in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	6.800280786936484
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	8.335063426869914
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	7.783007785470763
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	5.472290412893516
A single key is to suffice in future.	4.322908529924191
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	7.19651788406339
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	8.271132280316785
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	8.136156104817506
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	6.467823439375246
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	5.303541221970599
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	6.739270665256145
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	8.747301789148125
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	6.819139836571457
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	8.945420334447372
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	7.351582223722694
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	5.385189818543836
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	6.707830200477784
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	6.3788526172217495
How will these people be selected?	5.814252654371205
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	8.613444252023664
Coordination is the key word here.	10.48297962075527
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	7.661155546221278
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	5.946757137088805
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	6.833743197798841
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	6.3030780293418
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	6.8057707613499305
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	7.907721329234427
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	7.325971225365429
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	7.04194903070184
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	9.140862397786886
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	7.0242729863709785
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	6.468880962236712
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	7.590589559446461
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	7.407186038238467
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	11.208639973663006
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	2.391137225905245
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	6.650559574031753
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	8.350675043341074
Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS))	2.332316638355724
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	7.035130966755283
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	10.431640855986979
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	8.928362361660028
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	9.454884882199993
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	6.46850808789456
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	6.266636202655603
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	7.750878210908981
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	9.4437832075099
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	6.255769753210623
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.625866595263896
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	6.949467286346364
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	6.125576385598768
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	7.262942948333717
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	7.086833560200282
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	7.12672503860145
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	8.517047137346577
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	6.705339329832486
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	8.783216728411809
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	8.86231373792395
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	8.17133311673502
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	6.965487162861628
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	7.165921435602059
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	12.385889944614723
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	7.200629947163271
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	8.579910919872653
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	9.158900057424862
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	8.25407097930803
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	5.625156185699395
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	6.7312285397701785
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	9.550479249023486
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	7.573704002050484
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	9.324523549482576
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	8.89152182316937
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	6.659232850105274
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	4.05773896710398
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	6.932244147507438
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	9.157961301841224
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	8.134775275072553
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	9.31982841471748
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	8.750572029122322
Is the Council discussing this issue?	6.870007820559124
Why are there no fire instructions?	6.260623992232122
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	5.797433557032279
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	7.477044049959621
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	7.904356942747132
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	6.286667002528648
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	7.760163866957499
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	7.550715346059132
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	5.7515520225853916
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	7.664813878293316
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	7.6187102187264655
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	7.522949936589268
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	8.752577548882908
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	8.75423125261437
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	7.125231176285889
I do not think so.	4.0603066681738085
May I say something about costs.	10.031456193974785
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	10.231511799490752
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	6.213515865288717
We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery.	7.400605219478294
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	7.787739699901492
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	5.680471246798556
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	7.865154503160119
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	6.153712297999598
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	6.191542062338312
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	7.304543304131986
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	7.728761118920502
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	8.281152740893726
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	7.184574791491658
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come.	5.53236190963389
May he rest in peace.	4.113075060763331
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.936478918171558
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	7.206994689781317
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	8.94099211721522
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	8.569579794808122
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	4.104609024686106
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	8.516933390511182
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	8.453319584726648
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	5.767498351122289
If the new Lom√© Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	7.343807082966791
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	7.1081118272835555
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	7.883494276475413
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases.	6.518680685916814
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	7.171184764079627
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	7.295009912542285
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	7.561894666847862
The issue is as topical as it was before.	10.555769915330162
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	7.306211916488269
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	8.626727293251664
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	7.742128056732305
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	5.175355332923937
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	6.7203238034352
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	5.875848757751097
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	9.202163159303526
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	7.2857685477471055
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights	3.6665492586653445
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	7.3518733004298555
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	5.079075964647075
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	7.208682070010836
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	7.767907690666102
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	7.096025538010617
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	8.068686410621435
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	12.325639146273488
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	4.935383967454644
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	6.873226481272483
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	5.148380702829335
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	7.3675036217962315
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	6.947808705224941
.	52.89722204958655
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	8.308768981063027
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	5.024416183370988
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	7.136777065311347
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	6.937187593310925
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	7.1720017504480085
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	7.6480128557679805
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	6.185178686451759
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	7.010467550238044
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	7.040529040087019
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	7.82487354423696
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	7.307232159315401
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	7.48458460809543
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	3.8657592994733663
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	9.013678302406198
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	8.038354353951405
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	8.180117366348773
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	7.945306826081045
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	7.3400262746920415
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	5.744749048769831
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	6.038550054092458
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	2.802664908689351
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	7.528091596971253
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	9.205777230634322
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	8.354476383518843
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	5.706049891679841
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	6.964893310519387
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	7.853317032662622
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	7.563095544739193
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	6.572755742942753
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	8.890904681887932
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	7.520011081761298
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	6.984890945423761
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	7.946114211943113
It groups them together and that is very important.	8.903296886774328
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	7.416547872994178
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	6.636771902542461
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	6.285013410188636
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	6.698505246709795
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	7.209667370411511
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	6.6966136679933586
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	8.412535492604409
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	6.327924198436627
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	5.508281845336228
I took the punishment that came to me.	7.3854798655090725
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	5.319615157763639
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	6.201328532987896
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	8.03600881793129
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almer√≠a, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	6.370301619811239
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	7.0435893174149
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	8.754162917644008
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	7.923398500031071
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	8.517072859993512
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	7.6253770687913995
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	5.637476525462455
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	6.980942014859075
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	4.424606052590874
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	8.552193835792265
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	7.429320237848593
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	8.162971812424763
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sj√∂stedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	7.176359876623787
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	10.250653856383039
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	8.620070182488737
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	7.9825664942998396
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	8.52192316791018
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	7.819701031943367
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	8.432637136098386
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	7.884475740591908
	14.22659668727896
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	7.85779159639849
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	6.789373258725898
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	7.435695870769922
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	7.159232083184287
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	8.042493363108465
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	6.244887619610713
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	7.971598406128042
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	7.386268488502204
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	8.177582264552038
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	7.662581363090267
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	8.841583733629298
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	7.187882311784915
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	7.755280860949042
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	7.327170619429127
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	7.494308417679109
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	5.966771919837559
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	8.549174879468369
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	7.013674536114225
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	6.853676573364549
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	7.892639156967288
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	6.771722471592125
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	7.374319091770747
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	9.235255821684014
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	7.257640776072979
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	9.321262202097026
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	6.574390405473447
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	6.927179552509836
But what have we seen since then?	6.356532044076749
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	5.820431880044495
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	7.44244371078489
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	8.20564454414168
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	7.409597517812349
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	6.056068222934107
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	6.205405418953507
That would be a similar situation.	8.955763261235665
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	8.024576369371005
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	7.3319835297432165
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	8.436344925897874
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	7.765446799900542
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	4.549712981661812
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	8.33487328725619
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	7.285540242619048
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	12.743713013132666
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	8.898074092252251
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	7.02496535235872
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	8.880439193161603
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	6.854490702307267
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	6.021812081151718
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	8.000035918323986
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	7.060439544721558
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	7.019108300179988
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	7.122534875366562
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	9.212946996709073
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.3261229296644093
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	13.49132149018515
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	7.15627244448378
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	6.5789395122559275
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	6.703309438184183
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	7.347815931235761
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	7.765147445057105
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	6.442233238840707
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	6.051818647198788
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	6.200249286264758
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	8.45695330153194
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	8.56546281743833
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	6.673532691990606
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	7.599010666319809
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	6.4542032885359655
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	7.765880383182418
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	6.988372329900094
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	7.165911213246709
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	10.08857345890266
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	7.068884221966357
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	5.49732112236177
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	7.899015337527412
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	8.07088081434577
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	5.67884190674654
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	8.894821551954937
It damages Parliament.	4.325539770666996
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	8.203272084172438
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	7.374472023121946
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	7.043237961849637
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	7.84912120438633
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	9.179607346893246
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	9.424468140334815
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	8.110648228314517
Talks in Austria on forming a government	1.1845944891113458
We say that we want to protect human rights.	10.641734611776256
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	6.462565530265789
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	6.612967233962087
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	7.371117450761943
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	7.988788732186602
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.7344522614621696
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	5.478041849706316
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	12.654388548765544
Why?	46.285069293388226
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	8.563547430198613
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	9.639514782487097
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	6.775466130463851
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	6.560851015858131
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	6.350141795818527
We need to wait and see what happens there.	12.284277295888822
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	3.5958922455761684
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	8.085690702837917
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	8.490965338865262
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	3.354488099180406
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	6.283996585730837
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	9.792655322861428
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	9.066818732907631
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	6.712119792581809
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	7.09335184335424
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	6.781455623829806
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	7.770140304703179
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	6.034147054859923
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.17963165926558
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	7.038998815708727
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	7.285864506493794
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	7.76741125021667
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	7.292715425903592
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	7.442380005563084
End-of-life vehicles	46.285069293388226
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	6.654973842755473
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	7.310291275573008
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	6.347843263329882
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	8.218956170790408
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	6.494009124760473
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	7.615496702576398
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	7.4797674315535145
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	8.287475656474252
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	9.180548242803564
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	8.835729515544507
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	3.92643306715889
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	6.773062671542466
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	7.090693702485021
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	6.507409176998742
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	7.030178431315677
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	7.29615322857131
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	8.513244432121496
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	6.368912038100889
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	7.420107589891735
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	8.218727559695607
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	5.853689490510827
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	7.2046902463655025
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	6.92310094290192
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	7.864457907370176
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	4.5657689509574615
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	4.180802154162156
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	6.457522896258378
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	7.149646957210876
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	7.708976252362206
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	9.226362679656187
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	8.202697137228277
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	5.792944888687801
	14.22659668727896
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	6.018034242754418
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.6429848215027345
That is not always the case.	3.931300154666556
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	7.709160693548349
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	6.9389962715041635
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.4150977500636657
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	11.962125997556834
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	6.106349864277845
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	5.822869881896457
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	5.744113311177351
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	6.384644881171211
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	7.207810454420371
These costs are not very high.	6.1569552270797745
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	8.10194388121526
Has any thought been given to the matter?	9.211753884320581
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	7.257525222159225
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	4.398553279112888
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	8.937593017513759
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	9.769880607475388
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	7.1820896433829615
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	7.23172083194029
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	9.010630818927934
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	7.030421386190245
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	7.148511085656006
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	7.131885245203206
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	6.7636465802840045
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	5.990871379555068
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	10.359070237939717
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	5.9784853073765865
Equality has no pillar of its own.	5.874301937961636
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	6.117022314670598
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	8.890042470058996
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	7.6095277943678115
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	8.048785604237537
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.836802557803147
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	5.298330347512998
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	7.331333583846551
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	6.928105188449819
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	7.302817100879698
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	7.580379212032693
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	9.467219063243999
Thank you for the follow-up question.	13.579029988767763
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	7.9451171662947
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	12.488040252491727
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	8.791919487605274
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	7.710761491742017
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	7.465198468757043
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	5.918867313823516
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	4.702613330563872
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	6.2717499702727135
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	8.143268779636106
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	5.26141774409917
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	7.5908316199730805
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	8.449742038935394
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	7.668444098384403
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FP√ñ at the elections in October 1999.	9.026385196893907
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	10.013046033750179
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	6.733998569673397
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	5.954429904991017
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	6.119478071901288
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	6.963065001370719
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	7.631777788199117
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	9.554304637038063
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	5.737475369615322
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	6.822864654035466
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	5.9485340443248536
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	7.7818224181344595
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding.	7.709353395048794
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	6.522558980985104
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	6.678843743519331
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	8.202306492653287
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	7.537430834349746
Has it been discussed?	5.246130379679383
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	7.643284836859016
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy.	8.058265228965958
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	7.345297202252288
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	6.093030408113863
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	6.377262746627374
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	7.763327676198243
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	13.071784930622226
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	9.03000922511688
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	4.493079898891544
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	9.77821718342741
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	8.398696433049004
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services.	10.002529098471774
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	7.802738296920724
The United Nation' s, and Mr Kouchner' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	5.400898689784381
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	9.570669301050804
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	7.1740564404200375
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	12.807027033865882
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	4.865591981516137
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	7.4990858075562885
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	6.938561006944536
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	7.406498702278637
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	6.427611129293604
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	5.842913938843871
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	8.423727160180531
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	8.109406693195599
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	7.798413850700422
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	7.440804365858342
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	9.302281082115034
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	5.625668909072462
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	6.905303157834401
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	7.378623545704853
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	7.45033383313999
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	13.313876076819312
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	7.783518681127741
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	6.949431530679495
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	6.9698796978029955
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	10.805253645204928
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	7.549647302531785
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	7.867074912955409
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	6.208016699945802
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	7.679195545628155
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	7.681224753932683
The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	6.634417389278418
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	10.692647283031532
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	3.2529429682267064
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	6.235645519045506
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	7.901806173049875
We await a proper response from the Russians.	5.6456720796356095
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	4.447547068124044
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	12.873954823897023
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	7.123247890591714
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	8.512570546683305
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	9.447903448536762
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	7.4510070198667195
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	8.057945627722464
The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	8.645039976576882
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	6.7736962051879415
Such a concern is misplaced.	6.170102494254508
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	8.911330228486637
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	6.78928663089614
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	7.119990103349122
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	9.056067667717885
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	6.792213673225277
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	7.739303558295195
-	14.22659668727896
But there are some questions still outstanding.	8.192833414118141
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	5.678331893804465
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	5.007642729552717
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	7.491264546606371
This is important.	5.3595153322577085
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	9.443296326887962
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	7.122368629065817
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	7.600008232697976
Compare it with what happens in December.	5.5159435898671925
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'.	8.04711724638292
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	8.953334676939976
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	6.9548407686635425
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	7.6154486230546095
Postal services must continue to be public services.	7.468463201021711
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	5.833001084205074
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	7.015490529064174
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	7.459849415004183
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	9.950473928869336
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	7.881411785412635
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	8.7227848587023
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	8.579181263857295
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	5.031047285079582
This is no longer tolerable.	2.509956025000664
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	10.062416075898591
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	8.85623883524773
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	5.837465974471777
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	6.860721109962315
That concludes the debate.	1.4316418906463761
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	8.11862465679955
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	8.579596366269033
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	8.553194859216397
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	6.441909941173627
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	6.940649678503568
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	7.886154090654081
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	11.149803114415693
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	7.405995161751569
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	6.575642268857934
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	4.966224267358841
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.250633094454149
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	7.647043650243286
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	6.282440710501468
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	7.268655624030242
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	6.991680657973388
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	4.320400365554531
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	6.421413678604495
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	8.041937715529029
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	6.501638310365355
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	9.55274837342477
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	7.754051312464488
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	6.112485811995487
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	7.780025195393256
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	7.030132431174178
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	2.8808534353719897
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	6.448886456299562
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	7.671372710809525
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	6.296066218014691
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	8.152733822894461
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	5.894553537225842
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	8.835884381908324
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	9.661166815389295
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	9.271901090335712
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	7.377142254207064
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	6.814140691326526
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	6.146804320358569
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	9.259515684343988
We stand ready to do so.	2.5098629707689564
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	9.372189216108879
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	8.511135504470982
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	8.741922375463586
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	6.570965016122681
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	6.163513329138024
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	8.032670311742146
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	4.922275894986904
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	7.363833106499285
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	3.739581953277655
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	6.933706800825186
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	8.277101812189983
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	7.565861924248858
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	7.375992462451513
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	7.79876793760376
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	6.466608367514908
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	6.998510831983555
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	7.312807260424887
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	8.0649242342298
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	9.345819962834947
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	9.967031914227984
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	7.796503551476911
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	7.850835030217127
We must strike a balance between them.	4.086919221446727
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	8.119791636902209
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	5.952259853889704
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	4.262706461553757
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	6.085278905873333
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	8.600850407477871
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	9.346169222524862
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	10.86957219432547
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	3.580699901981609
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	9.022031775462743
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	7.96831788738926
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	8.292159835357307
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	9.698359546638889
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	7.847606693937953
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	5.702520825926997
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	5.689658735536997
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	7.28843186695057
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	8.651692280437024
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	7.7493988543708285
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	4.60677285525943
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	4.237479824105299
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	7.555574511491479
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	6.4906816739773125
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	7.149482544746672
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	8.575505831393212
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	7.595619666432996
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	8.834964325480357
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	6.31351990524338
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	7.59601362875683
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	5.268873542570434
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	4.420715286080776
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	9.199685301376974
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	8.46332628875849
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	8.073061188191101
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	1.2264779583237335
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	10.4863114661229
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	12.84878744626804
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	6.7685178624374975
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	7.834895245740129
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	6.098368580463647
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	4.0277958211375395
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	14.475205730325607
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	6.708900871144996
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	7.6664110026071945
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	6.607847385192046
It is about keeping communities together.	10.389828013171522
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	5.847484125559279
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	7.7949647581617905
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	8.277394237115356
This can only benefit our credibility.	6.517221295135391
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	7.578908065992565
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	11.720682545581766
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	4.67911980338799
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	10.132610499016502
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	9.42675274338
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	10.888061707094787
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	6.143102462402336
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	6.244400393345279
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	8.004937009552265
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	7.832358444446013
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	7.150489002859789
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	6.630443792375519
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	7.908798147990335
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	6.494465354603221
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	7.240111507693112
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	7.4147951385378885
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	5.987953305925538
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	9.150173335806631
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	8.33630058645842
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	7.894942552097561
I would ask for that to be checked again.	12.193246020804198
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	8.764753363702546
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	5.388276340089906
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS))	2.6830708660260707
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	10.002494001877022
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	8.240114673446922
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	9.19856838970187
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	6.451613857170007
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	5.517821272480796
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	8.533465195085912
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	5.824096694428213
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	7.953025152714994
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	7.746087232147854
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	7.10764251456622
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	11.978294211966537
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	7.496626396580567
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	15.6577900643707
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	6.582414095153592
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	7.499952527756385
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	9.030276968591645
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	7.264115578886433
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	5.415261649376737
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	7.732572038843474
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	7.727613580733539
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	7.372152605157614
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	7.813750746694953
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	8.100629963764506
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	7.898096040665092
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	8.612968220559884
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	14.82863601776627
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	8.861881327379285
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	10.116849087522017
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	8.553103982140307
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	7.488786608569094
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	9.146898965570365
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	8.749152336550098
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	4.952544649933291
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	8.408981867391292
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	7.198885271961554
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	6.912983509682312
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	8.030417302379504
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16.	3.242488532858644
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	8.403313433092372
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	6.077017343987877
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr M√©ndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	7.73679769503331
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.4150977500636657
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	6.4393170314300185
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	6.303489887902496
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	6.894847879378265
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	5.732817360771171
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	8.611811326635936
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	5.87475480838439
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	7.693126717715661
The cast is always the same.	5.693381196061631
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	9.879860014679739
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	7.101627940681139
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	8.371513877588749
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	7.623563267015166
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	6.644079542479747
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	6.711177075634205
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	6.623859750362549
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	6.982988144044669
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	9.618089371836506
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	6.724952999554976
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	7.088640090215479
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	10.331911120927046
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	9.238022027369807
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	7.288957681887969
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	20.433633828310743
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	7.768883525135735
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	7.603657833982562
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	10.168710924744202
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	7.841849474698175
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	7.785838313776915
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	8.27564451137447
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	8.119552154799209
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	6.351358710892602
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	8.35770771963347
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	6.4565858837012575
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	4.9337366340684
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	8.316144456426516
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	8.061371284373026
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	2.993957187699269
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	5.942620599243446
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	6.993962593817375
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	8.28194141075306
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	7.832686734732208
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	7.217005588752655
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	7.866542832949051
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	7.817307668090316
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	6.769585193172002
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	4.47879008818318
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	6.79815035308357
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	7.859185877503551
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	7.553780041079791
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	5.235922264636102
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	7.578021230077111
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	5.98364870968116
It need only be fine-tuned.	6.760644246437785
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	5.569652132576503
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	8.731761168303194
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	4.573034876195903
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	5.536904997614087
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	9.568175906191463
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	7.874586866673384
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	7.561587377092461
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	6.695648308042648
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs D√≠ez Gonz√°lez and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.886159506313672
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	5.997694256280095
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	6.955806294968018
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	7.757237620419772
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	7.826211479728503
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	7.26245233856917
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	7.938001084747007
And these are the consequences!	16.883306347831184
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	7.165724151000572
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	9.413088252384417
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	6.811124340003267
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	6.921472963741911
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	5.9412950342303805
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	8.644272702096542
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	7.465822969044026
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	8.25537470343181
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	7.481600906668273
So, for example, the island of R√©union is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	6.73765155480526
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	8.094118055337324
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	9.023065703563056
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	8.088707334729705
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	8.224296423356702
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	7.188934847899861
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	6.406260964500116
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	9.899404944190344
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	6.075908094409796
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	6.386390457114578
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	8.826510729346154
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	7.376155131688875
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	7.509864541635295
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	6.42728336194255
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	9.544597553910403
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	6.947804579945391
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	9.764239185835331
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	4.518155784480571
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	9.320779063823792
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	8.57136026259685
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	7.71079460383205
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	7.609331905394095
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	7.870978581245813
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	6.806921978324647
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	8.455493402284741
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	9.698206897488483
What are the conditions for this recognition?	14.208937730874034
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	6.546275981722778
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	6.471765582327418
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	7.540410733341047
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	5.764436894742021
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	11.369430470149977
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	10.668831087731045
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	9.552450132763473
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	7.08279412460612
This is the topic.	22.966340437149015
Why is it so important in that sector?	8.075405788938046
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	5.571901733438837
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	8.400081407775843
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	8.822185734207107
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	3.627521076512714
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	8.021333289749595
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	5.510472263153733
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr √âsclope, voiced concerns about employment.	9.855245629983957
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	6.375127446289451
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	5.797291225147786
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	6.29589518877675
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	7.176783535146343
That is what this framework decision is about.	9.837893453639792
They cannot therefore be approved.	2.178514700658856
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	6.720549230724837
I have given you my answer.	5.301163669190114
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	8.430796944022166
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	9.598671671471267
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	8.405815421324043
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	8.566588386238436
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	6.489609651332571
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	6.35500826932694
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	8.090357098555154
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	8.84318759819965
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	8.611121803042185
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	6.269052753887107
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	6.501750432930204
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	7.669117083492909
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	8.536646272034213
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	8.216323159067638
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	8.465824077522107
You may answer the question.	6.578064837555001
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	8.125488924700361
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.823528606200279
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	10.671203914356548
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	7.060874355691231
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	6.818657842507767
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	8.425572139395186
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	7.4496966866614835
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	12.080351482879648
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	6.900202682573919
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	7.096258124307175
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	6.159592132049399
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	6.784244537007269
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	6.285828439558244
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	3.2331277877661404
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	3.680545716251292
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	5.7178210453384475
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	7.264753552333992
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	7.004709471235901
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	6.943620675630488
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	8.311012578631377
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	6.473658219618469
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	6.715676266669546
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	5.7208221686244585
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	7.296716318853337
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	6.801089642302413
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	6.490617463279294
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	1.2264779583237335
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	4.680432075512248
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	9.194496516832782
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	7.15043994104355
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	7.432297759776308
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	8.122935103355694
I recommend the report to the House.	7.220537499906136
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	8.049357546710967
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	8.75376419329993
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	5.171231372411466
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	5.734219878537369
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	5.871291660742275
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	7.0340376382855165
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	6.077607144770713
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	6.766195593178421
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	6.796512923969056
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	10.933961295674884
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	2.057277650793913
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	7.711878736926449
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	7.418683765738999
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	8.733387008209478
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	9.211546156711249
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	7.0698425785497125
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.3888185805878668
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry.	7.096470422899336
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	6.6278064445279075
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	7.293386424132712
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	7.351407955854716
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	7.346163908585741
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	7.078755143952323
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	7.409790771681792
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	7.347869845714787
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	6.97330697711585
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	8.082136840452726
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	5.762222779293508
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	5.486069519099137
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	7.089662395756123
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	6.909946121663785
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	7.6523102542896035
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	8.215533531105201
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	5.475177535848462
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	6.83891396943482
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	6.284764630552212
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	8.3244200733248
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	8.634742066964996
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	7.805500124922265
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	6.533968511688214
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	7.903897629246022
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	8.045344765164156
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	5.942493155744263
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	6.385080567575915
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	6.872334385309948
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	9.766052947129346
Thank you for your reply.	2.2378188009001114
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	9.224598500095148
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	6.042540572665434
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	5.859133406428383
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	7.247273487502101
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	6.587477958457585
That needs to be addressed.	4.784058241241673
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	6.18134961203801
I am talking about Milosevic.	5.544090437747965
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	4.923280768637919
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	6.48298617268072
Here too there is at least some progress.	7.3563296331586825
B√∂ge report (A5-0023/2000)	1.162056305492263
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	11.66051606216322
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	7.3436474295227905
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	7.472015860191524
That seems to me to be rather too long.	3.8395747299142116
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	8.639513448041102
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	7.917513520221232
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	6.337493088027108
The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections.	7.183401840858413
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	8.305260091204406
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	7.078953458248818
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	7.243141900113019
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	7.998667649726393
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	8.602627424735976
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	6.6726390740284085
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	7.509439719717137
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	9.846647498362511
First part	46.285069293388226
This proposal can therefore be approved.	3.190841677587038
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	7.474986276712898
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	11.142317377683769
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	8.359077059204385
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	6.717056594883417
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	6.964663067017874
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	1.5649111647687117
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	7.121176945864703
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	7.281136649203882
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	11.763342544021647
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	7.962221854411809
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	5.284206573482651
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	7.455201317676584
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	8.855031083090683
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	6.853310212246819
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	9.426325783259918
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	6.417202586102639
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	9.425533977027069
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	6.88359810539115
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	6.370983806041047
I can testify to this remarkable work.	3.839101913013801
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	8.041778811467388
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	6.1633037390873096
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	6.84552448727991
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	7.440421815563696
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	6.4247961165611605
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	7.911023452568617
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	6.323052488727638
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	7.204289957336436
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	5.337376632052605
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children.	6.416135840038108
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	7.65478253343014
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	8.029728149335464
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	7.72202523401141
Report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr B√∂ge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD))	1.929592622498357
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.4124578827451675
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	7.42369563338069
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	7.204114836726173
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	8.53411199860937
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	8.194589622438658
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	4.603337696637723
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	10.58653346121898
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	9.785297353938
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	5.285900603963483
They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website.	12.817942179480514
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	7.1316142034674135
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	7.4286773379403295
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	7.106462709148031
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	8.36698662779207
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	6.974855976876473
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	10.548141938590128
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	6.322086844383324
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	6.066696053879192
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	6.645714382588414
Thank you, Mr Davies.	6.742622534997506
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	9.449430309055883
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	6.100203176683353
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	6.758912214697701
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	6.616841392050211
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	7.187088575266881
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	7.743131753877018
We need public and private investment.	3.578331132198071
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	9.922110170019904
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	5.6048540669161735
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	9.595824665751875
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	7.123736505003548
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	9.889388209050418
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	6.870183356218166
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	6.549886668271865
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	10.09139243543873
We really hope and believe so.	5.0366321933658895
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	6.424826824892297
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	5.155963850947727
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	6.700314325482785
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	7.450610664003361
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	7.850761694676742
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	6.9561046871723935
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	7.48003033691748
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	10.355639287407111
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	7.372266042798826
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	7.462327888544666
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	6.651883978577155
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	8.48912751188809
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	6.049271661668552
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	7.9473858352693325
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	8.520051044211174
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	5.499342565870641
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	7.256876457220803
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	7.513388931310065
The debate is closed.	1.0261787819661612
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	5.021311941179125
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.228807506750262
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	6.25609040655076
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	5.658605913566014
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	6.067440988355569
Relating to Wednesday:	1.3866912096267772
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	8.615114536735813
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	6.0208945440342285
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.	7.3667897665863675
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	5.928474652738014
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	8.96381844582546
Who would want this to happen?	7.7410492676962495
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	8.616496580513324
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	7.828917129641403
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	3.9309034603843442
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	10.903650984476098
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	6.8343786617853315
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	7.860624710890245
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	4.879272773510974
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	7.445457228411501
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	6.447801305653466
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	9.58996859927674
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	8.461142469611456
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	6.456174147331224
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	8.342322402630973
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	9.537865472136886
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	6.771357742583015
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	3.921438239588383
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	6.997026009095246
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	5.403952514820728
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.620337042407416
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	7.880482968071443
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	7.769814116011229
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	5.09306747317209
Very well, I shall do so.	5.93600056588348
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	6.539744039991382
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	6.968418826746183
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	9.454170689637248
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	7.868676091560885
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	10.51268993657089
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	8.128901168279937
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	6.33116391967047
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	6.402700922153719
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	6.980911100100388
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	6.963668887432484
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	8.288879043073019
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	6.515102984030308
In order to function, the market needs rules.	16.05587877082044
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.	7.6417265454724905
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	2.746776578193664
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	1.6294129845437804
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	6.812997670801671
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	6.816786249202134
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	5.75607120996034
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	4.6828055494311505
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	8.287107895983405
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	7.5884390381053555
That concludes Question Time.	3.9853832037699464
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	7.8225280550218965
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	6.749695385589346
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	6.134312162577698
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	7.548013031838034
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	7.345401449603286
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	8.194947330905304
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	7.169579214705778
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	10.847460269833926
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	6.621456990526711
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	6.026779566783431
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	6.332224217930427
This is an arduous task.	17.317385813800552
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	7.933435984642517
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	6.189351559178268
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	6.082815888098602
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	8.628743161700799
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	6.574121786108148
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	6.520391087218301
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	7.8735328174691075
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	10.99233978273717
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	7.868552354744606
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	8.897812444479115
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denkta¬∫.	6.7954255417892995
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lom√© Conventions.	7.373556163166955
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	6.511707932034185
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	6.920734320717348
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	9.230251167294282
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	7.50391670191359
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	7.334398606417322
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	7.094448532787028
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	7.229000452395944
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	5.8340919164508325
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	8.847466891716595
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	8.00024224661294
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	8.29374052716931
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	9.7915171249231
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	8.815073013990121
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	8.300172340311079
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	8.139983727317688
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	8.379301374672824
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	6.346442668544013
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	7.0490731355361165
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	7.3332263718761705
You are lucky that Mr B√∂ge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	7.004627865284362
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	6.134289303727684
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	10.06011782590183
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	6.938327715598731
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	6.986679615140492
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	6.544010497298677
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	7.141814116515452
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	6.631147506786539
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	7.466026908404201
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	6.0167079843068425
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	5.932434460683531
It is his first report here in plenary.	5.492533146830104
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	6.115266675426458
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	4.699330980857486
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	8.215937446283126
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	6.805165038688246
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	7.699940849207645
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	6.543499528175309
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	6.288464411940595
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	5.91947904548045
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	6.043903841364218
Cambodia	14.22659668727896
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	6.829872928066332
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4175518371772096
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	7.375645108288604
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	7.304107247796612
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	3.4229977692697844
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	7.1186089461023485
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	8.49598666432772
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	10.408082356362703
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	7.712179185479306
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	9.453196384793216
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	2.021043172022134
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	7.425325260616039
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	7.115039900478444
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	10.398496834669498
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	5.584369911654231
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	8.175237146151234
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	10.603482433525386
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	6.655056497880107
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	6.925472887979002
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	5.966773549360487
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	7.0275397829136015
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	8.05746750580315
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	7.26593565025677
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day.	7.321947669967972
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	9.758446220407999
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.475753851884204
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	6.1251277771604125
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	6.51320791662513
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	6.524364187333504
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	8.67091833498351
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	8.351314177394139
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	6.361239966243411
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	4.943320163212326
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	6.2511823962453485
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	7.398438482526931
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	4.970985182028814
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	10.175996779218998
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	6.424606380623691
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	8.26720347755793
.	52.89722204958655
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	6.888918557160636
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	8.178648182676788
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	7.53066328909325
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	6.835162632573536
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	2.667397681255713
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	6.533114046046813
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	6.916153415876816
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	7.074184669835707
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	8.00653249723564
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	9.303395401917607
We are taking legal advice.	8.332089914228913
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	4.389541095265435
Where is the beef?	2.3047188835436927
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	6.191612285430245
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	10.245310474295968
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	10.58702406871533
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	7.056010483396938
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	7.008805590219787
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	3.9397470470479905
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	9.136770106893534
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	7.95261856163995
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	7.029718391324164
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	7.862378601257233
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	6.626471624380899
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	8.736210143601902
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	8.001889664180924
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	6.434250460593347
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	5.97818984516502
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	8.155301862655433
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	10.699870868882488
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	5.582700245163957
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	6.964881044425818
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	5.251622124360586
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	6.031705036137468
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	4.2396250794884045
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	8.377985008273715
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	5.362889206297232
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	6.337662655070558
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	5.683127378347115
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	7.82124613067084
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	10.852328670643937
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	8.502587627893519
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	5.9941094259593966
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	8.144272465490944
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	7.965443252900707
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	7.823180588661384
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	7.028111188652472
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	8.630091942835556
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	6.797706774644791
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	7.677353316213584
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	6.064753791593087
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	9.807632868552053
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	2.8308740160293033
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	7.645430823384976
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	9.695722176285841
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	8.953550550740998
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	5.194668223884577
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	7.548906152204843
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	7.474248433561966
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	5.842680142852918
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	6.7579380489966665
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	3.993784795858366
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	8.338843751588442
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	8.440613954558943
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	7.0162806001799805
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	9.062805410742573
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	8.520696401935117
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	7.058030680165605
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	5.233276940931834
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	6.5781979431946045
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	7.783441414466657
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	8.037132141832295
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	8.938395495384404
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	9.452688545023713
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	7.24749110507584
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	8.12700633224546
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	3.9078551936726162
We already have legislation.	13.735074923878074
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	9.35801127231278
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	7.193815598791634
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	7.841817928164506
Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	8.348710905858907
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	6.7499419057540395
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	12.549494609333308
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	7.11961216975689
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	10.156627339810491
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	8.656350834084643
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	13.073454308708355
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	6.474744820053477
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	7.1000469364245
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	6.308839327698345
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	8.396180573672153
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	9.004989926429847
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	5.6427855872893
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	9.025720517624277
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	8.173201468271323
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	7.027200702224991
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	10.022787648741826
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	6.903430849088396
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	8.122009930145584
I will end now.	9.238954946877953
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	1.3523812805327038
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	7.400289744654017
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	9.382863744426002
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	6.841287887289773
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	6.319151524273216
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	7.049219362927315
(Applause)	1.191849129671544
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	4.659609408404276
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	5.989671034740066
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	8.832731213686454
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	9.143127538743821
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	3.1544433434635977
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	9.052900163030829
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	6.884073053109991
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	7.837754046461458
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	8.945704089240179
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	7.903202979711761
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	7.845102563529265
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	6.2103593868399365
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	4.8997881537047405
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	7.291380672968561
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	5.434564561661856
The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.	8.461559487304495
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	8.207721568228404
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	7.1457340308981125
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	7.710370848508787
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	5.256220689902912
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	5.931033079301521
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	6.389004366055063
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	6.457467611295729
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	10.316612117969862
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	6.881846534114774
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	7.818677262377827
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	6.478042824119991
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	5.3070393976863315
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	7.775809205356261
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	6.116727298356576
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	5.695681796015075
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	6.78992569137417
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	7.184761895445812
There must be flexibility.	7.388091832596946
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	10.104308555061245
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	9.569809948945284
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	5.885805549153674
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	9.677591893199429
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	7.303521637816026
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	6.9013424851147
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	6.0752573274866775
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	6.53481917463567
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	8.55009037108434
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	6.733135141215677
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	8.203593938443472
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	8.688042468322486
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	7.464491915769556
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	5.1230148119601715
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	6.6102888199460335
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	7.974703968804302
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	7.041412164323892
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.5315497741220137
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	17.75391888648908
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	6.265426885408576
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	9.056114079484203
Is there any prospect of membership?	8.712376171857802
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	7.1309022347844655
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	7.652408745175523
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	8.322687135538816
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	7.261779650671327
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	6.52420723187898
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	7.903084384212508
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	10.557514070982567
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	5.555541254229229
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	8.359272926974782
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	9.926348396140687
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	5.9294176195037025
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	9.303203279181686
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	4.291985716217015
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	9.431035958280555
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	8.71428389495015
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	7.283421982614895
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	7.015629147595485
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	3.3806450509226633
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	6.118103018649251
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	9.14787700444057
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	9.224233318653402
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	5.715397368692671
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	8.84382332945529
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	6.190530692036496
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	7.670409065060725
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	6.053087363326723
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	7.1183367156432675
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	8.354247989997477
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	8.056790223935892
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	7.090214873066369
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	6.87179834031962
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	6.721391482930861
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	5.995264518280664
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	7.566752240255632
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	6.447457384865832
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	9.20487167684193
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	8.19846344311
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	5.292235897234473
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	6.217529354342986
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	6.2173491146464315
It is the humane face of Europe...	13.199487802190864
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	8.656382172781097
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	6.8371802386283855
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	7.465786456702272
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	7.635935262568104
I wholeheartedly agree.	10.03070402976364
The inconsistency is astonishing.	4.100687552846729
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	6.093662412785527
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	6.914369692750631
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	6.757649429743765
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	8.958778577019917
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	8.26048083805416
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	9.384047586394777
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	8.25374520086622
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	7.856055145751561
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	8.358246940340603
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	7.463173095654881
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	9.57041310658372
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	8.64762181036128
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	6.964977124933442
The current situation is not good.	10.542287615322861
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	6.682108402099432
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	9.558120599427353
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	5.591413078222053
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	7.391510982058992
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	8.252437970515594
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	9.498064886986754
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	7.0560812465840375
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	7.0499318743590536
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	9.892751897711285
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	8.617873940304474
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	8.724053084993493
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	5.463700126453081
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	8.205122188299965
If not, why not?	2.384739774090182
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	5.84200745248393
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	6.0509640521411034
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	8.08709689627082
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	6.113238436553564
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	4.451970880997667
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	5.542190191818108
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	8.204723215783414
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	10.43625202585208
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	16.196052135719476
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	7.293563753294061
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	9.267661129437078
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	8.11037407098371
In this light, I think that the European Parliament' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	7.6824393285073915
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	7.171859302025337
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the d√©tente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	8.548783330315478
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	6.846421636170932
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	5.56215338598712
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	10.336367414229418
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	10.696628170263144
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	7.6663320636038055
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	8.578193223852379
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	8.76409842846715
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	8.642304859429137
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	8.377568865733855
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	11.965365892762742
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	6.675082825109868
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	8.6656454163814
It is up to the Commission' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	7.055323551710055
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	8.209620758596442
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	3.3453366998437177
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	6.705626359911762
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	6.2354292362333235
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	8.938341861407176
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	7.51368227457343
This is an unwise policy.	21.3455269714115
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	7.093144590124853
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	6.910311124625639
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	7.0316280672072775
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	4.3998554086766815
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	7.364115590208862
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	9.759295689678178
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	7.07895117853704
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	4.62965135902164
So what should we do?	4.930294936488405
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	8.082688267906763
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	7.570761291314398
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	6.164560048912006
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lom√© Convention have been concluded.	6.901202899462425
Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Kn√∂rr Borr√†s, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	1.708986691394373
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	6.399963403672187
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	7.755132625156458
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	6.705496617289855
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	12.169459820239165
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	5.913139981544863
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	6.366746889261194
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	8.228257359321974
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	5.748121083217547
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	5.634932140678739
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend ¬£125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	8.81347925953544
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	5.710009600566206
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	9.292022518109246
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	6.314788597751251
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	8.623643992756323
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	6.62439849893862
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	7.977524334558725
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	6.401472944144514
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	9.439265622345294
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	8.185669145049843
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	8.180254999507799
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	8.800382929913544
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	7.668548479168129
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	6.441896379503225
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	7.216260785408822
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	8.503025724932147
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	4.098807778499386
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	7.819668317150533
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	6.319434199198204
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	10.826614102486696
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	7.2823460124108195
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	7.057029677508749
