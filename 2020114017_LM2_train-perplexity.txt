Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential.	2.255295504421235
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences.	2.0779597039415796
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe.	2.5216676725312164
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement, none of which unfortunately lasted, between the parties to the conflict.	1.9042622885559544
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	2.7779049468652013
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	2.850299228025661
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place.	3.1501748047530325
It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts.	2.3646566931679818
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.8336609721352835
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women.	1.766495660733102
Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious.	3.02143652702409
Clearly, we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars.	3.003991225932974
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana, where the workers, who are generally women, are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions.	2.3115109105916294
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision.	1.5014173610836878
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars.	2.855947181599575
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests.	2.9718027145554236
In general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing.	2.1710265458652174
For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding.	2.5415333342855972
There is one wish on the European Parliament' s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies.	3.415775547969502
By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level.	2.6508159495927823
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	3.4266434716639176
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion.	1.9501535434573698
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	1.9449636597237463
I would like to make three brief points.	3.900415596246904
We consider it to be of utmost importance that, in terms of financial control, personnel management and bureaucratic short-cuts, we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy, for the benefit of the citizen.	3.447026524755376
Incidentally, this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council, since it was just one, the Netherlands, which was responsible for that intransigence.	2.9548448778268197
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development.	1.8360059613664474
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	2.6446387264834197
Mr President, quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation.	4.908154459425218
The risk of counterfeiting increases. Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State.	2.394775880474568
I belong to the great majority of Members of Parliament who voted in favour of continuing the INTERREG Community Initiative Programme. I regret that Parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme, which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency, but I acknowledge that this was not an easy operation.	3.023245436312401
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are.	2.0927756547559815
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way.	3.3713987080549166
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned.	4.247051855580429
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future.	2.6131097501327796
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS.	2.0240911131009693
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	2.493516803746975
We are all immigrants.	8.563466566459256
Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers.	1.9672336716413663
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement, for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far.	3.0203333033079502
I think there are three reasons for this: 1) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states, the European institutions have lost touch with the people and, in losing touch with the people, they have become putty in the hands of foreign interests; 2) having lost touch with the people, the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole champions of the people, but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system; 3) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains; but it also causes far more to be lost because, when it breaks nations, it breaks subtle expressions of solidarity and, with them, the willingness to present a united front.	2.7359210378165564
However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe.	2.5435770351557845
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable.	3.1251491476414395
Can we, based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries, improve on this?	2.91995886616495
Against this background, I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler' s extermination of the Jews is being held, which is obviously a welcome initiative.	3.0545123894655357
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	2.3730867994725715
There is now a new Commission.	3.557988957440961
Madam President, we simply have a few translation problems in this area too.	3.899220092357292
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.	3.2008611249645496
We must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to Europe' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact, about forty years.	3.382642867621152
In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	2.293095867729042
Floods in Mozambique	3254.6063344286235
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control.	2.280325651534474
Cultural activity creates identity.	1.4192516349464253
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up?	2.8717852222638918
Question No 44 by (H-0819/99):	1.2605856117352525
Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	1.8241719624970538
This has a certain semiological value because the Mediterranean and its islands - and I too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern Europe for their summer holidays get to see, as well as the people who live there.	2.581738232019203
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains.	3.3973586070964887
Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement.	2.9735963317961778
The overall growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens: this is why we believe that the Culture 2000 programme, albeit with a scarcity of funds, can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal.	2.9970852795685397
However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now.	3.5199811436019
We have had the dioxin scare, BSE and many other problems.	2.679185873782825
I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied.	3.33926158059999
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this, but sometimes that is my job.	3.6098277994234804
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession.	2.6026699848277954
Question Time (Commission)	2.078946596599252
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used.	3.2576536703369157
This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott.	2.3551992763520206
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.	2.34621957575586
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ: Area for Freedom, Security and Justice.	1.479150971868275
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us. We must completely overhaul, modernise or, if you prefer, update this policy in its entirety.	2.4479035695995734
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question.	3.6873296703604477
It foresees a just and more effective Europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest.	1.8610766446278724
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and, above all, the future of fishery products, an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years, now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs, unfortunately, of initial disenchantment.	2.3492825811918405
The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts.	2.39195421768106
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	1.4253261309527818
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.4090652235943488
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention.	3.7025112401446414
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	5.354886387311698
So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans.	2.482636634085239
It is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises.	2.5221442911477214
. (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	3.9629442082550193
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports.	1.7472895209833499
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF.	3.602501550362787
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.	1.6149674262664024
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever.	4.301610691918446
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	3.3160801898311196
First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers.	3.1619928850755774
At the same time, it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings, particularly those we are concerned with today.	2.964630903629176
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200.	1.8052340026096005
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain.	1.5771932189374525
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror.	3.6177159407345747
When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier.	2.852394581876342
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation.	1.7648082886469236
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever.	2.299218157209641
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame.	2.1917987213936736
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	2.3869669589433995
The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road.	2.1000197580230897
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	2.7948810369314545
Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests.	3.6626075197373953
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	2.29452695119449
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other, make it urgently necessary to define those rights.	2.7297298753517163
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us.	2.47307109759
No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem.	4.013467865599914
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner.	3.886544360063973
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	2.6591318247132056
Moreover, it was this situation and this interpretation which led the Council to take the decision it took in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union.	3.3070078406456105
We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia.	2.7618119039606235
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.464045005492279
After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries?	2.9411880400408017
Mr Corbett referred to that, but the new model is certainly much more complex, different because the situation is now different, and, in our opinion, much more coherent.	3.1141028172499796
The travel and tourism sector is the front-runner in making use of ICT tools.	2.115212791699476
However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements.	3.136844941599197
Some seven years ago, it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity.	2.9477142934006553
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	3.29507354744078
Mr President, public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion.	3.697918426665708
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission' s proposal more stringent.	3.7099539844786307
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957.	3.382443637090405
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	2.351924768661492
Nothing has changed there.	1.568255433519395
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry.	1.6061294298570457
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future.	2.5869850031331962
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, 'necessarily with acute vigilance' .	2.821653579048663
Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.	2.0801396768364326
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	1.9695508741932026
As such, state aid costs the government twice: first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit.	2.083224241065527
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria.	3.3657382565336817
Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts.	4.298607008740261
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed.	5.669859251413206
Unless we address these issues, unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes, unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse Europe, we will fail.	2.2832659412503373
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	3.1304269769044155
In short, to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements.	2.251636017209514
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	5.957536459154913
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
What can the Commission do about that?	2.8453012143490666
Mr President, as you know, all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago, but with nearly a thousand suicides a year in our prisons, they have not really abolished it?	3.2181289210257202
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative, our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II.	3.4673920048395614
There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery.	3.311963109540665
We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR.	2.517831005787947
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	4.069327746331057
The Commission has resolutely forged a path, and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end, in the service of the citizens of Europe, to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe.	3.569911086504327
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	2.2382526095804476
At any rate, the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union.	3.0070332756230282
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait, led by His Excellency, Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah, Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister, here in the official gallery.	4.310376163641504
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations.	1.6987250534080145
So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from.	3.1754631013100334
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development.	2.8037655498075233
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.	2.327991129986139
. (SV) Olle Schmidt' s report is an improvement on the Commission' s proposal.	3.0952749131865436
On the contrary.	12.262461797327324
In Italy, we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80% of old cars, but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in Italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of Italy.	2.473822797184971
This declaration - which, as I have said, implicates the European Parliament, although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation.	3.176284377321539
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States.	3.2209757538978563
First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations.	3.589942380889414
. I welcome Mr Brok' s report supporting with amendments the Commission' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership.	2.6160886092841555
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves.	2.215372439551882
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women.	2.8780058554061196
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.	2.3612475304439395
UCITS	21.75018985665072
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with.	4.159393482056538
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised.	1.7489696319172865
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.0695879598998657
The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware.	4.833333579272347
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions.	3.396808845928276
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support.	2.5849959522650394
According to my group, this is excellent if, as a result of this, deprivation within regions, towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved.	2.8559403555728573
But it does, at least, make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union.	2.9961015445748025
Equality has no pillar of its own.	2.2667301595771816
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion.	4.127597623739146
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms.	2.2194314329947282
In Finland surface waters are very clean.	1.508035355050515
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	2.9264066337808075
Thus, while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend, we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed.	2.7920934757403555
With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies.	3.4190409387079033
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.	3.241267432047685
There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived.	3.4294358616825136
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	4.027881473646408
Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents.	2.3791363557600254
It has been a huge task, and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann' s amendments. These are all improvements to the common position.	3.6276413805369314
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	2.9541055052011354
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset.	2.8600238645568554
We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	2.364026624105641
On the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet, at the very same time, the EU Member States are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging.	3.115104125633215
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	1.8654333064205677
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law.	2.5981267183158665
But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind.	2.509209666494947
Mr President, I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP.	5.97953848532729
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.	2.4576799815225305
The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions.	2.116975371285061
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus.	2.529550752567978
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	3.569706288309405
It is very important, if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values, that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends.	4.450294494823701
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment, in order to promote employment.	2.9881774193050505
They are trading this in for a head of government' s position and for membership of a government.	1.9924902101299602
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.	1.770833531722466
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	2.3632491459601304
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	2.1877990169751227
Yes, a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet, and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow.	2.513457077566274
Unless this CAP is overthrown, no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside.	2.5845162697424326
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission, and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating.	4.152596655871201
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew.	2.400886016770356
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me.	2.594309030339586
The Commission must listen to it.	3.3049398807987465
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men.	3.0975937559381417
Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies.	2.7720753453835156
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity.	3.594130998891189
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters.	3.2317499864822117
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up.	3.499099742307676
(The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m.)	1.596851881669748
The EU Presidency' s "common reaction" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified.	2.372942662575612
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production, including the nuclear option.	2.8804463042922106
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	3.050572593254603
Finally, the issue of officials.	9.69851922584567
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	1.8963805562922913
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	3.0190744920332797
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152.	3.508277927560992
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last.	3.002615307030027
We share them with everyone on this earth.	1.6703932097992928
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene.	3.6581662260304926
Secondly, it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation, as the rapporteur has said.	2.71224487835136
But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process.	2.435001135449168
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles.	2.3265486433903293
I would particularly like to congratulate Mrs Stenzel, because her effort to reach agreement on the EQUAL initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex, both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue.	3.1120731853381094
However, the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned.	3.6241716556741492
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty' s treatment of the right of reproduction.	2.872051476786693
In other words, to put it simply, Denmark has a choice: it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it.	2.168664997582974
Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules.	3.1291279954001348
Mr President, I almost feel like saying, "Phew" , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work, and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur, Mr Florenz.	4.141718379229873
That did not happen.	2.747203117579522
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds, if not thousands, of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage.	3.239582619343062
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment.	2.4530850929652397
The Court of Auditors, therefore, already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role.	3.260028084267895
It will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers, farmers and food operators, traceability of feed, food and ingredients, proper risk analysis through, for instance, risk assessment - that is, scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is, regulation and control - risk communication, and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate.	2.2827619085917634
But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance.	2.4500076688173382
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen.	2.384844993159235
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed.	2.9524727998800175
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred.	2.3079797819972456
Finally, in conclusion, I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C, for interregional cooperation, even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable.	2.6593309650804513
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation?	2.184247361453674
Madam President, as you know, the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors, particularly in the French version.	2.863364030431855
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres.	2.0872079331979347
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector.	2.5863958756999277
Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky.	1.9760360290167964
The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country.	3.1680890918955553
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients.	2.0862291525333854
If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers.	2.917205877306873
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	4.355040819948937
I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade.	3.1559743380031136
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.	3.073503226302226
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	2.8164099285322064
The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised.	3.056074557941972
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this.	3.4291581140450718
In my opinion, the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides, with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another, independent country.	2.822401243785431
In the period leading up to this, it already appeared, on the basis of the initial drafts, that the Commission had made very important pledges.	3.4354164341463553
Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal.	2.427197722215664
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety, particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection.	2.1479881458718926
Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates.	2.119355278171737
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	2.7823433177705548
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself?	4.021551546274431
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.688182764480455
If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up.	3.3139466525247943
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	2.5903138623901723
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	2.2725210346733298
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues.	3.187504534261424
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax, but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue.	3.0962788295555073
In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important.	3.224712656168039
For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law.	2.225869809176417
In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position.	3.1072992624217695
These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms.	2.2997567765977562
So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place.	4.723431043156523
Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences.	3.750307341164639
The common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the European Union. This is the reason for the oral question to the Council and Commission which we have tabled with 37 other Members.	3.651105076140281
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves.	2.604520101100214
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997.	2.36465102780972
.	77.3301660757284
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248.	2.0780452302283337
As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.	3.351889239429905
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded.	2.085002244133943
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility.	1.516251654280875
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies.	3.248099903803175
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	3.273341183997357
However, I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament's Committee on the Environment and the Council.	4.1462164274420195
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative.	3.9392638434851306
Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union.	3.324760803241923
Last month, as Romano Prodi has just said, we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September.	2.455236342220165
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature.	2.172120509183714
Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993.	2.8381032525977257
For our part, we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the European position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere, because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the Union' s image and to the Union' s own particular identity.	2.9358455271391914
Finally, under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines.	2.359155624613623
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words.	2.429813641257234
We all have, as it were, our histories to live with, but it is important that business has legal certainty.	2.784632576925385
We know that you have an important role in this.	5.901375075628408
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives.	3.3459224252860946
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	3.277440755813087
Spain and Franco were not one and the same.	1.968730250144525
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	2.3598706843182553
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal.	2.115584330724531
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	4.4635060214113675
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects.	3.053210858355117
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there.	2.912177845315049
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	2.7572278128181034
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission.	1.7612774929535375
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out.	2.1746611379934992
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	2.3047356644191996
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace.	2.9244642027824863
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments.	1.5102708734619974
When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call "les pures et dures" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions.	2.460263054271464
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.	4.299723581956784
We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living.	2.687637356809312
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this.	2.357913115861431
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95, and they have already published their corresponding estimates.	2.3636429430027115
The Committee on the Environment' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is, in my view, to be welcomed and worthy of emulation.	4.323723496381589
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration.	3.297300391732883
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics.	3.845630035582576
Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman.	3.6942451179411413
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	2.309967478887366
Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions.	2.772238784664032
Not only is this coordination essential but, as we stated in our opinion, exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential.	2.753027149625872
If we look at the democratic stability of the region, it could perhaps be said that it was the break-up of Yugoslavia that caused the current situation, but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development.	3.2744089506049057
Parliament voted in favour of this text.	3.4084254119079795
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it.	3.4924455671374566
It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive.	2.5763696349469316
However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives.	4.603920719006397
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.2380240562922227
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	2.606314656893081
Never have the parties been so determined.	1.6485109356205532
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.	3.423431022572225
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them.	4.818921407384356
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support!	3.801459352545711
The Commissioner also more than hinted, of course, that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the Danish early retirement pension scheme before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-Danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions, due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the Danish system.	2.8208847221116007
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	4.7592614233047765
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	2.136773155545056
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected.	2.8537201312895837
This is because the 15% increase is nominal and not real, granted that average yearly inflation in the Community during those years was approximately 2%.	2.0292928212188492
We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously.	1.92438232641183
Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty.	3.4252380672098703
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same.	2.1167133569953926
The Commission' s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding.	3.4259702583362355
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds.	2.97388069793315
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect.	3.289301702643398
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation.	3.784542873050947
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries.	3.351277933608283
When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.	2.7979690279503555
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive.	4.245908381235719
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material.	3.6117189529959033
I did not defend attacks on civilians.	2.388019780129551
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for a Community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development (URBAN).	2.688780574509817
I am not one of those MEPs who thinks that it is essential to adopt "extremist" amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the Council of Ministers.	2.692393251319296
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	3.0553223795652205
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	2.238708394443803
I can assure you here today that the Commission, in exercising its risk management functions, will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority.	3.186289520974589
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission.	2.8449737104374595
I do not know what Syria and Israel will want or be able to do in reality, but I do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold, colourless, artificial neon bulbs in our lamps, which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium.	3.499278983351612
Climate change, global resources, river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future.	1.6314964962529912
I think that the answer is brief and clear.	4.143773342914331
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration, the judiciary and, most importantly of all, the police force?	3.0738002056357736
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion.	1.7689843339261513
	32.62528478497609
Mr Andersson' s report demands social convergence, that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the EU.	2.610807905310393
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas.	3.96941592113411
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based, and, thus, opportunities for growth and investment will also improve.	2.5325678146773183
So let us contact the United States now!	3.740228298083499
They see us killing each other.	2.0671126974828207
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties.	4.387499821166733
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures, in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities.	4.649548906552305
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	3.5884607477960384
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process.	3.8182975590874095
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available.	3.904871341255227
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period.	2.1224142853084795
Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can.	3.4939344900064615
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned, it comes under competition.	3.907464474533496
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	3.7825052212590475
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives, then it is a mistake to keep it.	3.7802256473889484
Koch Report (A5-0105/1999)	1.1705018427742722
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards, which used to be a common feature in our Member States, would then disappear.	2.70449286833517
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol.	2.6632587535300885
In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next?	2.7947670505112416
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking.	3.3428703965627142
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently.	2.2424294974207317
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved.	3.7811894878838954
I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly.	3.5540287650920086
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action, among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social, as well as economic, development of a people.	3.41075021221846
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy.	3.765152857389314
However, on this occasion, the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord.	3.0632791742711762
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	3.531300984453408
Here again, Commissioner, the ball is in your court.	3.0726528097037495
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good.	3.4614007663286874
In my opinion, we should look further into this point, and I also think that the Marpol Treaty, which comes into effect in 2001, should be looked at very closely.	3.5178376233174466
After the debacle in Seattle, our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty.	2.5939844365430917
Mr President, why do women need their rightful share in political decision making?	2.9134617172871695
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow' s vote.	2.6862703965205466
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance.	2.767476362047865
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.9697653953137366
Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	2.821998453408558
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.	3.5649595545604518
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	1.8153024763952819
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think.	2.899064860875421
Does the Commission support the Council?	4.176857436129676
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	2.8467991667001074
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here.	1.6865854430331648
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are.	2.1461982470966507
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives.	3.4079239227413227
To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff.	3.090267364944175
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments.	2.143499330221816
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues.	3.480961291230999
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?	1.844404874578726
I ask for your support.	2.278425493961966
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state.	2.559771676141346
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market, to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures.	2.900884593752168
Secondly, the financial contributions.	9.096932966028842
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances.	1.6322767813940318
It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers.	2.529548010343438
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament.	2.4666091540972515
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle.	1.907721412249762
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised.	3.3192748731232844
Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden.	3.7815293520077398
This too is unacceptable in my view.	3.235597370500766
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain.	2.316769226024417
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year.	2.269435012918147
With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that.	2.710675277397184
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	4.276669970535829
As a king sport fisherman myself, I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.	2.591166534362275
That makes it a question of health, not just approximating laws, which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152, that is to say with codecision by Parliament.	3.4656438445770266
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments.	2.4919797119654628
The Commission proposes redistributing the INTERREG funding as follows: between 50 and 80% for strand A, 6% for strand C, and the remainder for strand B, i.e. from 14 up to a maximum of 44%.	2.6929331948060575
The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000.	2.7839194543244283
Question No 47 by (H-0088/00):	1.1672026996941478
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material.	2.991436089601128
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	2.2417416063738163
What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow?	2.562535980873858
As rightly said by the rapporteur, both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval.	2.793980692270422
In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	3.0616211881177207
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	2.639035843814617
It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, "the brown plague" as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory.	2.850131349456867
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	2.1729560781693276
I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco' s view.	2.153635316216098
The Commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information, together with penal sanctions, preventive measures and the pooling of experience.	2.899974950859079
What establishes a recognised minority?	1.4333270383392185
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	3.04899708549985
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment.	3.1299894666277166
Mr Medina Ortega asked me some very concrete questions.	1.771049924152513
The denominations of the euro are well known.	5.7079835033122945
I think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which Mr Meijer has warned us so vehemently, to wit, that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend.	2.702252978304275
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis.	2.965126201640405
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States.	2.6890953396940747
CULTURE 2000	16.37084607672751
Report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Draft Framework Decision on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS))	1.9424185982154367
In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities.	2.5116517260321767
In our view, the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits, as reflected in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Treaty of Maastricht, which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of GDP at market prices in the various Member States.	2.6540784632125014
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	2.0935687752232446
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic.	2.753542730632382
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest.	3.6210394917257394
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	3.179296294211241
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern?	1.7056454663704694
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous.	3.730136310142175
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers.	2.812156028817487
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	3.898405583804119
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector.	2.919298726997338
We hope that we can count on the support of Parliament, and - why not say it - of the Council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives, so that the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible, thus allowing us all to contribute, in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realisation of this project, which is, without a doubt, the "jewel in the crown" of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.939006293897
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	3.2455216982777553
The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council?	3.473453413468386
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days.	2.6897440054724786
I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work.	3.3987448420061876
The Commission is correct in stating that the Union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation.	3.2489531424756386
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection.	4.154564512624469
The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way.	3.0091323160684267
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced.	3.9226199403967885
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	3.8289419889401217
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us.	2.7415194578076902
The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation.	2.544152621531531
They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population.	3.8052237007090417
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science.	3.213147728051177
In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions.	3.2034346611341498
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	2.212086387321722
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	3.4754589881616287
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters.	4.274153068515935
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General.	2.559677068077422
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter?	3.625121166722782
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces, to which they committed themselves, as quickly as they would like.	3.313915812436147
The directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the EU' s treaty concerning the manufacturer' s liability.	3.0897975316513984
Mr President, with the implementation of INTERREG III, European cooperation policy is entering a new phase.	4.485333912342108
At this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-Nazis in the government of a European Union Member State, I must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone.	3.1991704500325437
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is.	2.6398481025144367
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	4.458375482440117
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	2.723060493494465
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now.	3.3944879473135847
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	3.350028933536942
Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect.	2.8959485184058043
It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved.	3.3434069999246154
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies.	1.7205840144543023
However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change.	3.5791357969354864
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe, providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it.	3.8998439889597543
Secondly, at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU.	2.8249911841578244
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase, this must not be an excuse for inertia.	3.9703787372815538
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to.	3.8039815689493977
- (FR) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century.	3.0998228248825113
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind.	3.220918255619076
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	2.528141791866679
It is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further European integration. I say this without being the slightest bit ironical about the highly respectable position of Mr Berthu and his group, but it is no coincidence that the European Council' s decision is supported by those who are, after all, in Parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration.	2.839914978787518
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.	3.89828186556855
And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries.	2.9882459269118997
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island.	2.609088860755713
However, we do not have to resort to extreme solutions, as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report.	3.179252433462511
This has now been done.	2.5475843698751928
Firstly, to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies, subsequently, following invitation to tender, to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations.	2.1562360643761354
My question, Commissioner Byrne is this: the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade.	2.0532400885001474
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance, and that they should be given one more référendaire.	3.823643920371343
As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases.	2.335562623560645
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe, and for the area of freedom, security and justice in particular.	2.823303086103828
At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies, notably the same Financial Controller, the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General."	2.552833257054815
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force.	2.703933294894135
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet.	2.7989883628703383
In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants.	3.038030835397884
I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints.	4.43861799285639
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	5.895456349449935
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	2.025924133339385
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	3.660661992985629
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	2.5031090564847016
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents' era and their parents' era and, of course, is living in the current era. We can also see into the era in which our children will live.	2.4038754752890497
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities.	2.8017588728508085
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	2.516922854837349
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area.	2.8117770862178
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started, the Commission has already developed the new instrument, entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.	2.907543071877764
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	3.546816015583036
Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles.	4.875017956180976
Thank you, Mr Wurtz.	5.724856747574616
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant.	1.7132082741923258
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety.	3.1345720778525483
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn, is the lowest in the whole of Europe.	2.596356891651913
In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied.	2.3385226016912037
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future.	2.1957075566729203
In addition, we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union, for there is a lack of supervision in this area.	4.635147890915502
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation.	1.9661562251921532
Parliament played a crucial role in Europe's response to the BSE crisis.	2.768498910407043
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.	2.9335593080832996
In the joint resolution, we ask the Council and the Member States to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures, giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence.	2.9051625330893724
How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara?	3.7286994625549195
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured.	1.7643215499524294
The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted.	2.952406069604339
I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier.	3.8858746941631113
You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war.	2.4728517817409945
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document.	1.611125389954166
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration.	2.23645847043772
Firstly, I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who, on a daily basis, have had to reassure their constituents, organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services.	2.6862832001891905
It is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference.	3.460803370626503
Nevertheless, I recommend that we start, in the hope that the Commissioner will be able to follow the debate, and particularly the rapporteur' s speech, from her office, if that is where she still is.	3.8515543281417006
For you, the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa.	2.1454252390497297
It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty).	3.0762952307433156
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	2.7703969147862373
Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet.	2.393097107219915
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union, in the majority of States, as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects.	3.1410807575184005
This brings home the connections which bind us together.	1.406641492599649
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies.	2.589052318526059
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe.	2.072893602719529
This goes to show just how topical this subject is.	2.2141786317931906
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs.	2.213316973195645
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise.	2.4113572629983184
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	2.9078643399240702
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document.	2.128227922103006
Mr President, just before I went down into the Chamber, I received an e-mail with a quite emotional description from a Swedish woman who had chosen to spend New Year' s Eve on the French coast in Brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives.	1.9266127879197883
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	2.840482600404097
Once again, all your fine examples, your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground.	2.4570522817729814
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities.	2.7235098402729387
In the world of new technologies, the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are.	3.111614614073402
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal.	3.723054381343549
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications.	3.5035979292476243
Question No 2 by (H-0024/00):	1.1672026996941478
Secondly, as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in?	3.6911822261660094
The Parliament, the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda.	3.997221332114894
We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	3.1048292942594915
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds.	3.065312569517735
(PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	2.734346266048003
And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy.	3.303656564159232
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	1.9957671123010663
Mr President, all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds.	2.247109724436884
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.	3.973673593067003
But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground.	2.478155036168715
Paragraph D points out that "the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils.	2.9158417981585685
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	2.868693196558702
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work, which has been carried out under difficult conditions.	4.056860828533195
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.1554624779629346
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.	4.016786313110012
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis.	5.229220210126861
Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment.	2.8318236178175793
Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation.	2.927150916175122
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	2.8411425164692106
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.	2.268318469164487
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly.	2.659760786609074
That is unacceptable in a democracy.	2.3532793767702214
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed.	2.3460957861301974
They must be non-discriminatory in their application, that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin.	3.184275767876524
The Financial Regulation should be amended.	3.4576879816317447
I have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the Commission.	3.4549447206378643
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	3.893063949806147
I would like to emphasise, however, that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing.	3.819741997982008
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail, except for the fact that a time limit had been decided.	2.960367885276075
Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version.	3.5830970047205164
The results are certainly not what we expected.	3.1156501270544235
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	3.669973056495725
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter.	3.1179042496649774
In other words, we do not need to re-negotiate the text; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive.	3.1289732715674656
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	3.049018102503744
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence.	3.386148147669837
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it.	5.022513048757271
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance.	2.060212581206454
So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	3.005673627855536
Another challenge is presented by technical development.	1.6608288714412471
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council.	3.1986105385656662
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7.	2.350072521423522
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen, but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course.	3.266350911705623
Do forgive me.	1.6843789170257146
I would ask you to support this common position.	3.6079243258444302
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García, addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, contained a remark regarding the IGC.	2.423312153302362
Mr President, money does not smell, as the Romans would say.	4.826916052725541
Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for.	2.7116207390891263
The collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the European works council directive constitute our legal framework, protecting the workers' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively.	2.542502441255387
The UN has a peace plan.	1.8688042816437365
If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty.	4.3317974788849005
Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector.	2.9338887697377674
Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles.	2.4823257517273167
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either?	2.2443449118200554
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history.	2.7929259058659843
Subject: Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality (gender mainstreaming).	2.4729804832030067
The Mediterranean, particularly in some zones, is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value.	2.9371130016112224
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules.	2.6007965201314938
What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days.	2.9214235949945113
There are two reasons why we are saying no.	3.614328044068514
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	3.621891419149041
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle.	2.420976642046524
We have to admit that our European sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect.	3.330511929704767
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	2.1939969414186007
The fourth group is legal certainty.	1.5061537694858664
Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system.	2.517476431066867
Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	2.3889645905214314
The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	2.590250337780112
The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors.	2.525691646029
Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence.	4.289300939201319
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.	2.6949119622340594
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees, the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22.	3.1855561427859858
Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets.	3.099585345447985
According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea.	2.0135292527405655
Thirdly, we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy.	3.206656936642665
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility.	2.7528938075231353
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab.	2.033431056090926
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities.	2.288775048280547
Mr President, I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and, in common with others, express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence.	3.7082527395710567
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.	3.107147752037903
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	2.3515456477257133
Mr President, Mr Langen, ladies and gentlemen, as our rapporteur mentioned, we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme.	4.151860054985189
(Loud applause)	1.1492569002612767
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution, that is, it must not entail more risks.	3.3036693998516053
In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law.	4.878233289129654
In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse.	4.3485536959009155
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed.	3.0770715431990623
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds.	3.1914289823564785
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	3.0529802711921876
Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle.	3.1194473126288167
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency, we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.3478908524225055
That is how the common position has been worded.	3.3090170311101774
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	3.057206518544304
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council.	2.489522314625939
Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage.	3.7915338322801273
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	2.590256439302526
Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed.	3.1020478249109864
Therefore, my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits, which have brought results in cooperation, could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions, who have the odds stacked against them.	3.2770637090529733
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms.	3.187203268506337
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987.	2.870580390170198
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.	2.8501609708151268
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks.	2.618451380153836
Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand.	2.6059529399922887
Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time.	2.493695817023632
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe.	1.548226187177548
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets.	2.4565753729585764
The basis is monetary cooperation, which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy.	2.4983973026947224
That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	3.014785754939564
It is therefore meaningless, and often impossible, directly to transfer projects from LIFE to other instruments.	2.116087783821639
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties?	2.339657487266818
Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us!	1.7092111979090119
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region, unfortunately, I can testify to this.	4.176201739593795
I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States.	2.5658237300379123
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	3.183117879753261
Although there is this disagreement, I should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout Europe.	2.5628128054610038
The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy!	3.3612961607084695
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself.	2.8773669666630313
In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on.	3.5220103261016886
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	3.5157850453905546
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo.	3.8312882786217113
There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts.	3.196285105891876
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	1.9772239619371803
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems.	2.9872886358787736
We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year.	2.8772498568219502
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	3.844488200839999
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations.	2.49480369152233
However, I find these passports inadequate.	4.206061244920958
For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval.	2.1641197378781563
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	3.382767716560676
Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything.	3.0363406817911316
And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership.	2.5198486601908616
That is my conclusion today.	2.979115887513328
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement.	4.518941484693651
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.	4.202352538365606
Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner.	2.686012870146952
Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open.	3.1559940900942447
Here, we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women, and the agencies that represent them, in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes.	3.4638558214825217
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities.	3.052121718798605
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this.	3.6160132614148655
It is best to wait for that debate which, I understand, will take place fairly soon.	3.3137597690592906
It is good that spending has become focused, as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds.	1.8497656272610659
Thus, Amendment No 6, while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations, requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission.	2.9608259224124085
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test?	2.217228884193235
I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	2.860977917438647
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.	3.094182680534548
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today.	3.1880886501882317
However, I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General, because I think they were absolutely right.	3.0611934285105638
Since no one wishes to speak, I shall put this proposal to the vote.	3.614044529568015
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".	2.976862387152434
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	1.8991672029491704
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.	2.55525480779829
I hope that this is a misunderstanding.	9.927332219678016
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa.	3.385524603916536
In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment.	2.7766060831409516
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations.	2.4443510846170615
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light, doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds.	2.0900634913964953
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.	3.5771315513236424
I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions.	4.2381651134055875
Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council.	3.183484448097997
Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.	2.5798625642377138
My position on this is clear.	3.3324813831571642
. (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP).	2.5847157255996
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.	2.2239682555582934
An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future.	3.220554660892441
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation.	1.8120878369914375
Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure.	4.331934567187675
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them, because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes.	3.2444124061141806
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola.	2.8203044214446082
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete.	2.7534379982246264
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.	1.9691511427213213
. Mr President, this has been a very useful debate.	5.426585856183021
It is therefore political by nature.	3.716226873156126
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	2.733325276084616
After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals?	2.5397220361024333
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	2.7492962311315554
Secondly, it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries.	2.4556862604082217
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	3.164889410589593
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	2.23232306520299
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	2.6395487636434973
In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement	2.998324941510115
We therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in Romania, reaching as far as Belgrade, but above all, the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues.	2.870033659232461
I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists.	5.114602494573846
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	2.554804763378356
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	2.9371632576713425
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	4.053314577596559
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done.	2.469336689309993
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment.	3.5222318165814115
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe, tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union' s regions.	3.6926075255746276
The time for action is upon us.	2.4840412147601527
The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income.	2.4450827799484602
In addition, this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital, which is one of the central tenets of the internal market.	3.5138560001697186
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	2.016475932665068
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era.	3.149417921730009
The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry.	4.594602059805956
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text.	4.004229977648198
We consider that, given the hydrological characteristics of Spain, where transfers of a structural nature are carried out, the authorities of the country should make decisions with regard to its own resources, and these decisions should, of course, always be taken in accordance with the quest for cohesion and the rational use of water.	3.1001761214915073
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog.	3.227006698337364
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	3.232092784543466
The plant is not yet there.	2.593485585753037
Finally, we should make it quite plain to Malta that if it wants to become a Member of this Community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements, for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up!	3.1397258276503273
That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money.	3.194069171248885
However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted.	3.528667634243158
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one' s own interests.	1.8808055321680368
It is a miracle that they were saved.	4.940476846181006
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February, but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content.	2.4984311287426983
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
The European consumer organisation, which has asked us to support the common position on this point, is to my mind letting the consumer down.	3.829027322416038
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.	2.6963797812396417
They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served	3.2890111174661865
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman.	3.8003059264436074
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth.	2.377305927432113
.	77.3301660757284
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.	2.7667470027702823
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position.	2.6485459215933886
That is why we want annual reports, we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure, to make sure action is actually taken.	3.0210764412763558
However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence.	3.2909459463537307
I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.	2.7440672730409457
Of course, the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet, but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing, these storms will, of course, hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century.	2.9234774934512675
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected.	2.964708336000141
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city.	1.9735142482001782
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level.	3.2717406241901155
We have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text, in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which the Member States failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to Article 2(7) into the draft resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.	3.0245761138735823
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself.	3.318857317075888
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that "the world looks up to Europe" ?	2.9444318943803296
There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.	3.1379584245559897
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	2.4083442880136046
Naturally, there are good, capable employees in the Commission, and they are in the majority. But we need radical reform.	4.388436943367819
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue.	3.0666046095601547
Apparently, the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so.	3.294489215155777
This is the philosophy behind the initiative; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies, non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible, so that it can get as close to the people as possible.	3.0358017993047874
The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland.	2.790277327553344
Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union.	2.8173002391269355
	32.62528478497609
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place.	2.03451576770493
He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity.	3.7193014377473292
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	3.546402386080405
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner.	4.330057988666638
Mr President, in relation to the Schroedter report, I am aware, and have had it confirmed to me by Mr Barnier, that the rules on additionality concerning Structural Funds apply only at the level of Member States and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside Member States in favour of self-governing regions such as Wales or Scotland.	3.7390572370075934
We must use dialogue at every political level, including of course dialogue with the national parliaments.	2.3235076833810586
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position.	3.3059490457543386
We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU.	2.4034365505609236
These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.	1.9815332603975797
Macedonia did not go through a war.	2.252820560280392
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.	1.689996799535177
We value our public service, our universal postal service, because we know, and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens, that the citizens value this service and the Commission undertook, during Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, to maintain this universal service throughout the European Union.	2.995731724794258
This is why I give this report my full support.	2.9601297461944456
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred.	2.881950110955348
In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance.	2.5746602515836554
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government.	2.411131978156594
First of all, civil society.	4.1478032728984635
Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist.	3.2910421516995587
The objective is of course to create, first and foremost, a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified.	2.9165272859756475
If we do not, we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.	3.2624693449217306
The possibility, if necessary, of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement, as there really is justification for it.	2.4709548188768666
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible.	2.639692876811464
However, I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper.	4.406875390231662
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	3.0873171335147345
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy?	2.5812184524995625
This was demonstrated by the Americans who, after the Exxon Valdez disaster, within one year, adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation, which threatens, as I said earlier, to divert ships unacceptable to American ports towards Europe.	2.0294553746363064
Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses.	2.4315704223221974
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	1.8055292269864625
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons.	3.3924005166252122
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty, insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency.	2.1972305036587687
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days.	3.486720257960427
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before.	2.596443579438948
But at the same time, one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended.	2.26611171209224
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us?	1.9798665922332899
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs.	3.355053597393387
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained.	2.8476478624124595
Lastly, in today' s vote on our four amendments, two have been approved and the other two rejected.	2.388312744789006
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council.	2.5860993718292216
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive.	3.9619839377579313
It is already employed widely in the transport sector.	2.4172417544645963
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	3.3869920119378705
I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers.	3.5092261674765
Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well.	4.119125126866445
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	2.3843886296412675
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	2.017254594933643
Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	1.8399460311887539
Are these reports accurate?	1.5579137543441066
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources. This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions.	2.688678559915999
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	2.588062206780892
Do we have the results of this impact study?	5.084966397359936
The German version is not very clear here.	2.388445131560195
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	2.869202103776591
Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities.	1.9683084501166153
We are familiar with Parliament' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council' s legal advisers.	3.6537906242143388
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example.	2.026489586766076
So what is the European Union doing about it?	5.7484338603282845
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows.	3.0849280578032903
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	2.3292979391079314
And the more consumers invest, the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets.	3.658958840187211
This is also expressed in Recital 14.	3.3159131371832378
Mr President, I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems.	2.693750797149298
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme.	3.4261765563526057
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led?	2.7412382999865557
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area.	2.53447496920533
Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful.	2.2382226262176244
Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health.	3.3940744296231187
As you know, the first steps were taken some months ago.	3.1801533043739862
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term.	2.494749784180317
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised, particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks.	3.441725613704634
They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested.	2.9244722368804608
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border.	2.393425637051923
We need organisation and statistical monitoring.	1.475304913291733
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof.	1.8721054418559944
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process?	1.8562467942527325
.	77.3301660757284
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account?	3.54920705291242
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.	2.708132542342828
I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved.	2.966502463951703
I believe that this will be difficult but, in any event, we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries.	5.206824846339715
By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine.	2.1595607177817717
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	2.656964577793296
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	2.5126113269260255
First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women.	3.4088753567414454
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia, Central America and the Caribbean.	1.525690237819644
I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.	3.5211962463914643
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern.	2.07749372277998
It is a highly complex problem.	6.004531570883722
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this.	2.011910990288288
One of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong, especially when it comes to revenue of the European Union, then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another.	3.5595589777949193
In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU.	2.4621199259123556
Can the Commission confirm that the Directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in Denmark as far as 'collective agreements ... declared universally applicable' (cf. Article 3(1)) are concerned, given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under Danish law?	2.6235004690609025
We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht.	3.890344615203051
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented.	2.216917390487179
This brings us to the two proposals for directives.	2.8130986955757677
.	77.3301660757284
Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle.	3.3673372799743038
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years.	2.158952812262354
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	2.302876445577122
This report is about the Commission.	5.7824952610967575
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	3.765838819222591
But, more importantly than that, cultural activities are what make mankind civilised.	2.0276203405367466
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners.	4.155316212783791
We must reach agreement here, in all the European Union' s ports, from Marseilles, through to Rotterdam, to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven, and wherever ships drop anchor.	2.770911443365572
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it.	2.385061676804765
The Member States have spent similar amounts.	5.054513770156457
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa.	2.5499180947421163
As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy.	2.2711382106773206
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth.	2.2009950243735004
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification.	3.314343168642825
I thought that it was quite superb.	3.062135185830259
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana.	2.11667645685602
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.	2.522754676994676
We would, in this way, violate democracy.	4.483593515638174
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe.	2.8213465596352925
It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall.	3.930567511972771
Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	3.9957385245421424
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22.	2.771623523202218
Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned.	2.8880631115442124
Thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights, principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation: I am thinking of fair trials, and more particularly of the rights of the defence, of the impartiality and integrity of judges, of the length of legal proceedings, for which my country, Italy, unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down, of the cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights.	2.763122799917255
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	2.294830185683346
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	2.8523269240784264
So the "Grappa War" is over.	4.592356820391997
I also want to mention the death penalty.	4.03782922386618
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992, its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union.	2.8486395289514803
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.	3.393871150349695
Relating to Amendment No 6	1.3661090577094717
The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.	2.0641607348022952
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts.	2.3927234964952095
I am optimistic that we shall succeed.	3.517180644051454
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	2.979866328795522
I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome.	2.817239006607979
We have made many promises in this regard, but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread.	3.1316483750282194
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	3.9016417613508354
Native Americans in the US - Dineh	3.0487464684816072
This is not the case!	8.327774171336625
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners.	2.1477730323672035
As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken.	4.474089353848645
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water.	2.8075553356515415
In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model.	2.7457172509608956
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks, if any, are limited to an area around the target.	2.042861902694348
Without them we would not be able to function.	5.257873505065018
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	3.6871789220920372
All over the world, Europe' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities.	3.3620588468484787
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects.	2.9585242787951067
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty.	2.5546006562874486
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions.	2.0481768288385296
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	2.4955868218611807
Yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies, both individuals and States. This reaction was more organised than previously, due in France particularly to the magnificent ATTAC network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular.	2.05246010352742
In the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - Parliament will have to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the Commission for 1997.	2.8408462928696228
There are now 28 channels here in this Parliament, including two Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but still no Dutch, and as many as seven English, six German and six French.	2.1017858235053355
Question No 30 by (H-0793/99):	1.2605856117352525
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	2.7155392520787376
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	3.544045565061994
This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised.	2.3584843443213845
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	3.1339624049011503
So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either.	1.9901340616303747
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	3.872148155279049
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	1.911376705122412
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	2.4795066737267857
A new independent audit system service must be set up.	2.1766480192912754
In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself.	2.9040329266639264
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen.	1.7566969553305816
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise.	3.5897896957086095
This is not desirable, either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment.	2.64898562156178
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as, as a result of this, the card' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States.	3.4117339287058774
Let us just consider for a moment.	1.61040803749969
The amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has, in our view, been overtaken by events because, following consultations with the representatives of the Member States in the STAR Committee, this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by Parliament.	2.6938456503702914
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.	2.97897969923603
The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact.	2.533819534982845
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	2.4646608642993306
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	3.8044470215439357
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	2.821763776794541
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee.	3.3285021980674285
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules!	2.5907452753068356
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed.	1.8842675553917425
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all, including the United States of America, which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans.	3.138064219131848
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action.	2.6416151753503483
As Mrs Terrón i Cusí said in her speech, 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, an expectation realised with the conclusions of the Tampere Council, and a fundamental expectation, as from this year, that will be realised in the form of specific actions.	2.6440990121050643
The ACP-EU agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption, by sparing those who are responsible: when will sanctions and controls be imposed on Total-Elf, which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the Congo?	2.7143571632062207
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act.	3.5541369155883293
The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted.	2.5404254148347944
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset, it should, in my view, demonstrate this in practice.	3.286434472265347
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs.	2.1993687984727064
This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order.	3.050499397425047
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.	1.954577999214235
First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	3.2597547408977015
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.	2.724050987754025
It is now February and we are still waiting.	5.13958900022679
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	3.2732791345801475
It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs.	2.569223481728098
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements.	2.8606567673282792
. (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out.	3.294128017801012
One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources.	1.6794477995530772
Anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming!	2.14560719829693
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular.	2.0644066809607815
.	77.3301660757284
In its resolution, this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious, far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission.	2.452443437978303
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically.	1.8091949604101993
Madam President, I asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as President of this House. We have a procedure for visits to be made to this House to report on certain situations.	3.5191169287594666
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.	2.6376463212955668
We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system.	2.428921461175418
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	2.9123504949728285
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	3.7353488550067677
First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection.	3.480165820882841
What I can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working, for as long as it is involved with this matter, in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards Members of the European Parliament. We will also make the utmost effort with members of the Council, particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year, so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution, and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this House.	3.212410487413139
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city.	2.437560861789256
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups.	1.8605135271161048
We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months.	2.987471013765444
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	1.4451350866906543
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.	2.228494413456627
Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.	3.7629324498195404
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme.	3.678129359703749
We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us.	3.5522108012912708
In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas.	3.7664340984248015
The next item is the joint debate on:	2.1554624779629346
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long.	2.712746218843158
The negative consequences are well known, the positive ones less so.	2.251334988048289
Mr President, firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject.	3.4348275168137405
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme.	2.687105878837058
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	2.222071661000769
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	2.9149699498802404
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry, particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002.	2.9468806791443147
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	3.922639188291198
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	2.297232803584329
Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present.	5.221346253481308
In the way it is structured, Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes.	2.0420935085274485
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.	2.4191106846126385
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	3.5455505375364096
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects.	2.929411919011104
The vessel is anchored outside the port, as the condition it is in is a safety hazard for the port and the surrounding areas, and because it cannot be inspected properly, as there is no one who will pay.	2.8435987920788
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	1.7983180181723435
I am pleased to see, however, that under LEADER+, new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development.	2.7579015079243976
Mr President, today' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe.	3.6957662737128807
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals.	2.411270497855083
What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect?	2.156572196185258
We shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the Commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the States which consider this service essential to the citizen.	2.985451082375275
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	2.860980876901595
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings.	2.0613358691051045
Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite).	3.2017236568144276
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted.	3.053746196845611
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them.	3.5803413308564003
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.	4.244064989845972
Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income.	4.630325426292002
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this.	2.48295175047228
There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high.	2.8279197800503284
Mr Swoboda' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level.	1.7240359894097796
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship.	1.4717051291898475
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if our neighbour' s roof is leaking, we can lend him pots and pans to collect the water, but it is, of course, more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof.	2.8077103307589097
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them.	2.3635601848293173
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have.	2.9264897526026883
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	3.70385910417746
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now.	2.3597984215617243
Moreover, the von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just voted on, supports it in so doing.	3.6094221097002457
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	2.7167226523238
This, I thought, is no longer permissible, certainly not at the moment.	3.1015740323717207
Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines.	3.1220167994560257
As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years.	2.931973739835611
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers.	2.242308753583374
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive.	2.343969536306899
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares.	1.9222652149697164
As we sit here, hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique.	2.21130335247764
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	2.740739556623991
The competition policy has, as far as these resources permitted, contributed to this event.	3.0706761646379603
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness, fairness, consistency and professionalism.	1.8110886755562123
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation' s introduction of the Plimsoll line, a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels.	2.1005752546330614
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	2.8906058150129623
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects.	1.7468056874027817
Mr President, Mrs Stenzel, ladies and gentlemen, before addressing the EQUAL report itself, I should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based.	3.594980900395228
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary.	2.2413251702730865
I could not conclude without mentioning Mr Van Hecke' s speech in particular, in which he referred to the human rights situation in Africa and to the role and priorities of the Portuguese Presidency, and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the European Union.	2.9177868541967102
There is another small step, which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia.	2.4588118657183773
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	3.212961313693302
I am sure that you will agree, Mr President, and experience has shown us, that the process of enlargement of the Union is not without its pitfalls for both parties and the Czech Republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria.	4.028340998775875
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee.	2.5750952111213503
With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, the application of tariffs, the Spanish Socialists have been arguing, in accordance with the principle that the polluter should pay, that the directive should propose policies on accessible prices for all levels of consumption.	2.981576222234466
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting.	1.376317494641867
How can we do this?	5.494813302223849
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.	3.630377464345413
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.9172233937623588
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term.	2.7151452442136628
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
They are very important in this case.	5.658089494523776
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	2.817434061786178
However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	3.0984213822147217
I believe that, in accordance with Article 69 (2), we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the Commission, and I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to decide in favour of referral back to committee.	3.966943308444213
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination.	2.822635157451643
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied.	2.136427814978581
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report.	2.6764681575604907
In a nutshell: there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available.	1.8129509642046724
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.8336609721352835
Moreover, it is all just words, because the Socialist governments, which are now in a majority in Europe, are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments.	3.5877526143891503
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme.	2.9399207032740704
For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores.	4.270969006757644
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	2.8420822164717476
As far as the Treaty is concerned, the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet.	3.9120451786431465
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said.	2.8967198221766806
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars.	2.1217470275676322
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation.	2.6392470414602256
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age.	1.974221513330258
Similarly, despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the Framework Agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-February deadline, I very much hope that the much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached.	2.337447777358456
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way.	2.189689856503767
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	2.057365181740337
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.20885043331848
This will determine the success of our work.	3.3571099345930917
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy.	1.6671889766497363
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me: If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.	2.6038641813447496
I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact.	2.8790783272252654
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again.	2.1475277641494763
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism.	2.27311802888501
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	2.65919817265791
This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world.	2.5233428817957213
The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women' s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women.	2.925503097703571
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term.	3.7399533946371104
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	2.7675329164788427
There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR.	3.4629910570847775
Question No 9 by (H-0044/00):	1.1672026996941478
The general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives.	1.9683051364041126
However, we must stick to the facts.	4.5822640617899575
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold.	2.748897955111777
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances.	2.3686859153249546
The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the "Amsterdam left-overs" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these.	2.7079496027940775
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.	2.1220947326884367
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields.	3.2273435883833166
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened.	2.7373660168944145
Nonetheless, the French delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the Commission and the federalist faction have diverted the INTERREG initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations.	2.9454221118468533
So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do.	3.232025467515921
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.	2.659940186870081
We need hard and fast rules.	1.5090127326633178
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card.	3.155270055335322
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky.	3.4954580646373477
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.	2.2947784668709783
I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union.	2.857935941793458
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is.	3.61852747874339
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe.	3.3349681452033866
We will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue.	2.844611788213792
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services.	2.6454031912600886
Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed.	3.318367485118132
I would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the European Parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close-to-zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone-deregulating substances by the year 2020.	2.6273418486893685
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women.	2.97640643138535
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer, as it has been in this case, but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime.	3.5516217751176216
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	2.6220813790301087
With reference to the IGC, as you know, under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC.	3.643208273788164
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16.	2.425897199428507
The next item is the report A5-0039/2000 by Mr Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland, with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806(CNS)).	2.271867052721465
Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned.	2.8343706123671732
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.	2.2499479301569814
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24	1.4096045526347334
I shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name FYROM, which as you must know, is the subject of a difference of opinion with Greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years, under the aegis of the Secretary General of the UN in the context of related Security Council resolutions, but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to Article 5 of the so-termed Intermediate Agreement of 1995.	2.6012728609081424
It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries.	1.9199419241570657
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly.	2.8963436573445183
I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars.	2.8314284380233135
Because, as well as the irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry, the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry, to the conservation of marine resources, and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover.	3.1099703251892667
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	2.87041186224325
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease.	3.5657809568542427
Why should we add to them?	2.8819779945260793
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us, after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings, finally to produce a joint resolution.	2.7937095197305153
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology.	3.170604347414119
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States.	2.053374316470214
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect.	3.256359891219315
As to the second comment: regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand B, I wish to inform you, to confirm, that I have asked the Commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects, particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage, in the list of schemes eligible under strand B and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one.	3.208401535335869
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm!	3.5776127253656727
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	3.197978311034838
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome.	2.8754444936621497
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months.	3.4176389587803464
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars.	2.5316295123744443
We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market.	3.183382336987832
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women.	2.5650995919872885
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	3.245560251452353
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext, I refer to article 2.7, which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts.	2.55213892941074
Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force.	2.7858325129183803
Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.	2.215810936500571
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas.	2.2863241214088963
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	3.1615422410820795
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts.	1.479219490479448
Therefore, while the Commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality, with employee rights, which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid, public social protection system, we harbour serious doubts as to its position.	2.617507412323599
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate.	3.3921053000175996
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States.	1.9995086694780644
Measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action; that is, the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment, that is the burden of proof.	2.679724657119694
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	2.6742284396835787
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.	3.8106597505861504
This is where we want to go.	6.397855917955886
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished.	2.1930863755008
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June.	2.3970858572992526
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	2.4895487086784347
Mr President, the Committee on Industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so.	3.3951285071359965
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	2.6098395627370614
How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute?	2.242373242477293
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included.	2.3005708686659307
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having read the Commission communication on the INTERREG III initiative, and pointing out that I took part in the vote on Mr Decourrière' s report within the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and, particularly in the context of INTERREG III B, with the Commission' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of landscapes run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector, a sector in which many associations, especially cynegetic, are already making enormous investments in my own country.	2.710460212482174
Mr President, as others have done, I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced.	4.476148717506724
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))	2.0100323766469312
We really have not progressed very far.	2.1782871669067108
By contrast, I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino, as has consistently been the case since his appointment. This leads me to another point.	2.4385384648569333
Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative.	2.8911806422219715
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car.	2.6737452876479333
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.	4.004870589499857
If a particular Member State was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country, then this particular Member State would be able to revoke this card, as it were, for the reasons cited in this directive, which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution.	2.572545819014758
At a hospice for AIDS patients, I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients.	1.8183280748182982
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000.	2.971212558816231
Today, in many Member States, that is not possible.	7.548762079975041
We must, however, admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory!	2.612985418033337
In brief, the European Union knows what to do in Macedonia: to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned Stability Pact in the Balkans.	2.2224154518939003
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone.	3.056162148991537
Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.	2.1360038126550545
In taking over the mandate, the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made.	3.115660967714383
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	3.4696711166900736
Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more.	3.5520566473368786
We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats.	1.9953700742826062
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
I should also like to address two other points. We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs.	2.4562551366033185
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	2.300403620537458
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues.	3.5145241963339577
I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields.	2.3234690555182764
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives, which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions, and to foster their harmonious development.	2.896881658939711
The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue.	3.4478758548807558
It is equally important to note that "prevention is better than cure" .	2.5135733146613353
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.	2.994051417082716
Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers.	3.7836624692564143
They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up.	2.007111438031362
Secondly, an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal.	2.0860187396821246
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government.	2.744736408962972
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	1.9781834503908402
I endorse this view.	2.2609578788754057
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	3.1902547043660396
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.	4.1926052991665825
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models.	2.214386184197
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity.	3.067967423256515
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has, in these two short months, organised the first Development Council, admittedly an informal one, whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations. Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered.	2.37230078210376
Will Syria fully accept Israel' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law?	1.7937545113217412
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality, that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law.	3.2496349092902186
That is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the European Works Council Directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive.	3.0725065308660673
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission.	3.793712230727306
(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez) We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya.	3.346889392605863
Does this mean more flexibility, insecurity and fixed-term contracts?	1.6595645609725278
Nowadays, certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is, of course, in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them.	3.1505074206577843
We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.	2.778890314326584
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	2.677879394155841
The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.	2.66393948702258
These will take place at a later date.	2.8940232613804926
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment.	2.2643805395332404
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery, a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament, led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives.	2.4803252551698938
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change.	2.805711556182175
At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly.	3.110633193476475
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof?	2.3590692661827823
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement.	2.8311266083173834
It also reminds us of the need for a new growth model, one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the Catholics who are involved in social problems, who see, in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public, the most natural instruments for building solidarity.	2.8253316126251766
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.	2.4198521307591037
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants. We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution.	2.5399639710742075
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be, in my view, a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability.	2.3286564583676386
These cases keep occurring.	1.3118440324401996
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?	2.6069103644275518
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2.0415286566359616
Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	2.994312077343178
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for?	3.1889410040571766
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro.	2.79145052202237
However, local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that 'partnership' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance.	1.833912260619026
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020.	2.66711086768663
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica.	1.9760954273824811
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group.	2.1803301549854592
The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	2.267781203401879
However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	3.4596935533112965
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal, political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round.	2.1116157256680923
What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps?	4.4487782226277846
They have healthy economies, high-level economic relations, and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union' s political will.	3.1243617314201733
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	3.7333172977036533
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.	2.966698120976454
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred.	2.4778457635249556
In the current situation, we should say to the Russians "If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia" .	2.812542192344982
I would like to single Mr Wieland out for special mention, for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report, contributing excellent and constructive ideas; and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur.	2.2610916307158164
Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.2882502190070357
There have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the Group of the European People' s Party, and we have voted in favour of the Terrón i Cusí resolution, which we consider on the whole to be excellent.	3.350170635985506
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	4.1653646361905245
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG.	2.6221206051616477
I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving.	2.5478838480439485
Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code.	3.6131887102906215
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind.	2.165738390886083
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	2.5340273461193346
And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility.	3.140327158847319
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism?	3.1957635343169835
Because LEADER is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach, a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through LEADER I and II which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were.	2.5223994469389317
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and, if it is, I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process.	4.117426291405333
In this respect, one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model, the structurally planned cooperation between government, trade unions and employers' organisations.	2.4251126076066933
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	3.046658527114882
Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday.	2.6702184359287497
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation.	1.7527866224275195
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	1.9793753251767556
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	3.1938064836100826
However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.	2.1082452368618174
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least, therefore, to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy. Otherwise, the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing.	3.448169887045916
Unfortunately, the 25% often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements: in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily.	3.1835586924751516
Hence his disappearance of over one month.	1.5511394567809476
Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to good use.	3.847636603558805
I have a related point.	3.518323907468298
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing.	2.7175179046197866
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road.	2.5084674320853426
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time.	2.346499106812711
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world.	2.650264475870856
I believe that in this context, and in the context of the dialogue that the Council and Parliament will have to establish on the future of Europol and Eurojust, it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the Council and Parliament with regard to Europol.	4.4714495098187275
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	3.0282623070189034
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States.	1.8105508269736974
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society.	2.8404994347463597
In my opinion, this directive is unacceptable for this reason.	5.158758318954562
There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again.	2.6892641475729264
So much for the political aspect.	3.039108059442319
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1).	2.0788264110172467
As regards the other aspect of Agenda, the aspect of cohesion and regional development, there we do indeed have great achievements to point to, but there are still less developed regions, particularly island regions, to which more attention should be paid.	2.6322001038877385
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators.	1.860623162652252
I can only warn you against consenting to this.	2.9013482639163852
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems, for example, disabled people' s access to the workplace.	2.3365721665993022
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten.	4.707181672065965
Firstly, the enlargement of the thematic areas.	3.841814307633842
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.	4.8787926034156035
The danger is too great for us to ignore.	2.581391596191055
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project.	2.5864240006467116
Employment is growing at a good rate.	1.6738178239473969
Since then, however, there has been no progress.	6.022604710764377
The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform.	2.671997819122182
We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics.	2.7206850842385006
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force.	2.620692155699029
I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed.	2.4611505154859836
Even in that respect, any cooperation should, however, be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle.	3.6062342803411522
As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report.	2.3198179046493
The detailed rules would then follow in that framework proposal.	1.5818448826567795
Our internal borders, or what remains of them, no longer cause wars, but they do continue to generate economic backwardness, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe.	2.4595783689645057
As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems.	3.110470367654528
As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies.	2.8938573592145835
EQUAL stands for "equality" .	1.5269644687058206
This is all I can say today.	3.667682396871698
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries.	1.9544259058789661
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring.	2.313500817171378
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all.	2.5509612526314247
It is still not an insurmountable problem.	2.806113853854434
Not necessary!	449.0601111516776
The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105.	2.565888228911716
During the first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new 'pre-accession' heading (B7-0), proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft budget, should not be limited to the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe and should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.	3.67441408246462
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur.	2.7817201042838273
In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then.	2.17129862004019
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	4.511764640561503
Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halïnen.	3.026590552675958
If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed.	3.735584684104419
I have decided, in the end, that the most remote regions, to which I attach particular importance, will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of INTERREG, with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other Member State regions.	3.167358290788583
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	3.065619081054952
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	2.5165197327774105
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.	2.752359511403187
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	3.3949793636348216
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters.	2.148311019943494
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past.	3.0828949563173844
Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.	3.9141807599737497
The war in Chechnya, like any war, is a trail of horrors.	2.729664992437922
The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base.	3.311702878365964
What is more, the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital, it is not European, but world-wide.	2.613723489796138
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently, we can help significantly to restore confidence.	2.7501897102800306
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996, following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind.	2.234132252436787
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis, we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services.	3.540657577349398
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory?	2.1230001596467787
Madam President, I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan.	3.1201504305209204
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover, and unfortunately we can go no further on those.	2.0056815277291
So, yes, appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines, to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds, and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet.	2.2045440860847276
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	3.2523681412089624
I certainly appreciate that.	2.0971441971004787
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points. First, genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs.	2.138074758413839
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	1.7036815271832992
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system.	3.0135381449986136
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases, specifically restricted to organised crime, terrorism and drug trafficking.	1.7627369237582409
Have we achieved results?	1.4560203452058078
For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report.	2.4475187581047386
For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments.	3.4929665960062706
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	3.7119106895363694
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now.	4.057401285551502
We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail.	3.4522768216258557
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water.	2.2412642211624503
The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one.	3.54725245734789
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made, and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House.	2.8894335104581015
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.	3.0291353315187304
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen.	3.371162643813828
Everyone now knows of the scandal of the export refund scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on West African markets, slashing prices for local cattle farmers by half.	1.5874802224558735
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria.	3.1467069255303652
However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued.	2.595467898060693
We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider' s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures.	2.567177199765808
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	3.901173236348664
In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba.	2.267157503543574
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development.	3.119817817753329
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union.	3.274664296724784
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	2.663484169391563
Question No 36 by (H-0025/00):	1.1672026996941478
One of the very first speakers, Mr Wuori, spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel.	3.5868256193222607
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme.	2.698759123340326
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	3.2483704093514554
The aim of these regional policies, which, of course, are implemented under the jointly agreed European guidelines in each Member State, i.e. each Member State is responsible for implementing this programme, is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women.	3.0580578578073054
In addition, car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use.	2.23667889744231
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	2.4655449732223893
I very much agree with you on that, but we can take nothing for granted.	3.5526554519869666
How, furthermore, can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe.	1.8851168319165774
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms, privatisation, de-regulation proposals, as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which, as we know, constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit.	2.6502655343923722
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs.	2.839416243038851
We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired.	2.0909646127039405
There is a blatant discrepancy here!	5.366298998317874
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business.	2.255423185471617
But what will those limits be?	1.8001922400459829
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see.	4.675139663771089
Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference.	4.24311101311634
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes.	1.9827988382702786
It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy.	2.3691372488742353
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions, which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly.	3.42013036179557
In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people.	2.5349896743423677
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at, especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries.	2.688266510278864
You say there will be no further funding.	2.8043933250504964
Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament.	4.0133170500554165
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned, and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague.	3.918154009730276
In February, Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued.	1.8315182025638965
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	2.5379818206033398
This question has now entered a different dimension, a dimension in which USD 1 500 billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments, no more than 3% of which have anything to do with the real economy.	2.1590385372303413
However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit.	2.585770372970094
I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid.	3.4534122464493757
We can submit motions for this together with you.	1.5975092007420546
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	3.6322601292232446
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying 'What in your view is the ideal community police officer' and the reply was 'a black grandmother' .	1.8422686105972816
The next item is questions to the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice (Article 39 of the TEU).	2.899437821219186
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	3.007589062884663
However, because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control, and audit under the present terms, it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role, no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it.	2.60817533492566
I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	2.048698648880024
She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China.	2.4603301044784156
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends.	2.561324145343499
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	2.760356511868901
Currently, both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.	2.043649125619722
We are to get the documents that are sent to them.	3.0858135587081494
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country' s statutes to another' s.	2.07235097214381
I appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4, to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.730240981634286
I understand that Portugal is affected by this.	2.862971855734151
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity.	3.5515999057325884
Obviously, the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy.	2.9264538319032445
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000)	1.0386257998215709
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks.	2.2811590903498913
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support.	2.309355611746355
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	2.9381211998488346
I do not want to link this question with your comments about the period "before" and "after" NATO' s intervention, as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this Question Time.	2.619993722311634
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast.	1.6199046493801046
This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region.	2.7474220549368744
Mr President, Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance.	3.2845631956514607
In other words, a product' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous.	2.478776786294167
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	3.47898269319216
The main risk is that the Commission, without adequate justification, might upset the balance which exists now by proposing to go swiftly on to a second phase of liberalisation which would, in some countries, throw off balance the funding of the universal postal service, making it unmanageable.	2.6070581809047644
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects.	3.014761078980195
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.	3.1901957368686484
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	2.457427076224822
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when, on the continent of Europe itself, the right to life is at risk?	2.882232791546708
In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail.	3.785889289693056
As I said earlier, our ambition is total security for money and value for money.	1.9450718130549598
As the French say, "ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees.	3.7675199753016564
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	2.4724288155600314
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource.	2.903227995754388
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	1.414226651761118
The second proposal, on which the report is excellent, does not require any particular comment.	3.3516229946287193
The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC.	3.2333553139347617
There should be no confusion in this debate. As environmentalists, we do not want an excuse for a motion.	2.8550312847236716
And I should point out that, for the first time in history, a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago.	2.9008642008039662
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations.	2.478689470972313
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace.	3.01633290175719
On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States.	2.4301277615538934
And yet President Prodi himself gave firm guidance to the Italian Government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro, and he is aware of the major role played by Italy in European development.	2.8563751538432567
That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.	3.2445612457521165
Third point: specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women, but also immigrants and refugees, must be envisaged.	2.7297753341152844
It is high time that we reached an agreement.	2.1583367365616515
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	1.7756262680664274
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, during the Asian crisis in 1997, as with those which hit Mexico in 1995 or the EMS in 1993, everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation, particularly currency speculation.	2.6350734988054336
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully, and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result.	3.063378338361099
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.3291812913815297
Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want.	2.1056729557916674
It will not be a philosophical Paper, but a practical Paper, full of focused proposals.	2.910643601879502
As Mr Patten said, and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended, the crucial point is China.	2.639102432464197
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice.	2.046501417704056
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase.	2.483674792330735
The staffing system is too rigid.	1.5853639487485418
Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards.	2.873246010113881
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate.	2.201243131308242
I would like to mention one final point.	4.356877672731458
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged.	3.090986084133008
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	2.6813912050468645
But NATO' s decision for military intervention and the KLA' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony, as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia.	3.0236906077683723
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance.	2.4930672627298396
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	2.961390853654048
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources	1.7426389203826491
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.	3.049233571699226
Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars.	3.217321763677542
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	2.1377654858886257
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector.	2.3935977441853713
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	2.3663768146746076
In that case, the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity.	2.861173951953865
This is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy, the European Parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, particularly with regard to respect for OSPAR. This convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action.	3.175250269654942
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds. Instead, the focus should be upon preventing the real problem.	2.8081653375968134
It is hard to understand why the French and the Europeans allow something which the Americans refuse to accept, and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety.	2.1115413900921904
We would like to know their names and their faces.	2.896694169159899
This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend.	3.8056051390245944
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	2.9470642288399667
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget.	2.6512712302924073
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions.	2.542807442608055
In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	3.0143777912803715
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue.	2.3686459461043445
By Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, by the spring, still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was, in fact, in place.	2.5392659746925954
And a woman was elected.	1.4949061407662003
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States.	1.9875903740429655
Madam President, my apologies, I was looking at Amendment No 36, which logically precedes Amendment No 37.	2.6694075775420627
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	3.0913731463994094
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place. It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled 'sustainable urban policy' .	2.2432147706054577
(The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.53137621712082
Do you think that, when we legislate about chemicals, we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future?	4.126610950317529
Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management.	2.5516956433910134
As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase.	3.0639908130676643
I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	3.5372201814428155
We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management.	3.7630118277297435
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management.	2.2561207027676082
And this dialogue is open-ended; it adapts to the demands of the day.	3.6044963611934744
The WWF reports that, according to Italian, French and Spanish customs authorities, illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase.	1.8294719310559313
This gives rise to serious malfunctions, because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes, whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done.	2.068076867819168
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	2.900678840722991
I also feel there are grounds for ensuring, in particular, that the financial channels of States or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some LAGs to become bankrupt under LEADER II.	2.345107093751232
Coherence of EU policies with development	1.3648539271527533
Subject: Gender and environment Practically all the contributors involved in the Rio and Kyoto processes - individual organisations, civic action groups, governments, the World Bank, the UN and relief organisations - believed that women should take a greater part in decision-making on the environment.	2.097265724167865
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.	2.1640777756320335
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade.	3.2799353005454726
In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas.	2.6537255511128057
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.4137555711461705
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this.	2.2212865676443805
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process.	3.4889511741255803
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	3.967418679905373
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application.	3.046552543297461
Mr President, Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention.	5.034596833456702
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples.	3.2804039277091745
It makes it impossible for those same Member States, at the IGC, to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights.	3.259242448690169
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors.	2.93487705302375
There are no boundaries for Community policies.	2.663445924409761
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue.	2.882395594506203
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	3.22019971904365
You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations.	5.018375570142829
There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another.	4.388561361395382
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach.	2.117911291882843
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party.	2.5573979948514456
What are we to do now?	2.1601208240650878
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival.	2.5074297009185145
This spurs us to maintain that the European Parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded, if this were a lawmaking parliament and if we were, as part of this procedure, in fact co-legislators - which we are not.	3.5209670118659653
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality.	2.7255014256635506
The need for transparency is rightly stressed, not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does.	3.5379701819192397
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs, the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola.	2.7774148734802044
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive.	4.061283815075377
That is certainly the view of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today.	2.734045896146318
Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned.	3.9410525119483077
The process of reform has been going on for some time, and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission.	2.8776435716905358
Madam President, I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning.	3.3716923146967845
Mr President, there is a mystery.	10.602046569739592
We therefore all agree on the established facts, and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction.	2.8936536600168665
Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.454902663714543
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress.	4.0217850974278395
Women have different individual needs and interests.	1.5550601386690783
The discretional power of the State, which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10, seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report.	2.4996307853199897
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.	3.0589755449243996
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	3.0791016467937338
Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status.	3.128320533046273
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	2.6609237500133602
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability, as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us, is the result of speculation.	2.8372552329579492
So much for the first comment.	5.8064572433023125
The last question concerns the amount granted.	2.387466072347252
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	2.2140971887990215
Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe.	3.3255521069416463
We will try to address them, but it is not easy.	3.977281054585627
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community.	2.8894293262692146
The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences.	3.871155443032609
Therefore, subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting, I can confirm what you have just said, that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort.	2.498045784969927
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years.	2.0755130172744956
Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you.	5.0185028373771825
The common position, which was arrived at with great difficulty in the Council, which the Commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in Parliament' s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, complies fully with the environmental requirements. I therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability.	2.5803507910846557
This precedent, created on the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency, is a worrying one as far as the future of the European Union is concerned.	3.793520559388534
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future.	3.838613700997108
All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile.	2.7827247994378346
Commission's strategic objectives and legislative programme	1.6698932367231978
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties.	2.9986088852615067
First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction?	3.9678355234636244
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen.	3.1137038361578333
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle.	2.1783192325477296
Mr President, the oil tanker Erika, the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on Malta and probably in Italy and Greece and which was hired by Total-Fina for the transport of oil, foundered off the Breton coastline, with disastrous consequences.	2.676547741479528
No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances.	2.374462057540142
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo.	2.9715194495703825
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can.	2.94696721430422
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	2.904997054913952
The common position is not ambitious enough.	4.233087410871197
What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States.	3.471155744782628
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo.	2.1399529815476948
And this is not pure chance.	7.0899918186843776
For competition is not an end in itself; it is there to serve of the citizen, the consumer, which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it.	3.635120294324791
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country.	2.7523822724960754
The human rights policy is also too selective.	3.4845215398085094
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament.	3.6814265133049338
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	2.684812752570833
However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months.	2.6231445706188374
That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment.	3.923349194725641
For the reasons set out above, I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax.	2.4106935474076114
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission?	2.9876472610877443
Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members.	3.3961102587595273
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged.	2.914318762579381
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria.	5.366917851721816
Mr President, what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as 'terrorists' and 'bandits' ?	3.136066550534752
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	2.730340568884435
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe' s ambitions in the area of CFSP.	3.0742707868505885
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail.	3.533715916804371
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	3.3208332878958022
In the area of environment, we are looking at ways to cooperate with Mrs Wallström; in the area of regional policy Mr Barnier is giving a lot of attention to this sector.	3.4420903981078457
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time.	3.3499393255599257
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	2.1835639941017613
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with.	2.06009197747472
As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.126954826771274
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	4.130773193778368
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience.	1.832647833113539
The Council's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas.	3.7551854023408167
In my grandparents' time, it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville.	2.146463753078474
The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements.	1.6026321646168618
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law, which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see.	3.313407768204121
McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000)	1.0820706359717611
In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state.	3.6705558184216347
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment.	3.0942539838905287
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter.	3.6918588812592312
Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, "The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally."	1.6883174648056831
The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives.	3.212405263938965
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements.	1.73031373163487
The former President, Mr Gligorov, can take special credit for this, and the current President too has already adopted the profile of President of all Macedonian citizens, so much so that the European Union should only be grateful to have him as interlocutor in the Balkans.	3.1630347180458553
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents.	1.7720000074773277
If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused.	2.3776422364583616
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	2.956448032614498
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	2.8507068171815058
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament.	3.4994917679909405
But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union.	3.091638348909221
(The sitting was suspended at 1.23 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.5387170647848523
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment.	3.8788348843758738
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides.	2.0688597377906817
.	77.3301660757284
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East.	2.8502564100573844
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries, which accounts for 69% of the total work force there compared with 1.7% in the EU.	2.6291373714052035
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year.	1.7684069117127414
I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them.	2.4218626000796672
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.	3.6219955174714777
So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation.	3.5822383783139133
Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world?	3.1602545981023153
I hope that Parliament's participation in the Geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence. First and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects I have just mentioned as central to the identity of the European Union and of the European nation, and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place.	2.9908077700700546
That wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment, food safety, foreign trade, the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them.	2.9253614690503387
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.	2.2072944172868647
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all.	2.6619130867678993
In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable.	2.716846168503012
A proposal can be made, a proposal should be made, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, by the middle of this year.	3.9695623277443715
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy.	2.838477229589329
It will be there for some time to come.	5.300923614479811
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.	2.53345321433501
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there.	3.465411772239798
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	4.103747593843252
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies.	3.2861458745790797
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked.	2.4008757222088106
According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations.	3.948128709760286
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	2.3653645704740827
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree.	4.012284390464416
. Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte and congratulate him on the report.	3.0430093434970464
We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	2.6539028748827502
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	3.1219235201986346
If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.	3.41239665093974
Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire.	2.0491177407915333
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide.	1.4516302912212835
My country' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...	3.274473181028419
However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators.	2.0370954663857384
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	2.875383066927219
I would like to thank the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Decourrière, for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments.	2.7243239466242897
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.531277521076661
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident.	1.5449441754216804
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises.	2.092447422689243
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict.	3.056165357463239
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative.	4.016597317718425
. (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III.	3.038812243020909
Creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation, action to combat poverty, measures to assist low-income groups and old people, facilities for children, racial and ethnic integration, better opportunities for participation, a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures.	2.116814588735609
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy.	2.4818781061833577
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.	3.497409821976511
However, in this case, the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens.	5.000946879811687
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used.	2.7720015326237823
For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men.	2.507037760993779
Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent.	2.061747528900757
Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union.	3.5865323686107344
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned.	3.3132767731364625
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT. This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament' s role.	2.916240868604768
You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process.	2.597610761973321
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals, as well as of other dangerous substances and materials.	2.4040052243506085
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy.	2.75739064363856
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	4.198102365981742
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House.	3.2675037055612313
The Commission proposal is, as some of you have said, rather technical.	4.223063224924109
If you are persuasive in your actions, we all reap the benefits.	2.4580171504750856
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee.	2.1684073176473766
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	4.729720010655738
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies.	2.5109942961692853
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction.	2.3469808841401845
We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies.	2.5519478975364747
Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position.	2.3024335681865398
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive, which does not include any provisions of that kind.	3.7371602040164
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	2.4918812561000796
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy.	3.1213001915352936
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	2.531790993442964
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed.	3.827743738477774
May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	2.033600898607642
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated.	3.801636858554656
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	2.727069841278507
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement, and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities.	2.8679818183485404
Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.	2.801521629983924
One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion.	1.9351441192185062
On the contrary, I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM' s relations with all its neighbours.	2.5312490789999753
Moreover, we are asking the Russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so-called detention centres, and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention, maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity.	1.937137381934266
Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	2.841737260561608
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union, what consequences would that have for free competition?	2.689555546333142
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	3.406080558178595
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level. This gives the citizen a sense of recognition, here in Europe and elsewhere.	2.43904830620285
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study. It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe.	2.08978394350517
Again, that will be a very demanding challenge.	4.633381848217555
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration.	1.604051575399895
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	3.2504047106802294
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	2.851463029263199
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	3.866582858121085
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy, and especially in the agricultural sector.	3.264305111027883
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights.	2.5614800359585117
The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states.	3.3805411996298167
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	4.672529058988101
In particular, the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby Parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure, deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure, oversteps the implementing powers delegated to the Commission.	2.3914055289459655
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because, in their view, it might break up European policy on competition, which is to say, in plain terms, attacking the standardising superstate.	2.9664598966749
The aim at national and European level is to establish large action groups by tender, with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested. We would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised.	2.4663475074660037
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential.	2.7240984615390564
All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them.	2.374627213391271
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality.	2.867970567204628
We in the European Union are one Community.	5.319199679264499
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns.	1.8823939050858605
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	2.141394125331445
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	2.420132473912496
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi.	4.912487239807692
The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere;	2.876193347566171
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility.	3.3891098331149085
Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, with the LEADER report, rural development is very much to the fore.	3.8265415661406816
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	4.151273483707675
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to.	2.5422353232231174
If the current draft is correct, then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today.	2.925663316306941
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	3.56260204792161
So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10.	3.5482782651126903
This is not covered by the directive.	6.573824948995865
I welcome you and your ambition.	2.075723679052947
The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process.	2.9230835924869836
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future.	2.374599503529158
I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni.	2.9924475146771132
Madam President, today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles.	5.31074786752737
Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types.	4.126495348871393
If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light!	2.686436321030509
Between 1994 and 1999, our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006.	1.9711618762905818
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	2.5213802545841255
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency, but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step, and that is not only my assessment, but also that of the European Ombudsman.	3.2344646484508752
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, the recent peace talks begun in the USA between Israel and Syria mark a turning point in the history of the Middle East. It has taken fifty years to reach this point, which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations.	2.8099514326953323
But then again, the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment.	2.673152270223874
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.	2.8979787976705413
- (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic.	2.8423722683557635
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe.	1.9478632085428107
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo.	2.7990228477525356
The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.	2.011082540165755
Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.	3.028503703858492
Finally, the Commission's human resource policy must be modernised.	4.314220899001698
Firstly, the governments made a commitment at the Maastricht Conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the Treaties. This commitment was not fulfilled in the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding.	2.909563030323978
In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen.	3.39271269702637
What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast?	2.285171078919118
But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.	2.2287482483994183
I am sure that it will serve, amongst other things, to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups.	2.743362659245932
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+.	3.7888243125695205
This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is more a case of a competition between suppliers.	4.359370857374763
If a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion, if a request is made at all, then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult, unless one simply admits that there is no cohesion at all.	2.7377497278405434
Basically, the more we lose our grip on morals, the more we tighten our grip on our wallet.	2.4036483139534437
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.	2.1027708190270733
I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report.	3.0343216735333955
It has already been mentioned that the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force in May and this Parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this Treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.7028563841494146
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes.	2.962104468068227
At the moment, in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation, which is agreed within the framework of the Universal Postal Union, allowing for lower tariffs.	3.065377528472185
The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006.	3.247927062352638
All of this needs to happen, and quickly too.	2.8921071482171428
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent.	2.3033033377602057
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	2.9033911598630473
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration.	2.1504251949689626
LEADER+ differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible. It is also more ambitious, and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet.	2.9346234422255892
Just now, Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed.	2.821630624339528
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	2.671068237732611
First part	72.17482167067989
However, Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans.	2.133123955857589
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date.	2.7921870029488165
The truth, of course, is that a great many Member States, and no doubt other nations too, have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle, even if it has not always been called that.	3.346512334674722
Secondly: a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark.	2.47095541307675
You can be satisfied with the progress made.	3.4044781270678053
The Council is minded to give priority to this area, within the Transport Council, and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible.	4.105586211966096
Finally, the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities.	3.832059174301798
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised.	1.708836439706544
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
Many thanks for this.	1.7933978101770798
Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force.	3.0162331453782967
Like a number of previous speakers, I, too, wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects, which, in my view, should be incorporated into the pubic domain.	3.7238765038061206
For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria' s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!	2.1617203362898256
There must be flexibility.	6.4536373879595805
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes, and if this is impossible, to apply them in closed systems.	2.873420227017485
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it.	2.1635695964145567
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems, just as it does in the foodstuffs industry.	2.4372007944203204
Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too.	2.230206589800075
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	2.285948775010538
As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money.	2.3208690680631046
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself.	3.0782260294554846
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented.	3.0925839038258975
I will set this out in five points.	1.7668323267403572
Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety.	2.816614281533947
This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent.	2.3324545935950445
Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced.	4.015330302041685
However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union.	2.5502063261815384
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	3.865793614237927
As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service.	3.0297773007062854
	32.62528478497609
I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	2.215006000869655
There are men and women who depend on fishing, gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas. They are environmentally sensitive areas, but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium.	2.2115721270445903
What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability?	2.5772893798499763
Consequently, we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger, i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs.	2.8364948464606785
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects.	2.974427134400632
Middle East peace process (continuation)	1.978158100916214
However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here.	3.112219156568237
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission' s 5 year Strategic Programme	4.359287224486465
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved.	2.47868174121153
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement.	2.539338530839395
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin, antibiotic, sludge and other scandals have attracted.	2.383839969797037
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive.	3.3783038600639173
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent, provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically, so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained.	2.424947205321345
That is not guaranteed.	7.416258413196083
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice.	3.2567361996882984
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	3.0406569150892384
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support, and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response.	4.063807115097562
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function, the coordination of scientific information in the EU, and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States.	2.125761754909138
As far as your question is concerned, this problem does not only apply to Denmark. It is not only Denmark which has matters pending.	3.399926202920781
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness, because the money should not be squandered recklessly.	3.124743114642277
It has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible.	3.167135637461098
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.	1.8246301686805197
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting.	2.5986149793037483
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives.	2.453523510294288
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.3015353384432573
I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way.	4.116942185530954
It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session.	2.9226060308071715
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	3.229243508768676
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work.	3.0214649423902165
The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform.	2.2599911547227096
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales.	2.9044164819329397
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done.	2.8059116790862464
Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics.	3.4301778560859884
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it.	2.519804457566581
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	3.017128053506247
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations.	2.778031583090385
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers.	2.744493490036778
For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters.	2.74740193632009
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change?	2.47227342593559
I have, in fact, always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation, in which one-third of this republic' s territory is occupied by Turkey, before starting negotiations with Cyprus was quite unfair.	2.6799112647323016
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures.	2.735952169070139
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose.	3.2635568993513386
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand.	2.433024491730821
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required.	3.6279003705667203
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session.	2.525892200034724
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us.	3.12903477345339
Let us make this clear, however much some people may not wish to believe it.	2.431684883378091
I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this!	2.133635672911219
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	1.6084622894824032
In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency.	2.3096394480375753
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation.	3.8755876093401174
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
There is a risk, however, that all the effort that has been made in recent years, after all the problems with the peace agreements, with which we are all familiar, will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks.	3.831718351751807
Today, we are witnessing one of these cases, which, on the surface, may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry, but which, if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule which will cause problems for many of the Member States and the Union as a whole.	3.4470448360890598
But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency.	3.9468911633901644
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	1.793469300752727
And no one can comprehend this attitude.	2.2124556089554317
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	4.081561313413346
However, I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested.	5.039808315669262
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.	2.884621739448707
We ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social operators, including unions and non-governmental organisations.	2.0190927578056574
In our Group, we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996.	2.410166725458841
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	3.5461358804996856
According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value.	2.3111832652571027
Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	3.713625883113357
Question No 41 by (H-0813/99):	1.2605856117352525
In view of this situation, renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by James Tobin, winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, to create a tax on currency transactions. The rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments, but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation, thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions.	2.6736386658431255
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.	2.525435650768876
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	1.5452333855658713
I understand that there is agreement on this issue.	4.617739047162318
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	3.4786357444760916
Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper.	4.331417125068874
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick.	2.816856103688856
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.	2.8146249384984228
Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises.	1.6740904774635472
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages, but have not been able to check all of these, and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type.	3.44543622059097
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy, Germany and England, is reviewing its production and relocation, justifiably, in its own view.	1.8565154207463892
One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions.	3.4532312795560767
Has it been discussed?	1.6373422238825694
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	3.0271637015111525
Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.	2.4697469517927693
. (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.	3.807056204040022
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres.	3.0805018044243146
You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better.	3.5060761357311336
The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council quickly finalise this important dossier which constitutes, in our view, the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today.	2.7162801201632933
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	2.775744703201754
I should like to make just a few comments.	5.2481410818846355
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate.	2.7495978271669586
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	2.830860158907991
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	3.0495062804509203
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation.	2.6280987949046226
As an integral part of a value-added structure, the White Paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication: to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk; to be highly visible; to tell the good news story about food; to be proactive.	2.5416003062911146
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption.	2.7708414974648257
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much.	2.3585404401179275
The vote will take place at 12 noon.	2.1954257882455224
Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice.	1.7749049443702447
They have our full support.	1.8802347587813582
In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property.	2.438344976715085
Therefore, particularly out of respect for you, I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this.	3.2615965274030443
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved?	3.58076219894541
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	5.644701827254962
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves.	3.120464560177927
While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there.	2.687300295397222
The following objectives were set: improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas.	1.9100605071287038
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	4.708131086715199
The most remarkable thing, in my view, is the message conveyed by this proposal: that the Commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily, and virtually automatically, requires reform of the centralised system.	2.8387331561538285
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	3.8427305890059595
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product, the subject matter of the application.	2.7303238379806696
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	3.680041387379385
. (DA) The European project began as a partnership between States.	2.410029047180594
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime.	2.57415756337443
Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report.	3.5730349467629177
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.	3.2498435691915017
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering.	2.936222254969396
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens.	3.3317892526481088
We have to offer solutions which, while provisional, help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice.	2.729555588015938
If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it.	2.6731142892261266
Finally, if the Commission and the relevant Councils of Ministers permit, I should like to stress that the Members of the European Parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the INTERREG projects and, beyond that, of similar initiatives.	3.822958196126682
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must, in turn, release its political prisoners.	2.074772652851093
And I would also say this to you, Commissioner: please, deliver the beef even if it is British.	3.738303164630282
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.	3.0460584983861634
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together.	2.2187098562221963
That is the real difficulty which we must overcome.	4.706222463216466
They have very little of it.	1.687527795137133
Up the point at which meat, milk, bread and other products are sold over the shop counter, feedingstuffs and additives are structured, mixed, blended, cut and transported several times.	1.7479257223030775
What is more, if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue, this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas, for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment.	3.27747150832811
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission' s list: mercury and tributyl, abbreviated to TBT.	4.000709517890379
We belong together, even when there are problems.	2.7236761099558082
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears.	4.603951939710855
A genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the ESF and employment strategy. The fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme period implies that the Member States really do need "guidelines".	2.973690431064306
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it.	2.7579354563936347
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal.	2.1395968547344832
I shall also mention the German Socialist Party which dares to preach to us about the second world war, when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were National Socialists, still goose-stepping, the party of the Waffen SS...	2.513894042146982
This regulation is purely instrumental.	2.296459211267928
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	3.1830568180304244
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach.	2.577406811461832
I consider this to be unacceptable.	2.805440438470348
Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme.	2.7039467212553605
However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government.	3.5105299562405263
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention.	2.155820529316171
That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries.	3.00220035016105
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	2.27117649996771
Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents.	2.789950206850045
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda.	3.08239989267557
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia.	2.1727995239893727
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem, problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator.	2.9945071291856102
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe.	3.884098296832823
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster, I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds.	3.6507616968663563
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	3.9230724155503367
What are the conditions for this recognition?	4.374580478560582
The situation is badly managed.	2.913403629357043
I can also assure Parliament that I will ensure that the pertinent provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of Directive 70/524 that the Commission has proposed in the White Paper on food safety to present to Parliament before July 2001.	3.2740826997725363
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted.	2.702299472335424
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	3.279305548444241
Mr President, Commissioner, the Balkans are not purely a dark cave, politically speaking.	3.001917046952159
How strongly is the single market established at the moment?	3.6960902831974125
I say they have a right to solidarity.	2.7224845314672472
- (ES) Mr President, I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party which I represent on this issue.	2.7915663208430908
For many years, I have tried, through the Council and the Commission, to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in, and working for, conflict resolution in the Western Sahara, which is occupied by Morocco.	3.7133301326555332
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	4.338344373822756
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists.	2.0744197554041834
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans, then we must have a level playing field.	2.5933320846621375
The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action.	2.306163299184108
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this.	2.9689216617852106
The question is: who prosecutes?	3.4303057423462895
I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it.	3.6851060565654854
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe?	2.6880937929510473
Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP.	2.02309526389146
This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation.	2.924078483606047
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource.	2.5831357001584667
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited.	1.6421442979958747
In this it said that in a few years' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances.	2.5174539518478616
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	3.4225313030073226
On 24 December, the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper, Expresso, to a year' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000.	2.563851831540544
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that.	2.3644641344868527
Turning to the specific questions that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has put to us, I shall group them into three basic areas: the fight against organised crime, the operation of the Judicial Network, particularly as regards criminal matters, and questions on Europol.	2.5880478780809635
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation.	2.940948983986137
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green.	2.7105622884482026
Then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the Commission as well.	4.220448915308584
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.6344669393721247
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010, but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend.	2.019813782741511
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about.	3.5103159059017046
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement, just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you.	2.2912728228217856
The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF.	3.0506179061843737
Therefore, in future, prior approval should take place in a targeted manner, that is, only in cases of uncertainty or risk.	3.001761322801265
We will, however, consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities, together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey.	3.4461889492080533
We must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - Parliament is sometimes a little extremist, adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green - and, all things considered, find a way to combine the effort made by Mr Florenz and that of other Members, who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible.	2.3282721415962375
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	3.741649580153356
I wonder how this will develop.	1.6930238051842776
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.	2.861011650577259
I think, therefore, that the cost element should be built in right from the outset in the policy of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not the case by any stretch of the imagination.	3.7191568133960087
We would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development, whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself, and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes, included in Objectives 1 and 2, and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located.	3.041027961211492
The second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development.	3.4829740853634923
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life, even when we disagree, the better this will be, provided that we talk about this objectively.	2.796503621386694
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were.	3.343445304035012
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations.	4.104883449625034
Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction.	2.580621762901341
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy.	3.25877489611703
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	3.358236357191206
There is still much to be done, however.	4.729768314395465
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	2.0919655961177646
I would also like to make a more general point.	4.469777468681832
However, I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway, the A32.	2.7474995216203046
There is a second issue I would like to raise.	5.600201953669603
We need proper information, given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past.	2.606363954358636
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today, and not about the Geneva Convention.	3.7400206466946857
Secondly, I also share the Commissioner' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path.	3.172069259490262
Low wages, the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard huts - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are abominable and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves.	2.681384954216054
That is excellent news!	1.5411437303035607
I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field.	2.4725180908868296
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	2.3210448262171233
Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.	2.8239331300319135
What is the result?	20.32170921285915
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper.	2.299445574532433
However, I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion, but also paragraph 10.	4.547825098535806
And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed.	3.1576313468323045
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	2.6895814207165483
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	5.40111281609905
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	2.47050096908656
Second, the fight against fraud, mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened, firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive.	2.414822452411851
We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	2.67191418899829
The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes.	2.6048316539030463
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.1989867918368318
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event.	2.528554295122241
This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs.	2.2008668869923196
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	1.6311331628540837
Question Time (Commission)	2.078946596599252
But, otherwise, we must all of us, as taxpayers or citizens, foot the bill. What is more, the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action.	2.4667027754007838
However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation.	1.6086482114079974
Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally.	2.5366074920987702
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables.	2.792517109724557
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport.	2.273017589561717
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major, high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy.	2.5093602750109856
Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically.	3.70449034994152
However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts.	3.188321747625969
As regards fishing proper, passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit.	1.6297614888043865
This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat.	2.392702204937588
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference, let us consider just two points.	4.1501437385596525
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters, followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid.	2.1847255890115123
We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States.	2.343792045316669
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers.	3.301886113537081
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.	2.7486590377369784
For example, there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future.	2.691387608127205
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House.	2.9655740530654913
It is also an important step towards European natural justice. This will be built on mutual confidence between the Member States and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the European people in any European court.	3.5894243725199
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union.	2.9563422079307804
There are many opportunities to hide.	3.072669868989811
As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification.	3.146997544631568
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves.	3.0998349691434663
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.	2.876281161785593
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved, however, we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance.	4.454882607460656
Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order in relation to the activities organised today by the Association of Parliamentary Assistants in support of their call for a statute for assistants to be adopted as soon as possible.	2.859281424032534
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one.	2.7195105039555045
Putting that on one side, because that is the situation, it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues.	3.6647435666044044
But is there not more to it than that?	1.8896213662509591
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate.	1.968454165888851
On the one hand, the political excommunication of Austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought. On the other hand, if tomorrow the governments of European Union Member States must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies, then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed.	2.652567583525873
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).	2.826154337656127
The report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year.	4.155517621367294
As far as this is concerned, a number of people have already referred to the fact that the Commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis, with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future.	3.0863438333215867
Now that is not a contradiction, since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law, as detailed in Recommendations I and II of the report, is actually about taking action in the EU' s own interests, which, as far as that goes, does not damage the legal interests of the Member States; on the contrary, it protects them, at least indirectly.	3.527968040979653
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato' s report.	2.6448547622178973
I think that, with this report, we are, once again, one step closer to the realisation of the internal market.	4.727108511014372
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated.	1.56103284648991
We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure.	3.270236556691612
Parliament is committed to this task, which is something this report bears impressive witness to.	2.7097097169220183
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters.	2.0754552968956466
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land.	2.3352590993878874
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions, to the extent that we are providing you with options.	2.9221304460281723
We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour.	3.5435554091171326
However, that is precisely what is happening.	7.142383100722169
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd.	2.4405889388521667
I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue.	3.4875219783358116
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem, i.e. Communism.	2.486769915809814
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.	2.8396863642356114
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	2.8792105732489075
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition.	2.876551347571862
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	2.396118255148969
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion, as recommended by the rapporteur, of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives, taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point.	3.141891120025558
Statement by the President	13.427798004601405
It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts.	1.8728961313733001
This solution would not, in our opinion, be a fair one and indeed the Commission would have no irrefutable figures to support it.	3.2674210239254027
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	2.745419309617554
Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say 'irreparable' .	2.5789597978884067
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision.	2.3313167253282976
Agenda	21.75018985665072
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack' s very emotionally-charged contribution.	2.989675600027815
(The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you.	2.743284970250507
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	2.5580682822101735
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House, namely to introduce such an area.	4.27819161698692
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now.	2.95324161125253
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, in my view, this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses.	3.1261726583005998
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed, particularly, and most seriously, by companies which are making huge profits.	2.461125343986024
Mr President, this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud, nepotism and corruption in the European Commission.	3.5113045655297315
Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered.	4.1357894189029105
They have all been persuaded!	1.8787522271851977
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods, about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance.	2.6254309525020236
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses.	2.985985857173176
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	2.645652844534022
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.	4.488996320593346
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	3.4315220335486756
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council.	2.293205869243229
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity.	3.197931774573636
As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities?	2.384975059628498
Under the European Community' s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million.	2.007050167266099
We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation.	2.856214943687453
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order.	2.4814772201206043
It should continue along this path.	1.9652331654652027
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism, which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment, after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment.	2.9866678717858477
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs.	1.7890261038063657
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	2.802746135622844
Nothing has happened!	1.9332045894949283
Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence.	3.847732754996029
By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon.	2.6107329573931044
The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe.	3.1045954906224504
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	3.079752269578365
Subsequently, if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised, then I will do this.	3.312126138890794
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees?	2.0821200101877846
Therefore, we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and, to this end, I ask that you support Amendment No 95, which has been presented by our group.	3.191009566442026
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	2.7877797145320233
As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans.	3.033006941145536
- (PT) Although this Community initiative, LEADER +, follows on from previous initiatives, it has some unique features.	2.4894876706590523
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable.	2.6357224904082575
As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition.	2.5880803326842834
There are two approaches.	4.739129460292945
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children.	2.373579772202818
Within these regions, a huge range of problems have their part to play.	2.0923497488630853
In a sense this is where its work begins.	2.3782071432715344
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us.	2.6048077525851143
This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4).	2.4922039302810965
The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process.	3.1081820804113574
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time.	2.6467129654265302
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting.	3.3821158230692814
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment: nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading.	2.369097983423011
And this is the result.	19.731981228174465
We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	2.693170856352496
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively.	2.801898174745296
Mr President, early last year, the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future.	2.754653327025282
Mr President, I should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which, nonetheless, concludes that, as a Community, our accession to these two WIPO treaties must not boil down to a mere institutional development, however important that may be, i.e. the opportunity for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly to work together.	3.2236205195145935
All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area.	3.7121918902164945
We need specific proposals, both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies.	2.5725776279802566
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	2.7292728602051044
However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies?	2.4053758279620006
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations, lay down clear rules, which will benefit all of us: businesspeople, investors, workers and the citizens in general.	2.5057241674020867
No notice was given of the closure, and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers, despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private.	2.2134736756314837
We are all entitled to clean drinking water.	3.2328861827024857
Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.	2.7665889944036435
Malta is entering the accession negotiations.	2.6988249837952614
This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe.	3.890288033616829
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation.	2.72497016743583
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.	2.8132118274112345
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	2.6783025840202797
We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.	2.8762865307914582
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	2.977841433389553
How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place?	3.3296963916442235
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation.	3.8373000835897875
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	2.597237351299416
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime, drug-dealing and gangs.	2.501709076106676
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not.	2.7166193233698097
I believe that the European Union must do likewise.	6.437176980172775
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement.	6.518962562093264
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin.	3.163366639707739
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute.	4.163864907089226
Danube environmental disaster	987.2787267004136
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.	1.8454894425693689
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.	3.6029564606550757
Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda.	3.34837141936563
The debate is a deeply political one.	2.990921531877994
It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets.	1.8048685206538302
Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.7715548372124976
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	1.5758955451256547
Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion.	2.610375738020726
This is why it is essential to approve Amendment No 2 to Recital 4 which avoids the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re-evaluation procedure.	2.5058417143001734
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	3.6578956168649435
How many meetings of the group have been held to date?	2.94128402600624
I am waiting for the Commission' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions, which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999.	4.076929815248665
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	2.2528839859395076
In essence, we are, of course, in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative.	3.72797948482266
We must be sure that, in seeking allies in the area, we must not always choose anyone who offers.	4.459826294446248
What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States.	4.4197319323234865
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President, Fernando Cardoso, the Finnish Government, the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995.	2.5158411755152295
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions.	3.0688082427257664
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly.	2.5057497645596785
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men' s report should be implemented.	2.2586209122126912
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19%, to which it has fallen over the decade, to at least 23-24% of GDP, both in the private and in the public sector.	3.0545107399518487
All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.	3.784129418813188
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to present to you certain information about the re-opening of the intra-Cyprus negotiations and recent developments in this area.	3.988675635719643
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive, Article 11 for example, which relates to good practice?	3.0587834487343932
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	3.69489363187577
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too.	3.8385500078881702
The Tibet Intergroup, therefore, gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in Tibet and supporting the Dalai Lama?s proposal for dialogue with the Chinese Government to resolve the situation in Tibet, calls on the Commission to appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet to address the concerns of the European Union and to help bring the Tibetan and Chinese authorities together for dialogue.	2.8966197383705516
That would seem odd to me.	1.5322469562307501
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing.	2.100721081007151
Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates.	3.300077275233436
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development, because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective.	3.337274353291147
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	2.257450570470753
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	4.596655398060564
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb/Delors Agreement.	2.8705905947821195
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community.	3.082515649070304
Seeing the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field, because they were the first ones to develop that area, gives one food for thought, I feel, and I think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies.	2.957576519972281
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today?	3.7156791611798377
Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised.	2.993521246175716
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights.	2.697091694609816
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner, changing tack in mid-course, and is nowhere to be seen.	2.648234118008427
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place.	3.8878636728995675
The polluter ought to pay.	2.2218392116621795
The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness.	4.137405827839448
On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party.	2.4190213242858776
The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)).	2.152167411770323
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.	2.7464162446058795
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the European Union, from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy; even to the response by the 14, the Commission and Parliament to the new coalition in Austria.	3.726952987042294
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament, the Council or the Commission.	3.8408313565098227
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false.	2.6859761848695967
Madam President, to begin with, I would like to make one thing abundantly clear: Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion.	2.8876022569931545
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended))	2.1507514256777185
This has happened, as previously mentioned, with the MAGPs. These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission, compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data.	2.737257413751879
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately.	1.5989449391371626
This is what we need to do for the Balkans.	5.230226777639409
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	3.3487582883005653
Colleagues, you know the rules.	2.492433780201224
Thank you for listening.	6.5803136123263855
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	4.390525095369277
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	2.2425470652293473
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber, and this is only an estimate.	2.468689751501088
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States.	1.974011396693683
Surely Assad would be Barak' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister.	1.9741073800109694
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	4.898753636918425
I think ours is a different approach!	1.8860000901453668
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will, I hope, address this situation.	2.8380920174713524
But, quite apart from this, we would like to emphasise that, if we are to strengthen the coherence of European Union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the Union, we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the European Union itself.	4.263316617615872
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	4.962755095110914
This proposal can therefore be approved.	1.8363422210501723
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	2.1190497655138443
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	1.5242224269192266
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time.	2.4343215915468717
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment.	2.9713868713267932
There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider' s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days.	1.913797320347008
Subject: New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) is still operating from the same temporary premises, even though its new building was opened in June 1999.	2.014044779843104
This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union.	7.43819720001035
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides.	1.8709890265463625
May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.	3.0451561152451583
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether.	2.5942572446560876
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	2.1306072774156686
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector.	2.1483976848368362
It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its raison d' être, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber.	4.342539016781904
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient?	2.251179316184265
I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions.	4.347061476038121
I understand your concern, Mr Napolitano, and an interinstitutional working group will be set up. Its first meeting should take place in March.	2.664117708519956
On a separate matter altogether, I would like to support Cuba' s membership as an ACP country within the framework of the new Lomé Convention which will shortly be agreed between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.	2.702256913989398
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union.	2.051287893646322
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service.	5.431524321647701
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation.	1.5036033603825951
Here, Mrs Lienemann, Mr President, we are putting forward here a practical proposal, a common sense proposal, easy to implement, likely to limit local conflicts and to vindicate the proper use of public monies, before increasing the LIFE budget line by as much as 40%!	2.5584718566934708
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper, despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe.	3.027612027251712
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group.	1.9153351721966771
Europe is a community of law.	4.379588158989517
This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.	5.672828582045403
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	3.1847405041810153
Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern.	2.648673588535957
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	1.9367253558600592
However, according to the SCRS study, the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries.	2.061457430056625
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required.	3.287076957746838
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance, a dialogue between security and freedom.	2.004905570366116
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs, as has been the case in the past.	3.343902901317742
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	2.6562605356635434
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.	3.223371030180298
I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model.	2.831726011494431
The concept of transparency stands out in the report.	3.9657874293788917
Has any thought been given to the matter?	3.555638448569875
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.	2.1028813448490276
Such a rule is only normal.	1.4879580309203952
I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs.	1.9237035097190194
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency.	3.7997070359097873
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.	3.214266045121107
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock.	3.2427441350015105
We have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic Commission was mistrusted, doubted and feared by the citizens of the European Union because they were mismanaging our affairs.	3.301217543827834
We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	4.620753191578822
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme.	2.827973523692
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example.	4.234128911074323
As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions.	3.60153786057209
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	2.7675660996462224
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	2.6134426412171545
It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies.	2.1781709136486977
We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all.	2.2843153909915825
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	2.3485574000911273
We need this at European level and internationally; we need something like a TÜV, an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany, which is compulsory every two years.	2.2957096735974694
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that Mr Corrie' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with South Africa because, in the final analysis, this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the European Commission is taking ever more frequent recourse.	2.7079931646336393
The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers.	2.1931543999606533
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.	2.19427322443971
I believe that is a good thing	10.340158896433543
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	3.3180921640933017
That proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service, the development of efficient safeguards for consumers, and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive, gradual evolution.	3.050143619255805
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	3.5627320260022888
However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism.	2.484421431378602
Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.	2.3591519538844503
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly.	1.7102253909121625
I urge the Commission to be less cautious.	4.960073887157832
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	3.7500673539964957
In view of the humanitarian aid being given by the European Union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration, Mr Bernard Kouchner, what measures will the Council take to defend the rights of the women of Kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women, women in confinement and new-born children?	2.896426281898324
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come.	2.7867866222557103
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement.	2.14330380730754
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.	3.998698693163569
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	3.1573278156027307
The time has come for Israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories, at last recognising once and for all the authority of Palestine, whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of Yasser Arafat.	2.110362648037755
As regards derivatives, I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath, for example.	2.8804227362699146
It also creates protection for software and databases.	1.7707229247078937
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 22 February, ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco, the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.	2.835495812442601
That is my initial response to the threshold question.	2.7834307641578566
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?	2.6045721086559626
I do not have exact figures, but the Community' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller, to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office.	2.7621679505997223
Mr Provan said that I often talk a lot about tourism and information technology.	2.064903327323592
The latter element continues to be the Commission' s fundamental objective, as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit, in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term.	3.1751912231196253
.	77.3301660757284
Most of the report is about financial control.	6.763543408393395
Amendment No 33 is ambiguous regarding 'the language' of the guest member state, especially when there are various official languages, and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages.	3.100704723173922
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.	2.402196472398911
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings, the connection with BSE has still not been clarified, as I have already said.	2.4276484263754763
In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services.	2.222330337547548
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems.	3.938794356391474
Next, I would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the Union' s Member States who, in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.	3.1502103110823647
To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions.	3.0297965358749814
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation.	3.2766419927569626
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	3.3918231875948996
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	1.690104740725206
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote.	2.8484858678198606
We have endeavoured to provide material help.	1.7379523284549885
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	4.487340098581242
This is an irreparable loss.	4.992658283191967
Should this be condemned ecologically, Frau Breyer?	3.1549910178646785
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation.	2.1675371209652488
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right.	2.4618934727897144
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	1.1672026996941478
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.	2.258882417277767
Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	2.5409695797143925
That, combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country, in the area of minorities and democratic institutions, would round off the image of political maturity which FYROM has, in fact, presented in other respects and which has made our European family welcome closer relations with it.	2.6580148804053434
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point.	4.031963105615439
Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	2.8963253812899263
I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low.	2.188704453408028
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy, I question whether today is the time to be holding it.	3.278633276038426
With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination.	2.0030490078911534
First let me speak about the economy and social development.	3.2241961315591205
However, I can assure you that we do not, with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions.	3.9814007557287985
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis?	2.0709441660370964
For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement.	2.3290524383000517
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community.	3.9068044949515666
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000.	2.4636792800164837
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions.	2.217580650412421
It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are.	2.890728803417134
I have already appeared before the French Senate.	2.5726867383054914
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue.	2.758933016195855
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it.	2.642068728209651
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	3.9834471151917827
After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced.	2.0808491097944115
How strange that the Commission should lose its instinct for self-preservation just as Europe is integrating.	2.5459880289307937
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term.	2.6946482930101894
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected.	3.4574552581425704
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject.	2.4966650341529926
In those circumstances, consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result.	2.9916298995819974
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date.	2.3196840035045527
Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent.	2.206539061784003
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	3.2629645804051264
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	3.6574302508392313
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth.	4.4802024886964995
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues.	3.5885058852541696
Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much.	3.5586342670586286
All laudable stuff.	1.0873651586478519
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality.	2.1483302450315884
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	3.601848743858147
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent, because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns.	3.014514646680694
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years, here in Parliament.	2.8306171070968174
In fact, taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade, and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new Member States, the Commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements, and to apply competition rules at Member State level in a more decentralised fashion.	2.659257171108936
We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action.	1.921209876266332
If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings.	2.6133406147730858
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	1.9525279058407976
Was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success, or to say, "I am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms" , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation?	2.3111152668060053
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	2.326321905442616
What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this?	3.5496168872782934
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	2.2311956519134895
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d'intention.	3.191094633474451
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	3.757952239115612
That time is now past.	2.072537233274664
That is a clear complaint that we get.	4.500060626778737
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	3.3611021923989064
Second reading of the Florenz report (A5-0006/2000)	1.7070258436500931
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.	2.01186477708868
I understand what you are saying.	3.1682703234628624
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	4.018522655688977
If tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all, we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned.	2.749051430478104
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.	2.7326285900662963
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	3.8581954932447706
This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report.	2.0481920274192134
- (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party.	2.686348747290704
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities.	2.9995986723623127
I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada.	2.4136505734575677
Paradoxically, but truly, the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect: the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller.	1.9188330692414777
And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition.	3.8365627433662857
We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society.	2.1533496475595157
He went back to work, rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions, but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round.	2.5096743583429113
My question, which has not been answered, is why, when the European Parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the European Union, the Council and the Commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether.	3.338813259674473
The proposal cannot therefore be approved.	1.7995280540545087
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	1.5699171099196974
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	3.1705097683282655
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States.	2.3052039579584647
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia, in Galicia, for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products, on a site which will only employ three workers. This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa, where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry.	2.8226524443892513
However, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years.	3.5733246710240474
Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China' s Communist Party.	2.236867058833422
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed.	2.082488648684008
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent.	2.9890663456697277
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it.	2.452947266627469
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer.	3.3666399106955844
Over 80 measures are envisaged.	1.5639998465199383
In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	2.296208007735557
The amount of budget required by our cities - where 80% of the European population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in Europe, I believe, clearly indicates that the European dimension should be taken into account and that this URBAN programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail, not to prioritise and, therefore, not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities, by means of European funds.	3.0809206728543357
Women deserve more than a quota.	2.942273017245563
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle.	2.917233917750434
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account.	2.658939493428748
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.	2.461681312809962
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries.	5.270001269395211
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system.	2.62144890202252
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either.	2.6989770087569287
There were women everywhere.	1.2934313673645306
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	2.0510346886040725
In that sense, the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow, which contributes towards stability in the area, is de facto a move in the right direction.	2.6637546585123792
It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape.	2.2745738090195986
Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule.	6.292356794730246
For example, I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques, whose situation we are discussing, according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola.	3.002316866952922
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	3.2941132392073484
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research.	2.658629311200621
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.	2.072837530762627
Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario.	3.297781443021013
It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level.	3.226914044236703
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	2.591339297054909
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system.	2.224127696204067
The proposal from the Council, the common position, is that manufacturers should pay the lot.	4.562707894039336
As in employment strategy, there are four thematic areas: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament' s proposals.	2.8754359182809996
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants.	3.4079264187526803
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	2.6430484243371595
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property.	2.480682670530899
We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs.	2.8457185513737557
Strasbourg, 17 February" .	3.309290030178651
No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity.	3.2746105493137696
As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	2.3610269020676697
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.	2.5816848430282535
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union.	3.040783922918451
Perhaps, in order to strengthen the Union' s democracy, it would now be appropriate to isolate Austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the Austrian citizens, while bringing Turkey and its "Grey Wolves" into Europe.	2.6834860906506854
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	2.806244552354061
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	3.088856844492511
This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector).	2.487157192262061
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us. I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections.	2.693007390065156
He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this.	2.713651456537895
Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring.	2.9696450050399994
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue.	2.404448428108277
Question No 10 by (H-0053/00):	1.1672026996941478
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent.	2.7790163641066523
The European Commission' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the Union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes.	2.5565976459400557
Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it.	2.9047830603891174
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States.	2.3032082009918744
What we need are not just reforms of the World Trade Organisation and the economic architecture - and, significantly, the President of the Commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture; we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens, who rightly expect help and support from and in the EU with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances.	2.946748228662076
Mr President, I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague.	4.185279141133334
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU's food safety regime in the years ahead.	3.272402605789198
Article 34, a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam, only lays down the new form of a framework decision, and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union.	2.9146008179959084
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate.	4.691286324868623
Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	2.8169061513140163
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies, this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances.	1.9446116095505421
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.	2.9916740680049716
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom.	2.39477586462432
However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings.	4.705401750405876
Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States.	3.1051946584122416
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say.	2.219538852207734
In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies.	3.1540906130140285
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	3.6993508405272797
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death.	1.8694268887774843
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	3.3485369678501655
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?	2.9707877036528734
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it.	3.2393035523053357
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate.	2.9827889596171286
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter.	2.4127723308030404
On every occasion, and as recently as last October in this House, the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions.	3.129584627543442
In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible.	2.8870402359193337
And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long.	3.9418708079242064
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war.	3.1680532184030725
That shows that competition really is working.	1.73942220637294
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process.	2.32201729681614
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said.	2.5009620946219293
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union.	3.171718213426156
A word on the White Paper: the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy.	2.717167950051854
This, however, does not seem feasible.	4.839963901213592
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.	3.1110816092683335
The cost of maintaining the environment, which we all enjoy, must be met by all of us, and the LIFE programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective.	3.7370802598880313
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	3.246142847028721
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	2.097122620416612
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy.	4.9198719119633205
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port, regardless of all the port charges.	2.3304751215338935
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President.	4.486979563886021
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3.	1.6099625076647766
"On 17 February, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, received as guests, at their request, the representatives of the Forum d' Ermua.	3.010529900990019
Mr Bösch, I take note of your observation but, clearly, we hold this type of Conference of Presidents, open to all MEPs at the original request of the MEPs, so that they may participate in some of them.	2.9088646362613066
I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it.	4.002764006920302
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.3883497032016954
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.	2.8560031114592914
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government.	2.145990102581426
I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened.	2.6335084581434054
We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable.	2.8805602286581884
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment.	3.4572434982905085
Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission.	4.484918907884277
You are unclear about this in your White Paper.	1.8289278129170126
This also applies to whistle-blowers.	4.2076248149965885
Worker involvement is always, and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring, not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations.	2.720361674620059
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources.	2.058310465790468
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	1.9663251751775683
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone.	2.9010917390212274
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.5224621375435476
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	2.4999842674464734
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment.	2.440673744499662
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	3.9237288055268182
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	1.8982383602034965
On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	2.6683190315388288
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.	3.312862071847438
In Europe, after the Amoco Cadiz, or the Urquiola on the Spanish coast, in 1976, or the Torrey Canyon, in the same year, or the many other cases there have been, we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995, particularly in the last few years.	3.348407586305162
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.	3.4481295575083366
Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis.	3.2652641218105773
I think we should reinstate this budget line.	3.2802202823761952
It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector.	1.8676826282841865
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	1.8037991688848058
Amendments Nos 39, 40, 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives.	2.3515828032829647
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	2.0373450577611565
As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries.	2.4600977118255765
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman. Let me add to that, the importance of the post offices.	3.7941383180193236
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	4.486689515282313
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe: our economy does not support the individual sufficiently, nor is it sufficiently dynamic.	2.364639471617593
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world.	2.302052279729033
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	2.633617859775332
This is largely due to historical factors.	1.611428828600495
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	3.660476655307838
It is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the Council, in accordance with Article 190, and the assent of this Parliament, to which it falls to approve this statute.	3.6363678370786796
Secondly, to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds, in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism.	2.772341076140331
As regards other aspects of this subject, Mr President, I would refer you to my written report.	3.0368766753849723
I welcome Mr Amadeus' statement this morning, which acknowledged the difficulties of non-budgetisation of the EDF, which called for a more active role for the Development Council and which called for development priorities to be central to the EU' s emerging common foreign and security policy.	2.443008818603855
I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems.	2.5648863179277086
(Applause, heckling)	3.4049177142781253
Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth.	3.0309831914647227
Furthermore, this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission' s involvement in this undertaking.	4.362016090772503
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	3.4483561271649106
First Part	72.17482167067989
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context.	3.2529429085949575
They have lost their status, and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant.	3.279367006308909
Let us remember that for half a century, Europe has provided us with peace, security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity.	2.4414605281116164
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit.	3.9625519882203295
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol.	2.814457781450609
Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible.	2.581801212488784
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.531277521076661
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development.	3.07260321181003
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	3.0923169235472345
This is not impossible.	13.29800417800947
However, we in the Committee on Agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws; because this proposal also encompasses genetically-modified organisms, we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health.	2.660756350561169
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.	3.522777042435046
We asked for a whistle-blower' s regulation, and this is now in place.	3.1945797638615705
Clearly, any future social action programme should take account of developments, for example within information technology, and, in time, become a modern social action programme.	3.1148762420564906
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	3.362688176906949
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified.	2.7960115924293287
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives.	2.503880295232855
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed?	1.8868990347071821
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered.	2.400489890827531
I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed.	3.113864218032991
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	2.9305630559187636
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	2.753511099243329
In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most.	2.4523348323645737
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing.	2.705062144424353
For who can believe for one moment that private firms, motivated only by profit, will continue to provide services in high-cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not, therefore, in a position to take advantage of the service.	2.636537066112766
Clare Short, MP, is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and, as such, can take her case to the very heart of government.	3.0965597007308023
This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure.	3.7908942135885795
One of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex, but this could be said of any tax. If this argument had been accepted in the past, then no taxes would ever have been created.	2.8883724484257614
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them.	3.166491643740654
It did this as well.	2.225471547386888
In this respect, Mr President of the Commission, I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population.	4.030722327988729
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem, and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement.	2.5476489663151356
Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions.	3.1084977928147404
If we fail to complete it, citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement.	1.890316334107388
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease.	3.300713831524201
. (IT) Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, has already pointed out, we can certainly consider URBAN a success for the European Parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations.	4.204233419257371
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent.	1.4991448382580388
However, the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics, drugs, growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms.	2.710702759851571
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this.	4.1599173245999985
It has not yet been passed by the Council; it is at the consultation stage.	4.536797707945978
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information.	3.609397033789441
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	3.3539402924700052
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates?	3.3502481188621274
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary.	4.427666687551821
It has led to a critical and tragic situation in Angola.	2.1461995021428435
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and, more importantly, objectives which are enforceable under the law.	2.3481893069683983
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States.	3.159212923876782
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer.	2.81665199728059
This is a moral interest, a safety interest and is, ultimately, even in the interest of our economy.	2.9088772158879634
That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.	4.472306059676532
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation, especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue.	2.1226316392810536
There is also no doubt that, throughout the debate this afternoon, we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies.	3.7837484657409823
This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people.	2.5494810201474403
Mr President, there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance.	4.801769897510702
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.	3.9976362557720173
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas.	3.4029167725804776
The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation.	3.358716861164927
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer, the vendor, or whoever, should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost.	2.0661950764014216
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	2.0051643176189238
Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda.	2.759849991345142
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.	2.455648993701216
Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection.	1.9018726607727983
Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can.	4.380774304387707
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	2.741609744085753
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria.	1.5641141726458412
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas.	2.884676734880833
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments.	2.0535076299300288
I would also like to support Mr Titley' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.	2.9956505234487136
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable.	3.937824842218839
Firstly he talked about verification.	1.4881272101126755
In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all.	2.929469996856178
And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused.	2.8171764174051077
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4.	2.7489742173455642
Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS))	2.177607504221072
I share the Commission' s preference for the use of global grants while urging, however, that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined.	3.0421049029983616
It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations.	2.718451234735506
It is an integral part of the tension, inherent in the very concept of European integration, between solidarity and cooperation between Member States, with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy, and competition, which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the European Union as an entity.	3.2543998101231066
Quality, sustainability, innovation are at the forefront of the Commission' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the Council of Ministers.	3.0251016166456384
In the divided situation which has now arisen, we therefore consider that the Council' s wordings are the best.	2.739797481734624
Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform.	3.4803895255423902
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so?	3.1478433848629352
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals.	2.650662367606132
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses.	2.4347648164098685
Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	2.864569697838656
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	2.1497767541781934
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views.	1.837972258992303
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.	3.6552306684359555
Mr President, the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable.	3.7504835425825775
Our response must be rapid.	1.4788439227503336
I am referring to Recommendations 1 and 2.	2.5878585145565185
In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either.	3.1062221274775843
It was very small.	1.7548680829733028
I am proud to support such a resolution.	1.6520334034278261
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	1.974758699400959
The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks.	1.924403930316925
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation.	1.9690146413144927
Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions.	2.6086300483160483
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations.	2.767475704617362
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount.	4.746552883889143
I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water.	4.734539557814996
She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras.	2.7424793184949867
I wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the Commission to take the French Government to the European Court of Justice on the application of France's Loi et Vin, which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in France?	2.7536404148940967
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence.	4.335737758877496
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere.	3.534611646404786
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	2.912586422718336
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production.	2.760382410029639
What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision.	3.4407214994392294
I can hardly wait, Commissioner Byrne, to hear what you have to say to our proposals.	3.403899586326048
But we should not lower our standards too much either.	2.4357882758270244
This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!	2.78586707796325
I come from a region, Galicia, which has suffered similar accidents in the past.	2.695694627446298
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government?	2.566686953607207
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted.	2.106969206270824
"The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle.	2.4217706425995864
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets.	3.6348596101328994
In return for this greater degree of autonomy, managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions.	2.0108484382027054
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives.	2.977309706844129
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law.	3.2660634853491075
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	3.579396194715151
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other.	2.1009647544132264
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents.	2.570013985527072
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	3.996039006733285
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace, although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible.	2.493795262816731
Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece.	3.120860369128239
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union!	3.4034158292484427
In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law.	2.9677543594465097
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is 'Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket' .	2.538510797042207
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament, spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government.	2.7548447389279875
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made?	1.7737600018236899
In contrast, at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators, for example a regulation of such relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in collaboration with representatives from the two branches.	2.7702057706108367
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	2.118725579309257
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people.	4.082560418303391
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.	2.3746660966576956
Mr President, Commissioner, when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation, we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly.	2.8354952586310738
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage.	2.9666937956133634
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved.	3.0096980117737333
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions.	2.4336962380491043
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money.	3.99933482965406
President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans.	2.7738584217449307
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too.	1.4530610850638086
Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe.	3.1525213280822904
We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve.	3.31148315694342
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	2.0472888653722907
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed, even by its Presidents.	2.800155873950581
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons.	2.9570735961397157
In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process.	2.2937787172799933
I think this is a good agreement.	5.784721727614893
This is why I am voting against the report.	3.8112589878744214
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission.	4.453252726328696
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage.	3.35751307909622
All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict.	6.374143146396921
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting, we do not need another to add to those already available.	3.145839428711828
Everyone is free to hold such views.	1.6839296192930309
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there.	3.0929332159909673
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	3.495813497765933
The next item is the report A5-0035/2000 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 1626/94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222(CNS)).	2.2238562173149847
But you never lost hope and history proved you right.	1.498279296361751
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union.	2.2889264566427485
Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries.	2.650784487461816
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal.	4.695571807605816
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	2.5268192710577644
Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party.	2.810978144719578
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled.	2.9973420256931678
In the meantime, the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist.	2.4290756323840155
Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya.	6.358760588901655
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year.	2.016906002745586
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	2.7829478582325025
Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' .	2.740785918695502
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety.	4.311598092504576
Without agriculture, the rural world will disappear.	1.9670648476704076
Ultimately, the polluter must pay.	2.0473693414487326
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	5.808357897439378
You talk about greater transparency, but produce proposals which would lead to documents which, at present, are available for public inspection being locked away.	2.5120661863608302
I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned.	2.3688688245101552
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin, by Mr Miller, whom I thank for his personal message, and by many others.	2.7706649724681567
The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government.	2.3443574193134684
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation.	3.3160351099437477
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	2.9079398959300766
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion.	4.034868524289955
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	3.0356543658504984
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire.	3.9347388326391632
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	3.8311984016608456
Must there be an IGC?	1.8137732516232898
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear, proper economic and biological picture emerging.	2.0560606493987654
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe.	1.443524887762826
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	2.0965678374205936
This is of great importance, especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market.	2.629568355099931
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner.	3.037761644169544
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour.	3.627095763381754
A number of technical provisions need to be made, such as the installation of a computer network, archives, a canteen and furniture.	5.017480659094696
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes.	3.0124288531488244
He is not always right, but in this case he is.	4.205763370698185
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	2.95805462814687
These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives.	2.4145335969802804
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign.	4.760658250290065
Mr President, a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes.	2.9946260189854947
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems, we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible, although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them, of course, as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make, and also in view of the fact that, in any case, satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels.	2.71126109439904
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster?	3.3459035258652197
At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction.	2.710153296120596
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries. These include technology, trade, cooperation in the field of research etc.	2.595714289006029
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	2.275411351641098
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform?	1.5060037430061513
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them.	1.6696643478565683
I should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling, reuse and incineration, as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions.	2.6962310586542917
Since then, the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation, they have exploded exponentially and without restraint.	2.2636425867766388
In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate.	2.8960221920673286
As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence.	3.2709898640015407
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries, 90% of which are our ACP partners, estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15%.	2.5561433991831457
This is one such case and discussions are under way between the Danish Government and the Commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter, to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who, as things stand, have a right to this pension.	3.5752834832830467
Mr Nielson, what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy.	3.3941565757145256
The destructive effects of the CAP and EMU on the balance between regions, especially on the vitality of the more rural, the more remote and the least populated regions, is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a sinecure, far from it.	3.255679815239417
Is the Commission aware that, in order to lift immunity, it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable, including former and current Commissioners?	3.1851634148114623
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b, and 217 local action groups participated in it, with financing of EUR 1 155 million.	2.364224550178779
The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse.	1.9297492614769778
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time: in agriculture, commerce, in conflict prevention, in the peace operations, in the fisheries sector, migration and environment.	2.84845092598607
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups.	2.4799231852134485
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control.	1.6891094682226866
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States.	2.8222844755167054
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	2.36989543220989
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	3.514342915329351
For my part, I do not wish to give up hope.	3.5293563588126426
In the Union, sugar is produced from sugar beet.	2.6602362626405114
Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy.	3.0025197779516057
They are already having implications for resource availability.	1.5645614441820344
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry.	2.060024698258594
It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.	2.5852086327993256
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	3.6379424776557747
Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world.	2.666087217776333
As I said, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.451214481469961
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki.	2.8320932053529844
Mr President, since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia.	4.413248063799853
I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	3.093006979261673
I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website.	3.2768447077014278
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer.	3.2174205137414917
Which Commissioners are members of this group?	3.429764745168005
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	2.2809787450637335
As intended by the Treaties and the will of the people, the Commission is the driving force of European construction which is like a rock of Sisyphus which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement. We therefore need a strong Commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament.	3.165679629302551
The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need.	2.168686367588387
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here.	2.865463233723072
When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals.	3.897581936837589
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	2.3918370478147084
We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable.	2.7881372313758126
Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.	2.088100354970043
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union.	3.7032090442266394
At the same time, however, there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate, particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems, together with a need to focus special attention on these countries' own policies for reducing poverty.	2.92690008149095
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	2.8045632440158803
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	1.8063598178815934
Unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum-seekers, we are not worthy of those European values which make up the European identity, as Vaclav Havel said here today, and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity.	2.80887780783024
You know the French proverb, 'Nothing for nothing' .	4.851238397870868
We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible.	3.028487229799321
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved.	2.4742594445543427
By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council.	4.402572960275771
We need policemen in Kosovo right now!	1.5323737121523142
Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy.	2.71289962662727
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna.	2.537783732462141
I should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which, in the Commission communication with reference to INTERREG III and III B, involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of Natura 2000, which I think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems, from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted.	2.6004057828587404
Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds.	3.0975207851486073
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	3.1169243292048345
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation.	1.968256770891228
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	4.071360619405749
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data.	2.366720240247967
By lowering the price/weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post, the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector.	1.9205469757810965
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy.	3.7866985549394863
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law.	2.8051560895741527
It is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in Europe, which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves.	2.555263345873437
Community policy in the field of water (continuation)	2.8132422559730523
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....	3.6404064868318464
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health.	2.549649254560342
For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself.	3.0306700153626105
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing.	2.85411051111966
At the same time of course, we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union.	4.814930596889285
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.	3.151653491194753
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	1.743516117362664
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.4550725128474453
Thank you, Mrs Banotti, and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this.	3.118131307047324
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting.	4.719461543181001
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops.	1.719163373012902
The Austrian People' s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.	3.161229177326335
I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust.	2.2096862540223
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments.	2.3743782479629068
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency?	1.8495042649526132
Therefore, and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne, I reject your choice of legal basis.	2.5881469158568935
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established.	2.584448927494421
Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council.	2.888259669004677
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.847771585005342
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice.	1.96580393578354
The vast majority of them are not members of any party.	2.6676086115287565
It points to the problems experienced in 1999, when, notwithstanding the problems, there was currency and price stability, increased employment, the beginnings of a period of upturn, and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment.	3.313180286774264
It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.	3.140695042543936
I thank the Commissioner, and do not at all question his intentions and interventions, which adopted a positive line.	2.7490515432720337
We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	3.1249561225066858
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	2.603712561049821
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people.	2.2877105075969957
The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today.	2.9104992881370713
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance.	3.488617964763594
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights.	2.423303339641378
It was none the worse for that, but perhaps I will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that I want to touch on.	2.9174669790792542
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for.	3.3752677348347238
No, Mr President, I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself.	5.631493002923966
That it is what we are doing.	9.999949528516005
So it also has to do with environmental protection.	3.569152435596844
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted.	3.113840759494202
I would like to congratulate Lousewies van der Laan.	3.7428526095385104
A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria' s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.	2.5848618849524634
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information, economic as well as biological.	4.670782260202939
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations.	2.8946477464467417
It must be visible.	6.172601270126647
The Employment and Social Affairs Committee adopted several of the amendments I put forward, concerning for example, the emphasis on access to start-up capital, how to exploit new business opportunities in cities, towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business.	2.4915160646762007
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results.	2.9595826650661556
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying.	3.5473702270232295
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened.	2.582663682975814
Question No 41 by (H-0021/00):	1.1672026996941478
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	1.6613526680194617
The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector.	3.4464669909539736
But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission.	3.4699420164453216
Take Sudan.	274.00938673653235
Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo.	3.0112203961824187
With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation.	3.596264334039712
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	3.736555821840107
Too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them.	2.763832383728848
The European Union' s water policy is not starting from zero.	3.0168824733204023
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels.	1.9541479892226388
By way of clarification: if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget.	2.3600557057700096
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people.	3.323122821586236
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.	3.6088411222246792
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems, with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war.	3.0788647032027816
Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal.	1.9873406247494998
Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions.	4.240498352307771
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	2.9868196198052783
On the other hand, prevention is essential.	2.813906959517459
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE.	3.0159264910809696
That is transparency.	1.2826486599536033
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged.	3.8420375839151797
First, any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies.	2.1684303308200445
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	3.46059677141361
Who would want this to happen?	2.205568635193363
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	2.3051188487121976
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA.	2.2211270808923906
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative.	2.915580622240778
We must implement what the directive insists on, that the postal service is available to everybody.	3.385414873988538
Secondly, there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented.	2.908206142348884
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements.	1.6019189586509497
Finally, I would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between Parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions, speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation.	2.385350056675774
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality.	5.000908654297885
Both in Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN, despite the many warnings, appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres, as President Havel pointed out this afternoon.	2.1815080493546897
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location?	2.4401500558166798
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group.	2.8188558470210556
First of all, the policy comes too late.	3.533928221422679
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it.	2.3751658775049207
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	3.133518374948895
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House, as well as to the concern of consumers.	2.8994060690312784
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.	3.0222488665192513
On the one hand, we have been asked to provide Parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and, in this respect, I can tell you that the Commission was last week able to provide Parliament' s Committee on Budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in Kosovo.	2.8955326470414984
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.	2.75070080326524
The fact that, due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data, the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale.	2.3860240314764045
I will not even mention oil; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa.	3.2452663450215553
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations.	2.2026376353771537
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	2.8536938611859406
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority.	2.533785559275135
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue.	2.0122966964525633
I condemn this, as well as the Council' s absence.	3.9251912696507243
But unfortunately, as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber, human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world.	3.0095700105053056
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution.	3.1524610788175247
Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority.	3.4773076040122186
Well, we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses, something we certainly do not want.	3.0915750363417396
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership.	3.1159866832894845
I welcome Parliament's support for that.	1.8917690869237842
Mr President, yesterday' s Minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so-called 'Strasbourg Declaration" which intends to implicate the European Parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that I am a Nazi.	3.50335060232591
(Parliament gave its assent)Relating to Thursday:	1.7313789971520084
Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion.	3.6322078291562905
. (FR) Mr President, before my friends and fellow Commissioners, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four Community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest, I would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of URBAN and INTERREG, which many of you have brought up and discussed.	2.9251991086706375
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation.	1.7510077142914546
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government?	2.595779906348388
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements, as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions, but I believe that they should be the same for everyone!	4.5188239936066
In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years.	3.1472252197420025
During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking "that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."	2.3083940310096533
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma.	2.0676483012740343
I would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work. He listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage, and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence, both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of European mutual assistance.	2.7211624463411566
Tomorrow, I shall be in London.	3.549034487081658
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	2.907255769825524
Commissioner, our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas, while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing.	2.7900719049359406
Every year, we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances.	2.539017011418694
The postal service is not just for Christmas.	5.474880707722828
Still on judicial cooperation, considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro, and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance.	3.7209365981910754
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	3.0732716140978606
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country.	2.171254008125384
Commissioner Vitorino, although I would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable, words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the Council has demonstrated towards us.	2.439512920471435
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	3.206727382484029
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far, perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks.	2.713795475349227
However, it is important, at least in Finland, as a sustainably used, slowly renewable energy source.	4.363731964620731
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences.	3.6904821921344695
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern, so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable.	2.329479657394528
For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances.	3.457591112759621
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	2.997578153818263
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States.	3.1358270812586952
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990.	3.101329137295893
That statement could not be much clearer.	2.6347744761537295
Secondly, even the growth rate of 3 or 4%, something we consider eminently feasible, will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth.	2.6593530526198994
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory.	1.5271661217392234
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	2.9764077645337474
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	2.113410518857557
It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece.	2.7285209498542176
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe?	1.4938894911683958
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic.	2.6377120635212727
In 1953, we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology.	3.3858940053994555
It is the international community, and specifically the United Nations, which should be held responsible for implementing Resolution 12/99 and, in particular, for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality.	4.101389194074827
As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee.	2.5376154166930056
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure?	3.0099848758196575
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged.	3.894358395691484
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	4.3918101828088085
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects.	2.701617585495681
We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in "high quality", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water.	2.568081558086879
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.	3.3330688083503395
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	2.511580097123689
It does, however, have the ambition to break free from this image.	2.670854116575716
I suppose that the first thing they say will be, 'let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union' .	2.497942861167182
That is the reality.	13.519304114947836
This too has not been solved.	3.8441813150865274
So it is a step forward.	6.9562410980793015
From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	2.3214148010698947
I sincerely hope that all Member States will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the Commission has presented to the Council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination, racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur.	3.2771517921778015
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear.	4.2786958756670295
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	2.2524771824601633
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	1.6730585346639717
In that year, we voted against granting discharge.	2.391115513523018
As a farmer myself, I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk.	3.333123441160669
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs.	2.0975391446754323
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission.	3.2347389334146057
However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.	3.885638604234881
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration.	1.8291910198357817
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	1.7605809702796311
We all agree on this.	3.325710495245607
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	3.928137314278959
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	2.84442072901755
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	3.6717283379879406
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin' s 'anti-terrorist' operation in Chechnya.	2.0012990271015414
Mr President, during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was pleasantly surprised.	3.219881918446913
If, by chance, it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, then this could be suggested, both by Member States, and by the Members of the European Parliament taking part in the preparatory group.	3.2239734506543467
However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary.	4.301021338347584
In my country, Austria, new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach.	2.7142001521189445
In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing.	3.0639248392352996
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not, we must wait and see how it works in practice.	3.9701655093496817
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state.	1.990339465569531
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	3.276578750213301
FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right.	3.3109712921648824
As we have heard, the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas, bearing in mind that 80% of the population of Europe lives in cities.	3.1269792174962805
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	2.903799373896743
Through the agreement, the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty.	2.7510585140887676
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few.	2.0603638828715782
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	3.9813188032931612
Madam President, as everyone has said, this is a very important day. It is the day of the first debate of European political life.	4.887230893577408
I was told that this was a personal response.	2.988325035231602
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.	1.8539169224779388
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	2.3342791925385846
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way.	4.400488516144343
Mr President, we have already had this discussion so many times in the past.	4.842572067949015
If we look at the private sector, however, we will find not only that this fabled 'financial stability' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a volcano ready to erupt at any moment.	3.490966030188103
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue.	1.9578060984431311
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level.	2.7484915351259973
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction.	2.6186214064805435
The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts.	2.889634680816798
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner?	1.9961071894025801
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	3.1668317972670326
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union.	2.6557984662466736
I am disappointed in the EPP.	1.970418924292898
We can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers.	1.7504104286512452
The Commission?	1006.8524345315149
This is why we are drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis. This is why we have Article 13 of the EC Treaty on discrimination which we proposed, in our opinion of 26 January even before the Austrian crisis, should be applied after the IGC by qualified majority rather than by unanimity.	2.6431201467586254
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts.	2.9594962717803535
The rules for management companies, for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business, are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations.	2.6160888141235503
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s.	1.911132899195199
In this second report, the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in Parliament, which may have hesitated to remove the European Commission from office, since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members.	3.069130150657485
The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent.	2.4044608285676543
But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council.	3.244629242944184
Mr Alavanos, if an action of this kind should be brought against NATO and if this action were to be brought against Mr Javier Solana personally, we would have to bear in mind that Mr Javier Solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today.	2.730633580611037
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	2.626546274728723
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted, local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux. The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans.	2.214006875211338
There are many interesting questions relating to it, the monitoring centre, the principle of concentration etc. However, I would like to concentrate on the management bodies.	3.106763451441052
Still relating to Thursday' s sitting, the PPE Group has requested that Mrs Cederschiöld' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to Wednesday as the last item on the agenda.	2.0984887162432893
She might well have been abandoned by the large institutions, but we, who worked in Kosovo and Serbia for many years, are doing our utmost to campaign for her release.	2.444657598159456
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work.	2.20626685764672
Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.	4.1360566470224
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens.	2.4804020206753634
We share the view, forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts, and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures.	2.3990462165112962
With regard to the question of Union inspectors, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the Member States, which does not mean that the Commission does not have to ensure that the States carry out their duty adequately.	4.258500553664089
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.	1.7321085696894336
That concludes the debate.	1.5326323786505276
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions. This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity, thus enabling our society to grow, together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years.	2.1600888375847687
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union.	5.049296202472263
In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO.	3.5020019487472167
Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola?	3.614342375708741
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	2.093293434166762
A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us.	2.2166312272542705
Proposal for a joint resolution on coherence of different Union policies	3.0588051337797255
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so.	3.3039991439077134
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	2.4600030033691054
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	2.2423494862784437
President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse.	3.770504770971031
Now, we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully.	4.4096008664072475
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises.	1.9694143400836122
Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery?	2.939718399193072
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	2.8881852255826166
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	2.2084972998923167
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house.	2.6009756624942013
From a political point of view, I always fret when people say, we neither need, want nor can we achieve these things!	2.178998406478016
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking, which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive.	3.1433953588620374
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	2.6163939420633637
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	1.8101029023917918
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that.	3.795647529626821
Mr President, a couple of years ago, the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures.	3.4709799938855896
The Commission' s administration simply does not function particularly well.	2.983714599132344
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible.	2.367516915903948
Mr President, we are therefore wondering, and we ask the Commission - although, of course, Mr Bolkestein is not here, but Mr Monti is a man of many parts and I think he may have a view on this: should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each, and I repeat, on each one of the European Union' s Member States?	3.5734175380092705
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues.	2.3073881600243333
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	3.4314357048949664
Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it.	3.109053740073507
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo.	2.3761455725695133
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals.	7.219764807490451
The European Central Bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets, yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity.	2.006142812498847
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from, among others, scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully.	1.9836732853042292
As for the future, given that the Commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in Austria, I am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of administering a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the Union.	3.650411946079996
The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter.	2.971221858725149
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.	2.4362556605241883
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.	3.4786414289819505
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	2.1614617111243035
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency.	2.6809877041322494
In addition we must build on the Council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25% of ships calling at EU ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered.	1.906770017459054
As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs.	2.402001689464359
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations.	1.9851124439851304
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not.	2.733171071760422
How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc?	3.0177762132607837
In the Commission, systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred.	2.411483938584229
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	2.1997373660387933
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	2.89751818156078
I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question.	3.103011660254979
The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament.	2.6462823445932884
I therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because, as I was saying, it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious, even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities.	2.780508375184907
By embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial privatisations we have also witnessed in Germany, we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation, which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise!	3.398586915147626
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative.	1.9281443896454324
- (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission.	2.4947375444147495
These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period.	1.7242359813368449
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy.	3.043387145956
Provide the Commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at Community level and at the level of the Member States, and we will be - and the Council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at Tampere and move towards a Union which is freer, more just and more secure.	3.3132445553167735
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes.	2.499743011029652
In any event, the Bureau will consider your suggestion.	2.0871395192711546
That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science.	2.870279351937658
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them.	2.9680756842007936
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.770984963503563
The content of my amendment is, in fact, echoed in Amendment No 43, which also stipulates this condition of accrual.	2.6076756419953027
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	2.2526596521264484
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice.	2.420638906500538
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	2.4865809896526554
In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules.	2.969158521431249
Mr President, I am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between Parliament, particularly the Committee on Budgets, and the Commission, and we can assure you that, for our part, we shall always be there to assist the Commission in the performance of its duties.	4.275641598863796
That is an undesirable situation, we do not want that situation in the future.	3.7443088509661044
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach.	2.8085823394615455
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	3.0024468759946292
One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion.	3.4008481830848702
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	2.7628633969128535
This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.85755180765249
Current programmes must be accelerated.	1.4417609997484664
A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	2.4229154695301416
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	2.771455622870983
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	3.008797359200278
The Socialist Group will be voting to grant discharge.	3.3850689909558764
In committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by URBAN.	2.5783162486368645
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	1.5394856287092933
The cost will not therefore disappear, but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed.	2.484825962147566
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully.	4.336050328812229
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.	3.822611945060149
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	1.9413916353715648
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate.	2.396597695496867
In some cases, it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased, but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware.	3.0915244142991893
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines.	1.7397588359028058
I am glad that LEADER+ is to remain true to this underlying concept.	1.9360045546301747
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily.	3.728372411311591
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	2.413380150178403
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.	2.018062373317637
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected.	2.8527417574840834
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	4.25783486681495
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158).	2.678224707321781
Our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective, not merely within the European Union, but also at world level, given the increasing globalisation of the economy.	3.2552136369316202
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield.	2.657325482116308
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us.	2.6990767164672227
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources.	3.337032197371251
I am, moreover, proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council.	2.6711842895058555
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise?	3.257847969890626
We need a framework of regulations at international level.	4.032780003957057
Firstly, Mr President, although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency, it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of European construction.	3.0140223568989586
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme.	3.404827799148232
That is what Culture 2000 is about.	3.1252488497154984
I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority?	4.721664921776053
In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas.	2.680112900719274
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament, and that includes your proposal, and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it.	3.7230008272690314
In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.	2.7239996004823284
Now to the implementation of INTERREG, a subject mentioned by many of you, and the potential eligibility under strand A, 'cross-border cooperation' , of schemes in the Adriatic, on behalf of Sicily or for the most remote regions, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points.	3.3656143744654354
The other question is who should bear the cost.	2.170182428840218
In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies?	2.944171567060004
The agreement with Macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against Serbia, which is at no cost to us but costs Serbia' s neighbouring states all the more.	2.2811775580511595
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express the satisfaction I have in noting that the most remote regions, including the French overseas departments, have received some attention in connection with the INTERREG III initiative, opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area, even though it is true that more could have been expected, particularly with regard to access to the various strands.	2.857080043092082
The common fisheries policy is not working.	3.5629107772973176
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	1.7224621686149626
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.4090652235943488
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government.	3.280182152774789
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission.	3.950096169114807
I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal.	3.5468445686900676
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality.	2.99677469429249
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading.	2.1761023349132
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar' s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE.	2.9392077878536447
In addition to that, there is the question of duty-free.	7.535581745947149
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration.	3.021339751726657
Thank you, too, those who contributed to this matter' s being dealt with swiftly. I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.	3.2420910849413875
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities, and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves.	2.818843328372072
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments.	2.587971949321526
Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar.	3.1463830538426327
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures.	2.575502493940605
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well.	2.0441169160231283
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.	3.2551519740841455
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem.	3.597591598838439
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999.	3.297372500098269
If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO" .	3.5575542367292172
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow.	1.9532911156219979
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry.	1.8906796719902197
In my view, it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining.	3.8488556731478627
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate.	3.238543119905435
How decisions are made is all-important.	2.5179690642398813
Instead, we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations.	2.9024633911261404
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year.	2.5823046753238565
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.	2.11692652420229
What we need here is good government, Madam President.	3.027126139277111
This is where Mr Solana, the High Representative to the Council, could come into his own.	3.530167206381975
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative, the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue.	4.560631589388739
All this is to the good of the consumer.	4.7410626858431675
On behalf of the combined European right, I must say to you, Mr Solana, as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, we do not have confidence in you.	3.5826079489189526
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	3.044567641935111
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	2.5437657200881714
I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.	2.8643462088583136
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	2.457333921201843
Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive.	2.8559300531450535
Mr President, I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer. I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians.	3.203343266384115
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission.	2.4668077674588584
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
Thirdly, one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground.	2.3792617233207496
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	2.6070669371420334
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact.	4.025434607490746
In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is.	2.7494890099039746
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	4.350381466419769
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.	2.547586399478111
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.	2.2758961598694514
He is a dangerous man.	3.071067531298892
We detest the excess of paper, but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of administration, which some call bureaucracy, are unavoidable.	2.8471670051128055
In whose interest is it really if European taxpayers' money is used to support economic development in Namibia, and if, at the same time, the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically undercut by rigorous export subsidies, financed by the same tax payers?	2.375094779190285
In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk.	2.4837923001599878
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today.	2.749418962225427
A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change.	2.699116783322327
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	3.4948743942498908
I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real.	3.626976334487705
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems.	2.83910702579755
In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out.	3.89437817585894
(DA) The Danish Social Democratic Members of the European Parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution, but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation Denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the Danish delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists naturally wishes to respect.	2.6856963367637166
In my view, instead of "weitergeführt werden müssen" the wording should be "erhalten bleiben müssen" .	3.866656708127745
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado.	2.4340923226963915
We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one.	3.928975296914313
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress.	1.913112798768997
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired.	2.4941788547358357
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same.	2.2498758118980553
Why do I say that culture is important?	3.6687393556747683
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship.	2.290459005080402
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.	5.082361335502087
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends.	4.559816922809914
This talks of the European Union as 'living proof that peace, stability, freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent' and as a model showing the world the way forward. It concludes that 'our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity, and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so' .	2.6886509194096697
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced.	4.214353087229216
We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on.	2.7517517832264407
As regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism.	3.553652694526168
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible.	3.0075253304165157
The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service?	2.3640034181695007
The challenge was immense.	1.3058143935444024
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will, on the contrary, be supporting a number of amendments, especially those tabled by the Greens.	3.6272824919742863
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted.	4.907962749816306
Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies.	2.6959488751682588
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.	3.3817912249375395
We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead.	2.2699599197216185
No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union.	2.6607839915511247
I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process.	3.2097425608079733
Mr Andersson thinks that the less wealthy Eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too.	2.0766120366478478
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.	2.5103741168550364
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	2.897911143498939
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council.	4.946118778116528
We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system.	3.1515822723724565
Madam President, I am totally appalled by the Commission' s, i.e. Mr Bolkestein' s, political ignorance!	4.0642050618950245
Mr President, I would firstly like to point out that I was Mayor of Bilbao during the nineties, which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the Commission.	2.849910583066808
LEADER+ should supplement already existing programmes, avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible.	1.929737608601136
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it, which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision.	3.2256138227514928
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law.	3.311218549346545
They have now got to grips with "EU" .	2.179274169445354
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position.	2.911716387779837
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow.	2.5708318560828034
A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies.	2.4587411356697544
The disease is always fatal.	1.584221954918416
Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity.	3.6138410596698396
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.	2.5543883645558205
This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.	3.3594800558769355
It would be interesting to hear whether the Commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities, so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them.	3.0403970411943506
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities.	2.7683935277862886
Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic.	2.6718867166526254
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force.	1.9730838935380022
This effort was appreciated, even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals, and moreover, Mr President-in-Office, you also expressed different views.	2.3927014574588834
I would like to point out that, within this broad consensus, there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council.	3.145318548656291
Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur.	3.25689064355905
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	3.576104511219877
Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now.	3.3346831027480985
From that standpoint, it is useful that the Commission' s work programme comes back to the issues of Agenda 2000, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly, the activities of the structural funds.	3.8890626449717
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	3.7445047777549036
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	2.874475605322497
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	2.3796633875723785
Mr President, the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser' s or a fitness centre.	4.107928401538482
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them.	1.4740131983714426
We are able but the rest of the female population is not?	2.333413536658972
The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary.	2.4188168856220575
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed.	2.4832518261955814
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	3.2791098641206613
The issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture, trade, environment and biodiversity, but herein lies the real problem: these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the European Union as a whole and in this Parliament in particular.	2.9515052187230726
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	3.0564579521180515
For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption.	2.9165652901331116
Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris.	5.299797351944855
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote.	2.9937781480553083
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices, but not just anything! Most especially, I am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if Europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which, in the 1960s, made me a committed European!	3.1784646499225415
Report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EEC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD))	1.963005171239844
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	6.545350510993755
Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things.	4.068851384683032
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management.	2.771253662912991
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee.	3.0125905528366053
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service.	1.8982656798863011
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks.	2.031421355619335
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid, but much further out in our galaxy, the Milky Way, there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets.	2.6955699901846026
This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	2.886733902562689
Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	2.813149621549158
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.	2.743329762215834
Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets.	3.4788856729492053
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard.	4.229970079194546
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control.	4.457017468681241
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	3.1206633329912505
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this.	2.305766577244572
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge.	3.1337110053193045
I believe - as I think we all do - that Portugal, its former president, Mr Soares, and its government, maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the Balkans.	2.7979781686069756
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy.	2.8600822328518527
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements.	2.387517277603732
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections.	2.502405618421246
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	2.4102754621398645
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.	3.4810871148130844
In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union.	3.5211399124493847
I have explained the position of the Commission.	2.9493449809295766
Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision.	4.769062631944255
Will it be omitted?	3.854732233114295
Europe' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia, the Far East and America.	2.0141505149809964
The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans.	3.4921896288699545
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments.	2.109258360166258
And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned.	3.818883124571727
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	3.7137321286904745
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities. The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly.	3.175229349588647
However, nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it.	2.4724410705546713
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review.	2.7409342557681065
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	3.2417749278058396
This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident.	2.367425507223785
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation.	3.620631868341267
This is also about respecting a culture, a language, a way of life and a people' s religion, a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared.	2.2691456966394896
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service.	1.9608118341520904
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime.	2.6815532695450623
This is all I can say.	4.278098552123684
. (DA) The Left' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER+, the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG, but not URBAN.	2.995399072295396
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee.	2.687949175599893
Personally, I am pleased with some of the replies, for example, in relation to issues as sensitive as Schengen and the Europol Convention, which we hope will be reviewed, and I am pleased with the words of the Minister for Justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities.	3.359781294891189
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding.	2.4167893912818994
Above all, we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice, hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations, in other words, its resources.	3.2127852642453534
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains.	2.2115188032983104
This was acknowledged by the Commission President, Romano Prodi, on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union.	2.660277817338195
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative.	3.633691328935545
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation.	2.5335635982657583
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it.	3.6216028931174744
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration.	3.6348749476055007
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism.	4.671989636934292
We want to talk about coherence.	8.329284208778615
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically, resulting in a loss of jobs.	2.1613967819213666
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality.	1.6406689677633448
That is positive.	1.5686370376207335
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria.	3.696399081869025
And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard.	3.033023122825306
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States.	2.850073540233089
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February.	4.309949441422095
Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II.	4.140054348562299
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added.	2.1122060625076746
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side.	2.928265011327021
Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny.	5.110637092843042
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry.	4.2520672946051254
The second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the end of the first day' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island.	3.0348195076976343
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control.	2.231069508666292
I should like to make one further point before I conclude: we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious URBAN development policy.	2.564360494308599
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly.	2.225989904579827
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament.	3.302572279622973
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	2.5325181863687534
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity.	2.491804546660622
Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.	3.1055385236592814
Freedom, security and justice are the root system of any society, reflecting its history, corporate experience and political development.	1.8101663204994738
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	4.799521725465396
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission' s services on a breakthrough campaign, which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy.	3.304087801736572
This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union.	2.3231901282565492
However, an environmental Europe cannot, in any circumstances, be built at different speeds, but must be built from a point of view of solidarity.	2.5064173668567813
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full.	2.599606022839154
Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	2.5038296476291566
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	4.208708487543353
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	3.11409864455732
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market.	4.0788557444455815
The general interest of policy coherence is, therefore, a responsibility of the Commission as a whole, of the Council, and of the European Parliament.	4.897460513280744
As such, while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science, as some have alleged, it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics.	3.1120276523689725
The figure is now 5.35%.	1.642370695770464
As the Committee on Equal Opportunities, we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women, mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments, and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations, social solidarity.	2.4008979069934875
In addition, experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that, apart from rather dubiously creating jobs, they are not of any great benefit.	2.6322619789804405
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	2.6958560644338934
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures.	4.546639394933939
Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity.	2.7348923097813134
However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that.	2.5037945236806785
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals.	3.4009411139007653
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said.	2.0717578702934887
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	2.767100033367712
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States.	3.3678252108400804
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	1.580226887697392
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	2.7482053050284394
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999.	2.311678899558976
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO.	2.5969461461846546
I do respect and agree with this procedure, as I also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone. However, for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals, political parties, including my own, and institutions.	3.0152926612066207
Another example is cacao.	1.5005050130851219
As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply.	2.0315094989079716
Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	3.3703050587162044
Finally, as has already been said, it is essential, and I hope that the IGC will cover this, to move to codecision with the European Parliament in these areas, with democratic and judicial scrutiny.	4.119671469061231
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness.	2.751472872204769
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said.	3.70335119282231
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first.	3.0296121611695366
We look forward to working closely with this House on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then, most important of all, working together with this House on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities.	3.163024924885471
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	5.124958279696761
They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life.	2.492646399798518
In my judgement, this constitutes a guarantee to both sides, both from a political and a financial point of view, of the commitment they can expect from the European Union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for.	3.4431720429140826
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven.	4.476665506926075
Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level.	2.8321511141871922
One urban district post office after another is being closed down.	1.599618487787232
Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago.	4.199139236082486
After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential.	1.9749819110387534
I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate.	2.1336653336708102
Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure.	2.139400937157798
Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision.	3.518423913165026
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field?	3.400462916403327
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them.	2.386422473289477
It concerns the next IGC.	4.032250751913579
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people, businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition.	2.474921370526177
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	2.624900819072181
In fact, I believe that things have been done by the Commission, but there is still more to do.	5.324960539196176
Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union.	3.187430939394099
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat, for example, from Portugal, from Germany, from Finland, for heaven' s sake.	2.5738561132675
Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union' s main objective - enlargement - because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter?	3.5296605472744504
Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.	2.6585405585862625
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).	2.516583487767945
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th.	3.8918574586170704
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry.	2.1502551888373422
As with all other Community initiatives, this is very positive.	4.79872544245889
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.	3.6014449089108025
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	2.0593566231867837
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon.	4.3491586245377665
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which, when taken together, form a real alternative resolution.	2.089356966421786
We have a new Commission.	9.913019850302911
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail.	2.9196030159925606
Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.	3.2272617043205494
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement.	2.354756528750571
True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system.	4.313287066546095
Secondly, what will happen to the European defence industry which, after all, comes under the more general activities relating to this system?	3.1247960181587158
I would say the same about Amendment No 2, which we would also accept with a slight modification, since the idea seems to us to be basically correct.	2.8821738891130595
Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors.	3.457775950439082
The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	2.4261006903894367
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce.	4.76000967189019
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years.	3.6548246211936766
Did anyone find work?	1.3297319862922024
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council.	3.354035643380345
Yes, e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs.	3.057378857722444
It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource.	2.796524856972414
I should like to make the following points: Turkey is now a candidate country.	3.6079051690855675
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water.	2.5549700164057154
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	3.746843313820331
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science.	2.6102504200111234
These discussions have also recommenced more intensively in the relevant bodies of the Council, and I think that I can say, in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility, and because we all recognise the importance that this has, particularly for the general public, that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of Members of the European Parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds.	3.161491275013702
The joint debate is closed.	1.9284972700132044
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	3.4623544024607833
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament.	2.48950011024911
I believe that this is actually a good thing.	6.139508063520638
However, I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation.	3.8477811187126814
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	3.6346738572844655
Regarding a second matter, now, relating to the additional criteria, which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas. Here, too, I am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the Community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project.	2.9376004305051966
My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me.	2.5035316846650684
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	2.5915269178386318
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information?	2.017411735588492
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes.	2.165846416394604
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well.	2.446909980584071
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily.	4.309527351589031
In these circumstances, even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage.	2.1820996029247235
Well, we cannot accept such statements.	4.352627459562275
You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3).	2.402744153947978
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	2.0868926078270795
From this point of view, the common position is weak.	3.8170469271191205
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish.	3.2553910165268545
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late.	2.963772831144648
Granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well: there will be enough to drink for a while, but tomorrow the well will be dry again.	1.9378739677382075
Some of them have already lost several years' worth of harvests, but the 50% to 80% slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline, and even those in the Channel and North Sea.	2.6250738548161348
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms.	3.02351669321009
In terms of human rights, this is a backward step.	8.277383874147919
In the context of providing information, I would like to draw the Commission' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents.	3.657886500429918
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	2.229055160083082
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	3.154984806808641
Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report.	3.056354656169054
However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition.	3.9857636787680892
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power.	2.8577812972262073
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue.	3.008054628838342
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.	4.341246678818865
It is important for me to have a chance to answer it.	5.558906454854174
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	2.2201639066144163
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II.	1.8761593101726157
That is something we must guard against.	2.712052944725704
At this stage, there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission, demanded by our citizens.	3.4847813844219715
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion, to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union' s regional policy.	3.176504528712416
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.	3.0636196526880877
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation, in which we can set standards.	3.2526764112697184
Indeed, enlargement, which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - I am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete, objective criteria, and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and, to an even greater degree, public opinion in our own Member States.	2.669275302575384
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and this Parliament has done the same.	2.7248276246335377
Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years.	2.8707826741074993
Since the Belgian Government' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken, it is important for Parliament to at last give out a strong message, a message which should signify that nobody can escape a just trial.	2.3061782342324952
In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage.	3.2664699448334478
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example.	2.3379231991823626
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well.	2.525431039277526
Take the fishing agreements, where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters.	2.2004619693758842
Tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the EU.	2.6286695826269724
For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value.	3.4449061334165427
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic	1.825018678258137
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA, given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola.	3.1224987726603604
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.	3.0776829031334922
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	3.1428478466907235
In other words, we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months.	3.2899821079369156
I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again.	3.8012046960112107
What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.7654346799663199
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer.	3.7614770639422366
However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market.	3.397856149704566
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds.	2.9510603272404152
To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal.	2.934443372853919
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment.	1.843917143463127
Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands.	5.055182809278485
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	2.19879900673564
However, we are unable to agree to the text of the report, although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt, for several reasons.	4.3182813510191345
Mr President, Commissioner, at this point in the debate I am going to insist on certain aspects which, from an agronomic point of view, and since I come from a southern country, I consider to be absolutely essential to this directive.	3.321002003499018
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance.	3.8735322386500974
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary.	1.9153186018640826
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	2.5607161613748435
The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain.	2.3791798131354236
Well, I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information, and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it, then we will have bad decisions.	3.1053843892760575
Nevertheless, we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late.	3.1878076060437297
But thank you for your remarks.	3.2208256373101625
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned.	3.9637315945700027
We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention.	2.5012090171743404
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes.	2.516950585326156
Here improvements should be made.	3.084249550396241
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent.	2.0896863669163825
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	2.257643984882993
The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights.	2.6395523598424435
These are serious allegations.	2.2863382128716645
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7.	2.244583219720853
There are four more sister ships in service at present.	1.7748078414045616
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	2.4956612397102598
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval.	3.495987002671983
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	1.839703744786676
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully.	3.7931289430955393
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	3.763880703388986
I agree completely.	1.320486789154135
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved.	2.777772057315679
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe.	2.7340279408510093
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability.	2.51242010699696
So, the concept for LEADER+ should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes.	2.154959785179472
I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant.	2.600044960059918
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines.	3.170249385004118
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	2.677672839671438
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.	2.92201509893976
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	3.218128830055092
I should like to ask the House to wake up, at long last, to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment, not the yobs, bears full responsibility.	3.6135544243871753
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters.	2.7277218406593646
So, whatever has been stated in this regard, vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive.	2.00055589850789
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.	3.563271348330703
I think we need to retain it.	5.576387464275397
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	3.3305997624111905
Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste.	2.832146333200223
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea, the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value, to wit, ten and one thousand times, respectively.	2.194818363519811
This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future.	3.2366772790965985
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights.	1.9747146784156742
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take good note of this need for coordination, which I have just mentioned, and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, by this Parliament, especially from the point of view of coherence, recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause.	3.4095888344098557
Then it is logical to grant discharge, because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned?	2.416387069341246
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	3.224068257944134
Indeed, it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international, public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by.	2.403431473714881
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent.	1.8279375810945115
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.	2.497240676591905
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million.	2.87505947015884
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	2.6292673232521877
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics.	3.3813470263715186
What concrete measures have been discussed?	2.813028053992995
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	3.931668923364654
The next item is the report (A5-0020/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on a draft Framework Decision of the Council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C5-0332/1999 - 1999/0821(CNS)).	2.130231187174337
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes.	4.019694740568019
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	2.5354233200169616
There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.	2.2563095559627553
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed.	1.8911895604375693
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi, Vice-President Kinnock, Mr Reding and myself.	1.8395575662313242
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful.	2.003899566770667
The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	1.7601628613459108
The debate on the Stability Pact, the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending.	3.8017631056633148
They ask us where their children are, their sons.	1.5423753248317245
The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is.	2.122489278908933
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity.	1.870110809760943
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource.	2.13301144601442
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure.	2.5044337771090364
Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace.	3.8820513638824177
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work.	2.6238016369092425
After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies.	3.4336195141233734
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect.	2.8236151154077973
Second, there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism.	3.3489842052571657
Mr President, it has already been said that, after a war which engulfed the country in misery, Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions.	3.612034714844587
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House.	3.6319308102994157
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	2.5661850193080737
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.	2.754162174724729
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate?	2.4650827351577558
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems.	2.1729272143270775
We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them.	2.540393179391491
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	3.0390240928673165
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values.	2.4673663529008536
For example, the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne, in France, have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today.	3.2767813840174203
The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities.	2.40995843616373
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries.	2.9299484988572386
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model.	2.4529342495257245
My question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate intake of good quality alcohol such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the Swedish budget.	1.9887245899893213
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view.	3.005588364125052
Wrongly done, the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality.	2.36117642663463
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	3.0021929317339544
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament, and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance, can be solved.	3.9439243946704696
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations.	3.986848532144955
Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage.	2.8030635956742307
First OSPAR.	411.0140801047986
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	2.912640376746471
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	2.7298682083874084
One should, however, be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy, the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere, in other words, they are often the people which the company in question needs.	2.4185802716941813
We should, above all, not lose sight of this. The impetus given to the European idea by this programme is having an enormous impact, especially on small linguistic areas such as the Netherlands which not only has national potential, but is also relying on support from the programme, mainly from a language point of view.	2.742373181416481
Mr President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, as set by the Helsinki Council, i.e. focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged Europe, must be adhered to.	3.402463363962078
.	77.3301660757284
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.	1.618388400770919
We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.679020870659441
We therefore assume, Commissioner Byrne, that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base.	2.477016283039264
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women.	3.0489484793374144
However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing.	3.692461198729024
The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff.	2.7648731972316933
In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail.	2.007647000389329
It is, of course, only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry.	3.815341545521726
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public.	2.8633237826215474
For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990.	2.8466673146754027
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry.	2.036917335233668
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	3.871643074090605
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN' s resolutions and, in exchange for peace and security, hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967?	2.526951396521976
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement.	2.6304317642677897
This is what enables them to understand what is going on.	2.6051834247140664
I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights.	3.3998845118352987
You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.	3.00538642260606
We should also recognise that, in Europe, our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one.	3.461811383525223
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme.	3.200175896519927
The New York stage is different from Geneva.	1.8401668047409272
An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries.	2.937485641261621
How is it envisaged that the EU' s institutions, which are already stretched well beyond their capacity, can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition?	2.357981308129948
Moreover, the concept of 'author' is not defined in the Treaties.	3.7080954654789497
(PT) The Commission intends to use the Community initiative EQUAL to replace the Community EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT initiatives and various subprogrammes in these areas, such as NOW, on new opportunities for women, HORIZON, for disabled persons, YOUTHSTART, for promoting the labour market integration of young people, and INTEGRA, for groups threatened with exclusion. Unfortunately, this involves a significant reduction in appropriations.	2.3750401425357466
These are the same areas, Commissioner, which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts, without any control whatsoever.	3.337997374276564
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners.	3.377140181560556
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	2.6894882664888518
Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security.	2.604331875937394
Finally, I want to say that I attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges, emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but, at the same time, be set a target, namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero.	2.6607549078668273
If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom.	2.2498350536229603
Everything else is wishful thinking.	1.6074692619436382
I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy.	2.3528126925874906
All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity, democracy and the rule of law.	2.537036550347818
I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance.	3.9198896339616267
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned.	2.176183959737658
Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe.	3.0153371175651418
We should not overlook this fact: postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels.	2.5217670372397705
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation.	2.490496877742059
The treaties have been revised, new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission, and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union, in our continent and in the world.	3.3555968242717054
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out.	2.113754479324878
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action.	3.8048177817886604
If you charge this from day one, you can process the old cars straight away.	1.7781340555692482
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event.	2.4868282620371938
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	3.0824420520173406
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion.	3.049577380705769
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections, these documents must be available, and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation.	3.094230481931757
For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest.	2.532416296877935
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe.	3.149225236558107
I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union.	3.613006442049813
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this.	4.692210972769795
The report that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula, taking up many of the amendments we have presented, still leaves room for a certain confusion, in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated.	2.8842329078428857
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	3.0368301601858074
It is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different Member States, such as specific climatic conditions, water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of applying standards, and also of the failure to do so.	2.964478971675633
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively.	3.980752948783735
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the "them and us" syndrome.	2.428884867162654
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	1.9085560231143328
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	3.5842694835490616
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era.	2.0596554072049265
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.	3.2734283342522112
EQUAL remains crucial also to regions like my own, in the east of England, outside the principal funds of Objective I. We have had an extra incentive to take up Community initiative funding and an excellent record in response.	2.543033302607685
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	1.7331525574857658
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.	1.6822845182052941
We can take action against this; it is possible.	3.852020254687295
The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy.	5.3582611932157995
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect.	3.194735104373159
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector.	2.6692977293388593
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	3.265251000739713
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence.	2.114832019644761
Madam President, I would simply like to point out that during the procedure, we were not allowed either to table or, consequently, adopt amendments in the Committee.	3.1025866023989597
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.	2.2385840587570414
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you.	2.512890428345546
Why not?	2265.4179776959077
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come.	3.275936747697534
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	3.4804900149269304
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing.	3.0229831400741065
We do need to rethink many aspects of current Community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success. We also need 'distinctive strategic partnerships' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace.	2.633682173136146
For four days, the immigrants were collectively hounded.	1.7634418122939142
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully.	4.429392042395175
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end?	2.501994714977201
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care.	2.828823465146765
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole.	2.2336217864442798
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference.	2.742152663958209
It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime.	2.6519057646591877
In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property.	2.378685065891908
Parliament cannot change these details.	1.426052234592951
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference.	4.160920089868351
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer.	3.927061528998315
Thank you very much.	4.621811099361165
Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year.	3.5646174793925534
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services.	2.828599621195239
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	3.4461641907123663
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	2.6006116902210024
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	2.437662865079403
Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	3.379383080922405
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	3.4859488572327804
LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment;	4.022903441541403
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all.	3.1352762566054913
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those.	1.599913392248608
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	2.268401471876804
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	3.345880022620237
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation.	6.80382168614756
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down.	2.138461997563153
By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider' s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a "Europe of shopkeepers" .	2.8532365415619796
On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more.	2.326660673442407
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council.	5.25235823946706
I understand your concern about the rights of children.	3.388840217319261
Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer?	2.1445242852062085
The situation there is totally unacceptable.	2.0365820979462845
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	1.8181474250022869
Thirdly, to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite.	2.5479884964581023
The second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in Romania must feature in today' s discussions and also more generally when we ponder the environmental dimension of Union enlargement.	2.6527285955313835
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers!	1.971245340594294
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes.	3.0084775014679916
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	2.2911165012716217
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans.	3.177079202003214
Mr President, a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service.	3.995905658401912
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	2.587059614742576
I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area.	2.5496591373767017
No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals.	2.5876826550700187
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	2.9406017761286054
On the subject of human rights, I have received two proposals for additions: one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for an item entitled 'Cambodia' and the other from the Group of the Greens, for an item entitled 'Pinochet' .	3.0236610327324827
Mr Theonas, I can only repeat what I said to Mr Alavanos.	3.9853201350435947
Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee?	3.8778740054537684
This was stupid of the old Commission, and Parliament was of no help on that occasion.	2.625043101730376
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others.	1.7928916364665868
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	2.275320825122589
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential.	3.6517003605775438
We think that the role of food safety, specifically in terms of everything linked to public health, is one of our presidency' s essential tasks. It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme.	4.082066846641958
To avoid this the European Liberal Democrats have expressed the hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric Union, in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring.	2.750297833136702
There is a willingness but fear pervades, and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union.	2.8978335754691797
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean.	2.667335005435791
It is shameful!	1.5483144589628284
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind.	3.289516364293906
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	3.816196273680637
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	2.4018986468653134
In this connection, I would ask Parliament to support Amendment No 108, in which the words "water pollution caused by individual pollutants" are replaced by "prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges" .	2.5126199567740435
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	3.5149597195687536
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee.	2.4860299815555873
Equally, the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process, to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified.	2.793601947938104
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future.	2.8862078166950385
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested, only EUR 784 million have been granted.	2.5755239506984626
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies.	3.2420769665001887
Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic.	2.605833590924495
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	3.1384814851663276
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	2.434306937842865
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	3.0796737108190584
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today.	2.606621741289375
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for your question.	3.5791227139631556
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	3.0919452975247514
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support.	2.2670170660935116
In the age of globalisation, which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man.	2.7883757882340396
I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently.	4.492614392832309
It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments.	2.3313817656072198
B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.0748037114600093
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful.	4.477310052939356
Mr President of the Commission, allow me to close with these words: as the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, we have every interest in a strong Commission.	3.193710862636477
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	3.158591135400881
It sets environmental parameters close to zero.	1.7944160176304857
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process.	3.385879577101154
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are very uneasy about replying to you because, in our view, you are responsible for an area that does not really exist.	4.6693677529980615
Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.	4.052632909882644
It will not be tolerated, and must stop immediately.	3.334585386281261
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day.	2.456091479638859
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	3.310821557332768
As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports.	2.871485888748857
Today, we have arrived at the end of a long road.	4.281752157013713
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.	2.651074133049917
We must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists, that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at Community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all Member States and indeed maybe even beyond, where experts are to be found elsewhere.	2.8291006953951805
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance.	3.3031201783656905
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services.	1.973828464524026
In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements.	2.804134049993372
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests.	2.680514786931963
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	2.7316098357592016
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues.	2.5637722999727566
Mr President, this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs.	4.306506835096687
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	2.0155833795386235
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	3.0864561933291403
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.	2.607053381412922
In order to do so, the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament, associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society.	3.1961033755513077
Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources.	2.186461066724019
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment.	2.983175652039513
What is important, however, is that they have begun.	6.0322926501764496
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda.	2.8370479465202423
Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them.	1.773881794198668
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments.	3.3695611104386347
In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present.	3.6959783498032177
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago, the difference between then and now is like that between night and day, despite difficulties and delays.	2.139541655380384
I can speak for my party, which championed Austria' s membership of the European Union in the early days.	2.663931784305462
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies.	2.9803220516837254
Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed.	2.471612914920819
Those structural problems which make unemployment higher in Europe than in the United States will become even greater.	2.2317885593101336
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences, i.e. increasing unemployment, exclusion and delinquency.	2.080090069622378
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision.	2.3737110603170093
We agree that we should have better control of the finances.	4.250964923617723
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	3.1938861130781904
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission.	3.6218099043917586
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.	4.629788440727333
I am counting on the Commission, and specifically on you, Commissioner, to allocate adequate resources for effective action.	3.526643936135631
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	1.7068180109864555
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency, with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA-ECOFIN Council.	2.6053889381503774
Subject: Commission's plans for presentation of a new social action programme It is important that the Commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme, setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the 'social dialogue'.	2.91540661835911
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).	3.7373437396785576
Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission.	3.4711266588605683
Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	3.491273568250025
In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid.	4.4529235336538155
On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did.	2.1750732199093834
That is lacking in this new system, or at least is only there in embryonic form.	2.2063635668300954
Now, the Union can certainly call the body an 'action force' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men, weapons and logistics.	2.9914357232858872
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself.	2.0485664178275425
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials, the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system.	2.905294585064924
We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage.	2.341173009325385
We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations.	3.0783468920239736
Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring.	2.946595813631729
Six, to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis.	2.831873459987596
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community.	4.521524631593203
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	2.1765145194765143
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	3.051976986038427
But what we need is the analytical resources: these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital.	1.923356226567809
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	2.2868674127706914
Members of this House will have differing views, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) which country they come from or (b) which committee they sit on.	2.4410035088401143
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission	1.6700871076213035
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	2.7521897675337983
In addition, we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions, which may be used for any purposes whatsoever. It is therefore ...	4.589172592669923
Needless to say, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why.	3.5714408717355473
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	2.5826597381114538
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech.	2.51319768976069
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	2.850208967734842
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.)	2.096496676576196
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	3.2583169240964422
The next item is Question Time (B5-0009/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.321295400178665
In order to compensate for this situation, the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us.	3.8961632293388675
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	2.225765925082049
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia, for that matter.	3.7313967984465197
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	4.769645351731892
Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not.	3.572277371908347
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe' s tourism and, to the extent of the possible, safeguard the operation of companies.	3.7086942225795254
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that.	2.4551686699443547
Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water.	2.4428936128732053
Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique.	2.668693179870883
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time.	2.641625351076602
Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises.	2.218617745461237
With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	3.1075141042951064
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	5.621967742228625
I attach great importance, ladies and gentlemen, in a spirit of discipline and transparency, to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information, and not to propaganda, and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the Union.	2.9545890510842674
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens.	2.0839022536795433
I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate.	2.944481590152249
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux, consultation and control, and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place.	2.4531044649665863
Conditions are ripe.	1.224018089996612
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.	3.429463212709108
Yesterday, we also discussed the Commission, represented by Commissioner Barnier, who gave its opinion.	3.160124314271418
The real aims of LEADER + are the same as those of LEADERs 1 and 2, in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the CAP to be implemented in the context of Agenda 2000 and the WTO.	2.8971789519646465
Mr President, we should like to request that the last sentence of Amendment No 2 which reads: 'also calls on the Member States to promote tourism for the elderly' be incorporated into Paragraph 25, which deals specifically with social tourism, after: 'tourism for organised social groups...'.	3.120614594896905
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes.	3.3671425756096918
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on.	3.714050920573064
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied.	1.4724699585617174
In relation to grants and subsidies: yes, consideration has been given to that issue.	2.602669377605153
The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire.	1.9983843641959065
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature.	3.8893928988637323
Mr President, rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area, and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible, Commissioner Fischler.	4.019590326440765
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996.	3.4621981431823174

Not even Mr Sichrovsky' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that.	2.269297054766727
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	3.430687446317419
Protection of juvenile marine organisms	1.2729318518967403
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political, and has no basis or technical viability.	2.512047990713103
Mr President, my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide Parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster, affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment.	3.431827321757617
On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last.	3.524513857471845
Not that I want to put it off, but it would be a gesture, as it were, if you could say: here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test.	3.699174704354826
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view.	4.9496114992691815
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and, not least, to our descendants.	2.2896356418620996
We have thrown water a life-belt.	1.4886958152430139
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again, which can quite easily be done with the aid money.	3.0915327987997467
Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota?	2.4453609354911316
Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews.	3.074900041606949
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	2.7501116516020923
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years' time.	3.065153491748932
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission.	3.074817537786726
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	4.759493549125767
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety, public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission's work programme for 2000.	4.16818793206801

The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
At the same time, however, we shut our eyes to the Union' s own problems: to the violence, inequality, and fourth world reality, which is part of everyday life in the EU.	3.1013502135718483
This revised Community framework would have three core elements: operational criteria set up at Community level, Community control guidelines, and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control.	2.0478423792066494
Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading.	3.3719495632613667
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants.	2.609522770666977
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.	3.0421853591430694
As far as criminal investigations are concerned, for which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis, having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts.	3.07041289589922
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories.	2.650512206215858
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there remains, however, one immediate problem: the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted, many of whose lives are in danger, in their flooded villages, hoping that they will be rescued.	2.9641862530109764
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa, Schengen, Eurodac etc. Any democrat can spot two key problems.	2.3462859277514725
For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one.	2.5319903139581306
(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)	4.867589304526621
Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe.	3.583322053342485
Madam President, this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time.	3.6528814647328383
Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it.	3.7501233784008607
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	2.716477981587759
Collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital. In this respect, the action plans approved by the High Level Group and the Tampere European Council must be allocated a budget.	3.3377614863152916
But there are some who bear even more responsibility than the thugs who wielded the iron bars and knives: those who spread racist and xenophobic slander, those who indulge in anti-immigration demagoguery in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, sometimes even here in this House, are no better than those who take this stupid, reactionary demagoguery at face value.	2.3279108482381057
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities?	2.353577981393924
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime.	1.9468099979220828
This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future.	1.8444706850967774
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters.	2.0443526045385627
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these.	2.9223222017198847
Indeed, we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations.	2.302761176204204
. (DE) Mr Cohn-Bendit, I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country' s domestic politics, in the way that you are doing.	3.241036444332903
But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge.	1.9169607535499689
This is not only necessary for proper public administration, it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen.	4.135148072849605
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all.	2.3506465248306356
To me, this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle.	2.9658718088683096
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change.	3.796154880941677
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission.	3.42501553002704
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation.	2.084523114879483
That is my judgement at the moment.	2.934890201521581
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact, the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence.	2.408445813102985
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved.	2.8037735028655604
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.	1.9739623274872327
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication, Mr Prodi, but which is unfortunately not there.	3.5164946464104947
As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty.	5.118555127826043
Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version.	2.9651009211447494
The correct speculative approach, it seems to me, is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos, rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets.	2.4995780798935217
The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities, thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries, regions and local communities.	1.933230837497589
European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them.	2.199410502275803
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us.	4.396881936632343
These proposals favour women especially.	1.3302397445928629
However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament.	3.537580214625929
The first is the MPLA, which controls the oil profits. The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi, which controls the diamond profits.	1.9848087257228504
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur?	2.246617980592907
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998.	2.184602212303652
We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing.	3.5887282469340422
Yet this is not the situation.	5.761898484370529
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	1.7449743546769567
The next item is the report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	1.7881883001934988
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree.	3.6633177315917744
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.4371500606954688
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.	3.013775903404743
Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents.	2.107500662902701
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament.	2.1251828304514664
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared.	2.840892224453428
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment, ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening.	2.817916179272048
Responsible citizens should, in my view, have a choice.	3.4115659268268295
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy.	3.5393664932997293
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke' s question on this issue.	2.274667751896683
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area, common airspace, a common rail area and a single market, but not a common maritime area. I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms.	2.917638981092991
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth.	2.388269392038995
The next item is the report (A5­0030/2000) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission: 'Enhancing tourism' s potential for employment - follow-up to the conclusions and recommendations of the High Level Group on Tourism and Employment' [COM(1999)0205 - C5-0112/1999 - 1999/2115(COS)].	2.1673308139650427
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission.	3.9528145754884676
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	2.424374610026957
The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to?	2.620681899199203
In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	2.0447612403019604
In view of the fact that no Council representative is able to attend on Wednesday evening, a number of groups - the Group of the European People' s Party, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left - requested that the Council statement on the Cyprus question and Mr Brok' s report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus Mr Swoboda' s report were brought forward in the agenda.	2.4737114476185216
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer.	2.649660559998886
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs.	2.1339259739450998
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions.	1.6322389457651685
And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties?	3.0808214022693665
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs.	2.928588104267464
However, the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission' s proposal.	3.0022752061018383
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council, who is not exactly a stranger to you, how this presumed lack of coherence has come about.	2.8621826993757202
However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these.	2.746253815408417
In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs.	2.771682495215803
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria!	3.4955331806754244
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	2.604293246227728
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	2.325915797942542
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach.	3.8027536221887326
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	2.800955477995157
In itself, globalisation is positive.	3.544420869424298
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States.	2.760917479603745
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works.	1.953809334208686
However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee.	2.763936088455867
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations, it is based on the hope of rain in the next season.	2.982139777222161
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies.	2.5406960153011133
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	2.9703882779851267
Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same.	2.0709339899500945
You may answer the question.	1.6699042725740307
My second criticism follows on from the first.	2.5570198441989667
This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far.	2.650359318285149
Firstly, there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players, by which I mean donors, requiring greater coordination, greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems.	2.1469577970897387
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all?	3.2055185337018828
It is true, I admit it, and you are well aware of the reasons, ladies and gentlemen.	4.1195563191286
Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc.	2.664175916878576
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job.	2.1592452577297614
We all, throughout the European institutions - in Parliament, the Council and the Commission - should be doing our best to aid Cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years.	3.0077365761879764
We wish to see its competences extended, especially within Chapter IV of the Treaty of the European Community and with regard to Chapter VI of the Treaty on European Union and also a review of certain possible options, certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens.	3.215238661244968
I saw some of Mr Kinnock's papers today, I heard some of what he had to say.	2.2229265634719155
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully.	3.265281248768925
We are talking about us, not Austria.	2.8246609582360107
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.	1.776273328771963
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them.	2.117253731383122
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency.	4.48634194372082
In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations.	3.0277141341364238
The common position stipulates 2006.	4.71842023353148
That concludes the explanations of vote.	2.227632761972655
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area.	3.4634876190628163
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	1.609166397335685
I would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done; I would just like to add one small point: in addition to adaptation to ESA 95, there are two small technical changes which Mr Knörr knows all about, relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency.	2.684955155990312
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	1.9389714001930085
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible.	2.4346728747963384
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met.	3.2057698318775105
If we assume that, on average, a car has a life of eleven years, do Members, indeed does anyone, believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem?	2.200895347326391
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed, in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups, to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level, supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance.	2.3847413612625625
However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement.	4.044117163642505
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated.	2.715951977865851
This cannot be ignored or evaded, certainly not on account of soft law, as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee.	2.5119235188076656
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	2.235521051282902
Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future.	2.9267689865614295
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance.	2.4165847876313027
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves.	2.486684181053726
From the Commission' s point of view, our conclusion is that this is a good agreement, and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni.	4.198573498499073
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals?	2.4551760315656743
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code.	3.446545848456916
And just as well, in my view.	4.491681875665437
Secondly, we send our deepest condolences to their families, their socialist colleagues, the Basque parliament and the Basque police force. We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy.	2.5274027472356058
They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc.	1.9324766270372788
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.	2.1560715619574964
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	2.220036368016256
It must be rid of some of its more outdated elements; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why European civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a Europe of open borders, or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of Member States.	2.620428619211701
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.	3.1158268115315866
There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties.	3.044897842891388
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn.	2.128818783034439
There are alarming reports of human rights violations.	2.4707216633795364
From what I have said, it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer.	3.9273663614894
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked.	3.072807298221861
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity.	5.35475250620495
Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court.	2.1737817331680853
I look forward to working with this Parliament, with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples.	4.570714727904386
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future.	3.0687249513113435
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.	3.5739634019056554
This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example.	2.779803090177246
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation.	3.196143648830014
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	2.32634665352286
I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries.	2.519628350094099
But, Mr Marinos, in the EU context, culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas.	3.188712269874387
There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources.	2.703223792129887
Rezala should never have been in France. He arrived from Algeria at a time when, according to the authorities, immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come.	2.6252805493075355
They are political because we are moving on.	2.750648940439358
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity.	3.617193308918153
It has not, however, been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle.	3.0736597694052663
We, Euskal Herritarrok, are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda.	2.2260020993539804
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States.	2.55438907973588
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget.	1.833410672694048
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia.	3.4137546085098376
Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message.	3.007585500150647
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers.	2.64196471808089
This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.	6.277403664782355
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	1.7175964989582793
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason.	1.9503164399737574
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	3.175685256108679
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September.	2.2615118447241027
Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.	4.531692919683266
Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe.	4.089997153227509
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	1.8310457439583394
I will keep myself free in this connection.	1.9949034289451697
At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way.	3.6605269223757295
Madam President, I am pleased about the fact that, in Austria, the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes, in my eyes, a huge victory for democracy.	3.6555008112822978
(SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	2.2685482440989673
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty.	2.7587703311122524
I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this.	3.423034604010872
We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars.	3.8566221997849865
Mr President, the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people, it is the generalisation of insecurity, of low wages, of deteriorating working conditions.	4.019975466206705
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	3.6228428966807074
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations.	2.043522226995605
The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough.	2.8560177250483023
As a sign of our political commitment, we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects.	2.4236690759591384
It should be put on record, and I want to put it on record today.	4.671105014814706
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	2.019508872013936
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism, so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age.	3.2883808887158503
Two important questions have arisen in this regard. Yes, there are in fact more than two questions, but I want to mention just two of the most important.	3.6272156076180595
However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security.	2.9810272807936187
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change.	2.7524292852301624
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love.	2.955909734870304
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government.	1.9394577993377637
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done.	2.713135638438307
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	6.574306950180702
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.	2.3975131636223175
If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.	3.1001873769441803
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period.	2.7942753056717855
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC.	2.4991925202533882
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda, there are already four items.	4.919705813003656
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	3.1036521039230456
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	3.481835386083896
The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities.	1.6980785632543154
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough: we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors, for example.	3.0829743169132655
We need to cooperate with the Council too.	8.237515900733829
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those who work on rural areas know that, of the programmes which the European Union has managed, the LEADER programme, both LEADER I and LEADER II, is one of its success stories, and I hope that the same will be true of LEADER+.	3.469008862225406
Of course, we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content, but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam, and even extending them.	2.9042594636278722
The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all.	2.9967517906501495
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	2.938556376364167
Brok report (A5-0029/2000)	1.286633953337484
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003.	3.3118168549322533
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden.	2.2197661427601503
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative, as appears from your contributions this afternoon, to formulate a single text.	2.2234159341479183
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles, as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market.	2.356134338978947
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	2.02666295558185
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards.	1.5369942256919398
I think that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide, socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly.	3.5231146825345365
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents, pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	2.513641490169345
The people of Europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit, but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible.	2.9388725024910505
The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field.	2.309230076657156
Sixthly and finally, we reaffirm that ETA' s terrorism and violence must end. ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion.	2.219605364739157
It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied.	2.944958321357356
This is a pity, in a sense.	7.852537647031485
I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines.	4.206426803089089
Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive.	2.811598985811542
He has done really good work in a very short time.	3.2868517522962177
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies.	2.338839518882337
The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes.	2.9567606888203755
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	5.758799844504899
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	2.2887724495501467
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	3.1200499212507
As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us.	2.171913129048799
The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia.	3.5614054551541887
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	2.084550590721985
However, I do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all Member States have approved Commissioner Monti' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital.	3.913000189010261
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand.	2.5847694734348527
Surely we should be more selective.	5.568456260794808
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	4.49090132914967
On the subject of these two initiatives, then, with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives, let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the European Parliament and its committees.	2.910976221744226
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	2.7030813379162413
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality.	2.110203298416736
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	4.431158431983979
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that.	1.7592093321980125
Yes, I am in favour of such a tax, but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow.	5.196492932494807
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous.	2.477365690222292
The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity.	2.6948165217957425
Mr President, I just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the House also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the Austrian anti-racist associations who are honouring us with a visit.	2.9273559092234653
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union.	3.398235550703053
What it says it that one of two things may apply, i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector.	2.5380197872693695
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	1.9780029494328402
It has been used by the Community for some time now in a range of policy areas, environmental, human, animal and plant health; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the EC Treaty since Maastricht.	3.1764108454907314
But, you are right, we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem.	4.928182332210356
I would like to comment on two things. Firstly, vintage cars and motorbikes.	2.9581557282229616
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole.	2.966549808537737
It is, meanwhile, very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, on central matters of common interest, notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations.	2.9106095955184332
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	3.8940663590183404
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats.	2.016572388577377
This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	2.0203912568963682
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	3.1484300703302512
Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment.	4.76924009344221
Thirdly, I should like to address the question of the timetable.	5.052237233018232
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety, Mr Byrne.	2.476117166994832
The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished.	2.450935874816629
The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas.	2.8669526009298734
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply.	3.9256502803347555
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention.	5.048506960755071
That concludes Questions to the Commission.	2.152534158770815
Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban.	3.32002525665999
In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies.	2.8518943154622916
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise.	2.663437519763022
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	1.9245413149058044
If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July.	3.0553166043076225
We should, of course, not get overly excited about it.	2.9641035619434914
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission.	3.1408489184264647
For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action.	4.131175805478695
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	3.766460222268815
These feeder funds exist in the United States, which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system.	3.2171109827493254
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Council Presidency' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness.	2.5422454153521583
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted.	3.3764015185624614
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation.	5.636588639300933
We would, on the other hand, like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber.	3.3181852961612126
Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy.	3.292403957891513
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.	3.398932630549
That is also mentioned in the report.	2.8401994853255306
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	3.7958311341780773
Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise.	2.3033945905232907
I do not think so.	4.9501349135169335
We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner.	3.1273393889664702
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	2.7164636888755185
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.	2.877550070613241
The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts.	4.363152106596044
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	1.841509139636748
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts, to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements.	2.8794368630613563
Yet a worrying situation is apparent.	1.551511529783694
This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms.	2.4337117333252345
We are aware that it is a delicate debate.	5.780759246999601
Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III.	3.597826388550609
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	2.7520021054268504
The insertion of Article 13, which was referred to during the debate, dealing with non-discrimination in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the Treaties.	3.2485443975794928
Finally, I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community' s environmental policy.	3.9877039285402867
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition.	2.267064710114998
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum, we are not just talking about it; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general, an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper, so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration, not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too.	2.733021814119084
However, in moving forward, what should we be financing?	2.5317950558307865
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored?	1.9167848064343933
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	3.439212681644933
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission's Green Paper on food law was published.	2.7797703307022705
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive.	2.8687299733278886
I should just like to say, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that if I am not here when the Commission responds - not that I have asked any specific questions, but I should nonetheless hope that the Commission has been paying attention - then that is because the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision-making process at the same time as the present debate is going on.	3.1615797352898216
Much remains to be done, however, and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe.	3.986097869494672
I am glad to see that the Commission and Parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area.	3.0474456611278287
In the case of a non-Schengen state, in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22, that possibility is contemplated, and is perfectly expressed, and I believe this provides greater legal security.	3.8458060927276163
Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance.	1.8354331702737001
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002, but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect.	2.3703842954150365
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and/or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost.	2.261203766493148
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament.	3.2790772514411177
It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' .	3.770199807314846
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment.	2.778553364542554
We are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery, which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies.	2.6302195460114066
Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level.	2.703966475367338
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation.	4.122248854088525
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources.	2.4879132729648665
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards.	2.615107136230595
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies.	1.488588508667133
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment?	2.51691416120818
. Mr President, I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely combating TSEs.	3.7389719793051936
However, the main concern remains ...	6.7120058075463795
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	3.052430122410079
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	2.8544832276754244
Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality.	3.0914034847763525
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	3.0735884165602307
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution.	2.683390257224229
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels.	2.7223328503758246
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information.	2.437386348551715
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty?	2.8881819432464635
From now on, the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called CIRCA, to which the European Parliament will have access. This represents a real innovation, not only for us, but also - I am sure - for the Commission.	4.068395832004087
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules.	2.5730603811974366
Numerous questions are still outstanding.	1.5738462919618748
As a political force, we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values.	2.8659446818505607
Finally, among the priority parameters to be introduced at European level to enable local involvement, particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by LAGs within the LEADER II initiative, but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified.	2.3332697634621358
If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order.	3.2010987008166247
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process.	3.724766737190744
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue.	2.1737241351205565
It is clear that a radical overhaul of the Commission is long overdue.	4.0994545144978485
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	3.970078326212132
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands.	2.7625817381153897
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy which your Commission could pass on to the European Union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the Commission, and perhaps of the Union itself.	3.418427790868594
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	3.7488240654883307
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.	3.279707571815332
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	3.185743561751226
The supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the Dublin Conventions and Schengen Agreements and a further action plan from Tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants.	2.1053850774044793
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry, EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law.	3.047467292525743
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	6.9743779359294225
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0136/2000) by Mr Queiro, Mrs Muscardini and Mr Berthu, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	3.8757918991300824
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible.	2.835092822555467
However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role.	3.277402736636802
Mr President, before I came here for today' s sitting, I was watching Finnish television.	3.4354571135984466
My final point is this.	2.466034060782114
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin.	2.415771501836375
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission, I must tell you that I have received, pursuant to Rule 37, seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.	3.1830459204896973
Let us make ourselves heard!	1.7807762623016026
We also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium-sized undertakings and, of course, about refusing to use outside service providers.	2.6584255262982155
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools.	2.5402801497170917
I would urge Parliament to support them.	3.1468037610430883
Could the Commission say whether the Greek Government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment, and what these commitments are? Has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing, recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment, or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work?	2.424361312370959
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary.	2.089725313874404
And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the "contre-filet" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned.	2.6156404341748956
Adjournment of the session	1.4992999455679814
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	2.9960490206633192
We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed.	2.953826529222303
This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level.	2.723701891800631
They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used.	3.220885205898527
Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of "big brother" and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods.	2.2842303622206135
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	4.713634109666314
This is a key priority for us to focus on.	6.162212377047851
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims.	2.1982376926676337
But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage.	2.864803232357899
As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	2.7366733767936573
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas.	2.146706427935584
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate?	2.2782416566267334
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU.	2.829863981652863
In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia.	3.181359307748137
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	2.454452119324081
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe, which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods.	2.7550880464991843
These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets.	3.177853723375405
This is something I would stress, particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States.	3.4784001485210974
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives, and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission' s proposal.	2.8471566085241915
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution.	2.5417705642612534
Illegal state aid, by contrast, destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment.	2.1248336550887017
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	3.0381664539038438
I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it.	2.4944403018555064
Proposal for a joint resolution on human rights	4.078046685825727
Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation.	2.0983329136690405
It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously.	2.816004278809336
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities, non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces.	2.7644138440742774
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one.	2.380258023757662
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses.	2.503200053107374
That is the one word I am talking about.	3.926692338535625
It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds.	3.0407026322851163
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners.	3.685097995490266
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	2.9355640003438737
This service must therefore be kept public.	2.8201651855831367
Helsinki was an historic event, an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point.	1.6688794826342668
We all, I believe, agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions.	2.37662519281994
I emphasise the word 'could' , and that is if it is done well and with care.	3.5449978861086953
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! "I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999".	2.807352595285213
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	2.284413123493117
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020.	3.60036186171537
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	2.459991295829501
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz.	2.7414247042406394
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade, including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade.	2.4673831093693552
Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	3.269026550701397
Madam President, may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and, above all of course, Mr Désir, for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening.	4.011777212766819
Kosovo Albanians and Serb deserters are being refused refugee status, whereas Pinochet is calmly escaping prosecution.	1.5232684151055271
We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end.	2.1891313246666178
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	4.691907354530015
Mr President, Mrs Attwooll' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States. This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002.	3.4688815869367624
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions.	2.4837684196111507
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is.	2.8383231890287677
We do not think that the new Commission, under any circumstances, could incur liability for the past.	4.1469205945605205
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes.	2.134822741955856
I too, therefore, can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments.	3.648247457426851
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed. We now hope to be able to solve these problems.	2.643826987786738
This Parliament is excluded from this, for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility.	2.990440893874755
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	2.5973585844674316
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions.	2.527411638765986
On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom.	2.763061875216469
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety.	3.4999226903191754
At a time when, Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects, why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient?	2.541512862387724
The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.	2.5084902246722693
I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does.	3.3081672856829543
However, it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80% of the anchovies, which, until 1995, were being fished in the Portuguese fishing grounds, through an agreement between that Member State - Portugal - and France, should now be fished in the Bay of Biscay and that the Council of Ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay or the Cantabrian Sea.	2.73890346303182
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.	4.166265988613744
As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example.	3.0169440429615455
Since 1995, following a concerted international effort between the main donor states, involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the OECD' s Development Assistance Committee, it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies, both at national and international level.	2.6307023403283054
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted.	3.1426115397867154
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session.	1.635004520918482
Society is surrendering itself to the economy.	2.1952667155290735
75%-80% of this is to come from private sources, and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions.	4.068617460486051
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union, and especially within the framework of the Council.	4.128293929939612
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection.	2.4777341875759182
Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.	2.2980357195846275
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site.	3.0304130010398582
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	2.0719624231687717
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ.	2.180212559553342
Madam President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet, despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued.	3.7559265608496903
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition.	2.3171537582671147
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.	1.9539317618713952
They cannot therefore be approved.	1.9926695459778292
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally, it cannot command any authority.	2.5758533193109914
I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing.	3.7221668064627154
I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice.	4.012711676640544
Mr President, it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year: Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.	3.0084943278435206
What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	2.178971598900685
We have listened to the Commission' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation. This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy.	2.4110685622859735
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change.	2.814099739655248
(Parliament adopted the resolution)President.	1.50432477965579
Moreover, I have been informed that the Commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the Commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our Parliament, I hope.	3.6730167434938172
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit.	2.4013846082961745
I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised.	3.5030438861745785
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this, and with good reason, because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction.	3.904695249340832
I believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the Union and I repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence, such as the Carrefours.	3.324678847545593
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	2.989711568662577
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	3.0736874917708343
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.	2.96780229817502
What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?	3.8153744858991705
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	2.586985268551627
You may draw your own conclusions.	1.6274451078319199
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa.	3.0015989524435627
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources, as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases.	2.4309618361194922
We must take action on this at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I firmly hope that this opinion, that was given reluctantly, will not mean that the European Parliament ceases to exert pressure on the Council and the Member States to make sure that this Intergovernmental Conference is not merely a technical exercise, but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in Parliament.	3.9568465906404544
(FR) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation.	2.1309218614661414
. (PT) In response to your question, Mrs McKenna, I would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the Court of Auditors was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.	3.5481443134820516
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	2.841081097460186
Quite the opposite, in an enlarged Europe, Mr President, the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding.	2.9103277457768724
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	2.8054126453138153
To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	2.4289049449225666
In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed.	2.6312575007550425
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	3.2890093940365066
Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report.	2.4395901504660387
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate.	3.376459836634172
It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory.	2.2792584950244206
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.	3.2429907830935245
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune.	2.915999758040451
Furthermore, it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water, between different river basins, practically impossible in the future.	2.648327312292611
If not, then we will proceed to the vote.	2.570232965526998
After five years only four have done so.	2.0142525250994336
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public, a rarity in a European directive.	3.371890272406469
Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health.	2.7426087475388923
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, for the following reasons.	2.2900403125997832
How will BSE status in fact be defined then?	1.790908011727046
I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs.	3.0830226097680233
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	4.317187901085736
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution.	3.8733332872182347
Madam President, I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri.	2.9551706173561576
In this connection, I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds.	2.4336472607916195
But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag.	2.515174319122082
Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000)	1.0820706359717611
For about 10 years, the situation in the area has been fluid.	4.916163657219578
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme, local operators have combined forces, debated and prepared projects.	2.5881931925837782
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme.	2.164162927126636
At the same time, unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.	3.2497878749490345
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	2.80257573865936
The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements.	3.0509364314236
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States	1.4768184364869348
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity.	2.691527451548122
Mr President, may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work.	2.8700462310195602
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business.	1.979567908134476
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found.	2.1738987677016426
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	3.520671819003359
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	2.911054505824649
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	2.279844556802261
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic.	2.49753731274613
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union.	2.618287552847136
I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men.	2.419176263091458
This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions.	4.640699496627633
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region.	3.037439682316853
We therefore have a number of amendments.	5.957237878526898
Di Pietro report (A5-0019/2000)	1.4383966328381406
All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	2.2614068380540955
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.	3.6037327247007114
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	3.1867334727318544
We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament.	2.3266439360307496
Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down.	2.680943484015486
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	2.755754160195874
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry.	3.498268973354103
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	3.6297072150478358
Fifthly, we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which, on their own, cannot bring about the peace which we all desire.	2.6873169401118453
There are also courts in Karlsruhe, London, Lisbon, Dublin and Edinburgh.	2.5247499718618585
The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them.	2.778408202570096
It is easy for individual countries, for individual sectors of industry, to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days.	2.596827880516641
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined.	2.1798210042237383
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	2.6318880060617413
Europe, Japan and the US - the euro, the yen and the dollar, would constitute, in my opinion, such a block.	2.2729362320236954
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	2.0287471608252154
In the end, it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens.	3.3221206610076193
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme.	1.9797872239394396
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do.	3.097736225954212
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	2.4639811210944638
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	2.236011342467966
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	3.500960901009196
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability, entrepreneurship and adaptability.	2.090955661885943
However, the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking.	2.3498771401799954
1997 discharge	888.9447152245349
The other amendments are unacceptable.	2.4695948558883374
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House.	3.03004097558853
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be.	1.9552231333235035
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport.	2.330058322639365
Mr President, the American leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the Indians and other indigenous peoples.	2.5978930203621675
I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo.	3.4345961018791695
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure.	3.18010951532458
Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power.	2.9522217776346524
It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo.	3.0029167787245585
I make no apology for this approach; I firmly believe that it is the correct one.	2.843451534817509
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe.	1.9738140402204691
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective.	2.433785655987108
In this way, a decision-making system can be created that is more effective, clearer, more open and more democratic.	2.5256413138591904
In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences.	3.1286300976234656
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future.	2.584819154763757
Ensure too, that training becomes a management tool.	2.044251851400812
Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault.	2.523528792345743
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged.	2.053279029939607
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services.	2.368041046154458
If certain countries wish to use the words "former Yugoslavia" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them.	2.5096494921556736
And I believe that it is our responsibility, in an ever more rapidly moving economy, where everyone must have a real opportunity, to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise, and a second and a third chance, if necessary.	2.8022615235373456
So what are we to do now?	2.0664687353470628
We expect the Commission to implement it.	3.63890244942127
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market.	3.5858153610141916
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	2.852376826828075
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart.	2.3730047312401954
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
You have made an explicit reference to the CAP for the coming years, but you have not done so for the CFP, with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context, in the context of globalisation.	3.6836341264610044
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	2.9927672185328724
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty.	3.2518210266125336
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	3.2772314717701674
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	2.5082073391084885
After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International.	3.9088838013377774
It cannot create jobs just by government spending.	1.6322295163653255
Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way?	2.8710236839457175
Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking.	2.92897177164336
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation.	3.7939180732918443
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests.	1.5569723720628796
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way.	2.7286382330242214
I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained.	3.0132432633347728
By then, my children will be older than I am now.	1.8805244249858302
Financial control will be absolutely secured, both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes, and because we will introduce a completely professional, independent internal audit service.	2.927210283625495
It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being.	2.631965225976501
We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector.	3.677553310753287
Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on.	2.7366925514620664
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.82628545285382
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and, what is more, desirable.	4.0728581178613465
It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage.	2.283803591298421
As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind.	2.4257143992166235
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included.	4.068340251962347
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date, stressing, particularly your rapporteur, the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted.	2.1586382592712137
The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration.	2.7854378561593367
In 1998, we had 55 murders.	3.1092158290364122
However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers.	3.36355721499138
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.	3.136495381551853
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information.	2.6945783144548754
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	2.888748705013482
A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission.	1.9613349645486295
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive.	2.9653867316892724
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions.	2.1291117806847075
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter?	2.425663355478798
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice?	2.7696171921860544
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi.	3.7670155957230875
I am referring to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, the need to involve Serbia in the region' s reconciliation process and - why not? - new discussions on relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I think calls for a change in the existing UN Charter.	3.0977362053019113
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.8384467724761684
My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example?	2.4771546892772593
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to.	2.9636654596900343
My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda.	3.277862369700058
co-president of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly. Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for their statements this morning, but I will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about.	3.470305747331238
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish.	3.3689480714664044
We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU.	2.2079082453076437
This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria' s integration process.	2.7403657646680184
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production.	2.843812769210566
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies.	3.0637715088032813
They must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual, without forgetting, naturally, that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business, to invest and risk, and in an ordered and focused system, entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity.	2.5551028736347297
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen.	3.021716322361443
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.	2.3135202365467653
If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action.	3.0925414319625157
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	3.1716731004603034
As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably.	4.195833774270943
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	3.237214336657437
In my country - I live in the north of Spain -, there is a considerable difference between the north and the south, and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another.	3.1514300795427985
Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients;	2.832339687236154
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system.	1.9488694769369954
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen.	3.1880876527524653
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.	1.9210099729836825
If the Member States decide, in agreement with ourselves, that 25% of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control, then they must also make the necessary personnel available.	3.2023042122394445
.	77.3301660757284
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	1.6250133084230751
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy.	3.819509055276408
We have no problem, Mr Newton Dunn, in repeating this information to you in writing, but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here, because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly.	3.473897283402225
Just as elderly people in cities are very isolated, so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities: they are drawn by the bright lights, and the pubs, and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied.	2.455838244953204
People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved.	2.3611796566909677
The problem for some of us, however, is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity.	3.956567565804259
However, there are six, seven, eight, nine perhaps, subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address.	2.495571538829823
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully.	2.3161817324473777
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation.	2.547571649276171
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences.	2.7448490805393013
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.	4.198497564401287
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still!	2.9672669298115038
A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences.	2.781957108450343
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s.	2.4712964856492023
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper's proposals on the authority.	3.496236438709562
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms.	3.245542220654977
Mr President of the Commission, may I say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure, the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this House today: that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political.	3.382104806785335
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	2.4092088679189207
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group, and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter.	3.7473920913770242
In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally.	3.786603989400852
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service.	3.3684965772192696
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments.	2.234256638467861
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening, that reflects a rapid decline in quality, while at the same time prices are sometimes rising, which is something else we must note.	2.1903655502084063
I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU.	2.145496010619935
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	3.386894071139553
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	3.364655632584598
In particular, we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do (see, for example, paragraph 7).	3.13675425305267
You are a first class European.	2.35909819069535
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries?	2.6276546145895145
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	2.201882183707382
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty.	2.4843985243698077
Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce.	3.277556706401103
My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	2.5690704255666548
I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect.	3.6902802529418657
In addition to incorporating a new methodology, this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations, on account of the aforesaid methodological changes, and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates.	2.478927840301455
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question.	3.1718608755446147
What is needed from the European Commission, the Council and everyone else, is a quiet determination, a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both Cyprus and Malta without guile, granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession, so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about.	3.0900480747400274
However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions.	3.0503933621249297
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process.	2.8906756250268666
Of course, we need double-hulled vessels.	10.073909711166195
Moving on now, then, to the point where there is (or, I hope, was) a lack of agreement, namely OTC derivatives.	3.2909438452902666
Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?	3.0728173330877313
Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work.	2.8992474570868936
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture.	2.0541237506952883
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries.	3.314590973219859
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Representatives of the Commission, it is a black day for Austria and for Europe.	4.437846094474574
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy.	3.7474598242682924
Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward.	3.2594690042073857
Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors.	3.954972507040038
In my opinion, funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions.	3.1258688710960763
Parliament supports this.	2.5081800093987026
Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights.	2.932862307612301
I am referring to the double hull, which consists of two layers of steel, with containers divided into two tanks.	2.0236302623702858
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	3.27086296382146
It is a definite and concrete issue. It is about our common currency.	4.2143045528694225
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.	2.453108198492045
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material.	3.1753323402870595
That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus.	3.8167995512595962
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally.	3.7345901430285595
Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated.	4.321135551465702
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	2.9473100736449984
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.	2.4317997968128844
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	2.795800583288446
However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem.	3.572399213653834
I would like to tell you that, in fact, it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem.	4.64675618520756
On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period.	2.6446924954803896
Following this interview, the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled "Strasbourg Declaration" . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration" .	1.9545317444061259
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace.	3.7776731342637593
We are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the French Presidency, in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000.	3.362592233643923
Subject: High infant mortality levels in Kosovo According to the most recent UN information forwarded to the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe. About 50% of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages.	2.1483511673793374
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules, administrative procedures and management practices.	2.0955748115850485
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	3.068750501930702
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments.	3.627499641025152
Obviously, this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public' s range of savings options.	1.9600537775208708
The two processes are separate processes.	1.549665460560549
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level.	2.666520067887087
Graefe zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000)	2.4399859153229873
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	3.1501142617580205
Perhaps we can discuss this later on.	1.471727536260678
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency.	2.2447459936460104
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing.	1.4258815070680986
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time.	3.1104069097404974
In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following:	4.428789951827852
Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation.	3.0674690754728915
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.	2.4696378404820765
Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty.	6.362056359912786
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region.	3.0962763815857755
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	3.8779562135231003
In human resources policy, the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable.	3.45662880330111
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie, which must be tackled.	2.4118871731144735
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four.	3.8756703832778836
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this.	2.7182945146556383
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000.	3.0688117612795733
However, we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.0336637714135244
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed.	4.397247492975169
In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy.	2.6826981719803475
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work.	2.7225788329823915
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process.	2.11168297356396
Thank you very much, Commissioner Schreyer.	2.286169578801835
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data.	2.8183286745926277
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument.	1.9857908504112705
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level.	2.8820668542373324
I have given you my answer.	2.021863510630537
This is a major task.	10.254690130042396
Therefore, and given that the relationship between the European Union and the Commission and Turkey has now changed, it would be a good idea if Turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of Turkey within the European Union.	3.141460615151169
It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed.	3.7271985080645513
I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water.	2.539617171119438
This is Angola' s reality.	3.338849699298758
What is to be done with this money?	4.836749424499251
The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council.	3.8050448072218
The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired.	3.749279503907816
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation.	2.6784850555898507
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term.	2.982739757016098
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	2.474352262976748
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so.	2.869933607185676
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions.	2.0395502818058566
. (FR) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources.	3.0216040010613194
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3573064339158158
I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors.	2.780329648835788
It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy.	3.7386133570120097
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	4.068961932231144
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.	3.8849301810794934
Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban.	3.6366372663115913
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest.	2.042070672932621
In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States.	3.9897893687197317
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998?	2.057560047152059
I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work.	3.859917962246072
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary.	2.249699037560728
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy.	2.6920802005647038
Brussels knows best.	1.3184031117976378
For example, it has not been defined.	9.49721186657433
But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy.	4.315403923283961
Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.	2.807953757767903
Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result.	2.6220676575639152
Mr President, I want to say that I share the other rapporteurs' delight at the fact that better opportunities are now to be glimpsed for making further progress in Cyprus in the light of the improvement in relations between Turkey and the EU and between Turkey and Greece.	3.37781391310252
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently in second reading in Parliament.	3.24914758444785
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting, this being a measure which we would encourage.	2.705640591120674
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support.	2.4216472331468584
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions, leading inevitably to monopoly situations.	2.0958664741890143
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	3.2981471926972787
It is therefore specified that, through the adoption of a regulation, the Commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation. This will occur at the same time for all the additives in question.	3.0028714201144906
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services.	2.4365413955634003
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control, damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity.	2.8032046829927824
The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.	3.0736295927954513
At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands.	2.740883243359918
On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law.	1.9550265209266657
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	2.4636415346421474
They should be accessible to smaller groups, accessible for them to be able to devise, implement and monitor the programmes.	2.676731411666787
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing.	2.720579934302027
It is an imperative.	7.4182426999004685
Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block.	2.82549541069586
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible.	3.272570223893902
We need to continue to stand up for these rights, especially in our own Member States and societies, but also elsewhere.	4.87227828593185
The investment needs to be visionary.	4.125962794395551
Mr President, rapporteur, restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the European institutions and in European politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us.	4.421211986914309
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.593959791417158
However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws.	4.005489631683802
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then, although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter.	2.6054535594909303
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action.	2.770310456289265
The proposed changes are twofold: the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle.	2.2596872285372296
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility, the characteristic feature of contemporary society.	2.0154499554164493
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us.	2.0653340934651045
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks, whether intentional or unintentional.	3.016380299646043
Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules.	2.6941949393552123
Parliament' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations.	2.034549614764839
We have made a start, and we hope the work will produce some excellent results.	3.414096346952831
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity.	3.503900020552794
Projects should also specifically address this problem.	1.8423176774134913
Clear progress must be visible.	1.3704961531905315
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it.	3.1812356134499717
Parliament is a separate subject.	3.2607185764555013
I have two major concerns, however, about the development partnerships.	4.525389149943457
Mr President, I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM, our national airline company.	3.739665772681154
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	4.230614298781486
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year' s General Assembly, certainly not at the Geneva session.	2.9372075881010775
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land.	2.588249226765389
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	3.1993835483846067
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution.	3.288617484115549
Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction?	2.2404631324823856
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	3.8368778136108195
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested.	2.062486836212494
The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk.	3.3000026206941597
There is no freedom without rules.	4.237925771143472
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities.	2.1018153990077364
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	2.412189015389596
However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences.	2.624214968882095
It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	3.304821238686374
The costs will not disappear. Nor will the waste disappear.	1.6238516273384214
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer.	3.5092180315669603
A long memory will serve us well, ladies and gentlemen.	2.2258448007982343
I want to be very candid: I have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the EU.	3.3540423366472494
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	2.8751865668973746
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and, if necessary, give additional support under URBAN.	4.713504397365659
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives?	2.3547988156431314
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day, culture may not seem that important, but it is; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important.	3.532959152720774
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse.	1.7499948647691825
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	3.9848298619433784
We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself.	2.7459291374166312
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation.	1.8538450746744244
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament. I thank him for that.	2.024113440697271
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts, and the fact that we wish to improve coordination, I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed.	3.746874997093818
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	3.16907504976466
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators.	1.9646251878940422
Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services.	3.459327671308625
Mrs Avilés-Perea, that was an exhortation rather than a question.	3.59843604626783
That is in line with the draft resolution.	4.05180832262553
The real world simply does not work like that.	2.3157810787329436
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres.	2.855687887248429
What message can we send to the fishermen of Europe, and their families, and the fishing industries, both the extractive and processing and marketing industries, and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many European ports, in so many European regions, in most cases peripheral regions, who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority?	2.825182292694409
In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.	2.4232033772683446
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	2.7909220602839984
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.	2.7418720212747143
It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well.	2.499832380669791
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	1.8461634229552386
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	2.9745046732978886
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget.	4.165712817906821
As the presidency has noted, the Union as a whole is considering its position.	3.054604721361456
If you ratify this development, then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States, and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union.	2.871619163702309
I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done.	2.7559851409122142
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	3.3994246471853744
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	3.826388252613106
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent.	2.445809489646575
Both as an historical period and, in particular, as a political period, 10 years is a very long time.	3.6880800292184737
People must realise this!	1.4221298624151553
I believe that, despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island, these points, which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides, may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution.	2.780970870843146
And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow.	3.448748923121636
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.	4.872876586182055
Water is a prerequisite for human life.	3.4871607164945577
Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo.	3.8817115144038303
The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and "national interests" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions.	3.2045439000551745
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief, of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg, for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross.	2.203193175043509
II. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses (COM(1998) 451 - C4-0465/1998 - 1998/0242(COD))	2.1325510318381697
These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe.	2.522021474505966
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters, including preventing conflicts, is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique.	2.7530304142439834
For the Commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take-up of information communication technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence.	2.260116917516126
This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said.	2.042846518447915
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.6634238620972148
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report.	2.4460943095135432
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation, discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced.	2.900637640564662
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively.	3.710760101132444
The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules.	2.9329132517289564
In what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third CSF and what steps will the Commission take to ensure greater participation by the 'partners' in all measures taken under the new CSF?	2.9044852827877268
One of the objections is that, due to the restricted role of the elected bodies, businesses gain more influence.	3.432418664384835
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings	4.100422657417853
However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA.	2.705902944570689
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things.	1.8466320522665427
Students are an obvious example.	1.5782301402049572
Andersson report (A5-0033/2000)	1.0820706359717611
Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly.	3.616048728993181
Unfortunately, the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight.	2.7394114056821968
Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty.	2.7563952929574493
But there is an art to that as well.	3.2634031187502455
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity.	2.1601151681709236
Use of ICT opens a completely new dimension in the context of travel and tourism.	2.8096557544224603
This is key as regards the future of this issue.	4.083957729253366
That is the measure of the problem.	5.543114671864635
If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away.	2.377489835681277
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union' s desire to communitise urban policy.	2.9992523438271945
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	4.0630782549504625
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	1.8246644586800098
Pensions: The document states that, 'Member States must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems' , and yet the Commission itself intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments.	2.402763006987102
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	2.92134267043967
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard.	1.944346722915278
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	2.321849083789004
At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties.	3.355046535741715
Bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade, as highlighted by Mr Koch, does Commissioner Liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the Community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy, given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment?	3.026851145246539
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population.	2.189883444288968
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis?	2.2754405430787203
Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation.	5.446862543326184
That is my first question.	5.604311153167071
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.4090652235943488
Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently.	3.526111195529104
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses, because they managed to recycle certain materials, even materials which are not yet included in the directive.	2.5576790386281374
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration.	2.1517518499279293
Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday.	3.44938543185487
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	2.5757353181104943
However, responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers.	1.930768720075774
Mr President, there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security, freedom and justice.	4.553463095452167
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly.	2.810048579482525
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code.	2.3009496665017313
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement, or at the Balkans.	1.9815819509445258
We can therefore welcome its adoption.	2.0366834932759406
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests.	2.1383878625952843
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	3.00431560265999
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers.	2.0449164786357725
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations.	2.6983733989185774
However, unlike Mr Christopher Huhne, we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may, in time, provoke the same type of crisis.	1.8028158356675004
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.	3.244751658984365
If they yield, they are lost.	2.7695751622766105
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	1.999461774542824
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level.	3.180880633897463
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated.	2.2137164677598933
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated, and that action on this aspect will affect all the others.	3.109244923656113
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year?	2.0996945657202546
I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome.	2.7931519659199786
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	3.7178396055136838
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe.	2.754760367924915
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue.	3.3465072744096167
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness.	4.658770443646489
The first country is Indonesia.	1.4747861664135429
We all know what we would do, which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy.	3.8810190955861095
President Prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation, a paradox in the European Union and also throughout the world: we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium, dominated by the web of the Internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance, and we are living through a genuine change of epoch.	2.9332832102358077
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is.	1.5089337739432953
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	2.5511666691063435
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward.	2.374181618729017
It would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned, otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens.	2.881969279805284
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	2.492492841383847
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	2.0949682180294116
Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem.	2.987615982997737
In its 1998 policy paper, Agenda 2000, the Commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based: the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas.	2.7566087784366062
Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process.	4.144032090291552
Question No 7 by (H-0035/00):	1.1672026996941478
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses.	2.727109648095182
I utterly reject this!	1.6366327466390524
For me this raises the following questions: who will work there?	1.761439347948947
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence.	3.8691893879400756
I find the opposite the case.	2.2307897186088703
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations.	1.4526743064705823
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians.	2.012956549127709
We want a strong Commission, which can act in an independent and neutral manner, but with political sense.	3.298499276764127
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept, Amendments Nos 3, 12 and 13.	3.2372131515378735
As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency.	2.9933009832352413
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies.	2.7875791862156936
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will, therefore, be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management.	2.8091021467736526
The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects.	2.6141251082548314
That is our duty.	4.295646259864779
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic.	2.94635078124426
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	2.2429810061793356
The text therefore reads: 'instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation' .	1.8554687896103377
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating.	3.8658139497027197
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues.	2.2588472527668637
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions.	2.7863261035984563
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Commission taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	2.0183866391207523
A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights.	2.5003532475221695
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about.	3.6864229179480326
On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region.	3.6901380458766164
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector.	2.3637626480399647
To conclude, Mr President, allow me to remind the House that the directive needs a makeover which will make UCITS even more attractive, but it does not need to be strapped into a European corset which will squeeze the life out of it.	3.593034309997073
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime.	2.8367027184032345
It has no right to do so.	2.448444520526602
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report.	4.1953511935623204
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators.	1.9559664460248127
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II.	2.453214284323242
Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character.	3.951443731504956
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation.	2.53993937857122
Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures.	3.834387820734003
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	4.085214575518554
This is not policy; it is life' s simple logic.	3.198366192610095
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM.	2.941044511970691
Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades.	2.4572494809997094
The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far.	3.178386582868355
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	7.437426117174559
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	2.519610154723393
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.	3.475060371498966
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon.	1.68816166775449
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management.	2.9285111110042177
I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy.	1.4951802979859272
This was an important consideration for us.	2.2714997795667298
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas.	1.888280709154784
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report.	3.4464025507275093
We do need to obtain, from the Commission and the Council, in other words from each of the governments forming the Union, a clear, positive or negative, political stance. They must indicate whether they are ready to defend, within competent public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund in the first instance, the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system.	3.1500196089717627
As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.	2.1513516126208168
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer.	2.1714953219169875
But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you?	2.541887720926457
The European Union is a system based on law.	3.642376307103912
Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner.	4.696471812667046
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans.	3.384505124609771
The first concerns women, gender and women's rights.	2.2268609653730485
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually.	2.187393861492816
The message contained in the joint text is still valid.	3.1907699570585946
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that, prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector, involving 1.7 million employees after all, the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation.	2.365822550990664
The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system.	2.7200050910297318
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions.	2.4743320098271377
I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view.	3.697688543049754
Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example.	2.477158928811053
Madam President, the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005. These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict.	3.503649072666828
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.	3.2763494860126805
Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted.	2.69230037841986
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council.	2.2971378445857766
I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it.	5.351655014986562
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years.	2.0957518969802424
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities.	1.836770573280584
Moreover, the cost will have to be borne in the future.	5.166119157393997
Europe was born out of a desire for peace, freedom and tolerance.	2.4597991187171937
Everything has become more and more complex.	2.849504629883595
"He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good; that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests; that it bides its time in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, and bookshelves; and that perhaps the day would come when, for the bane and the enlightening of men, it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city."	2.608713203411864
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory.	2.312689927876927
Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing.	2.693737854104288
The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground.	3.025645477288626
In my opinion, this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States.	3.46714868754146
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	3.092134470122121
There should therefore be a universal application: it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved.	2.603553023858013
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one.	3.3226687243093953
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion.	3.134079705982362
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ...	2.9075824419950758
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	3.1773037843240646
Not only that a conclusion can be reached, but that a successful conclusion can be reached, which is not necessarily the same thing.	3.1827579658412417
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	2.939547517995394
In Europe today, the tourism market contributes 5.5% of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce, approximately 6%.	2.51212050440047
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions.	2.5759099763903963
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors.	2.213118261271546
Given the urgency surrounding this issue, has the Commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti-fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud, in the Member States and in the European institutions, coming under the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice?	3.1939970562817024
I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus.	2.561300852197799
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat.	2.4122142087923852
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable.	1.4430655311578782
It seems contradictory.	1.279162940076972
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame.	1.726330525835913
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March.	3.4199526681711747
With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year.	3.0647334809418747
These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits.	2.5136861016686423
Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment.	2.6316321435819603
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	2.1030702917433706
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.	3.686379993383216
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments.	3.1697229867280137
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection, despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR.	2.112470528957387
Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	4.703011063892671
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	3.785015188523166
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.	2.421736692198396
As for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty, very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets.	1.8304370988171443
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission' s officials, which has been quite excellent.	5.51553402449814
First of all: who should pay?	4.385768041967593
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries.	2.2907656119780757
I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty.	3.007881554079702
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action.	2.6894272704026885
Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies.	3.0095470523002987
The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role.	2.648065683049261
Once again, an indigenous people' s right of existence is being threatened.	2.320741959361544
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	3.212043452929046
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations.	1.5844387390547245
It would weaken a key element of European policy.	2.0460402327343865
So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis?	2.6620942852572638
Between EUR 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets. In three or four days, this can equal the total figure of annual global production, or global GDP, of approximately EUR 6 000 billion.	1.956681547643075
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community.	2.3313955195539338
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak.	1.7589142061366723
Europe' s role: we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict: only then can we talk of the 'military' role of the Union.	2.661468589879689
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	2.046469913545524
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.	3.373907412494342
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways.	3.9807018774957976
And how should we achieve this?	1.9908704411996732
As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend.	2.0123063673267065
He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible.	3.01716456712314
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today.	4.54735427955407
I hope that this will be of benefit.	7.083994063137145
Recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (11221/1999 - COM(1998) 249 - C5 - 0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC))	2.3758115727516516
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.	2.494506587373718
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	2.5187705876241906
With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000.	3.3277452471601903
In fact, it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport.	2.1312759037172633
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace.	2.593929799437647
We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard.	2.9325551869185738
Here, then, I want to point out that international competition is tough and, if we are to overcome it positively, we must together envision and share a long-term strategy.	3.345320308786851
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control.	1.6171246625445297
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.	2.5646949397014134
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	2.713802579156706
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	4.659946620298205
But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual.	1.7672415801195984
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	2.383074480566515
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.	1.7680565740321013
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to: we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations.	3.215390923464541
I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001.	2.9947955817147416
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb.	1.5073600673309717
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report.	2.775778262846023
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency.	2.714565430403316
Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	2.3447171242288127
This time, however, it is true.	8.675602728919735
At the same time, it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries, and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty.	2.6739005017068473
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice.	2.6211818962719144
In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments.	3.515471580171756
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone.	2.437852450752204
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	2.1898719938652658
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution.	2.2830510978628515
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner.	2.9377567446974613
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM.	2.0462749186240923
You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.	4.850346989490752
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	2.4750677281220623
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip.	2.8173719780944277
. Let me associate myself, not least as a former Environment Minister, completely and without any reservation whatsoever, with the expressions of concern by honourable Members.	2.3106604517006484
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything.	1.5984886868589985
Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made.	3.550755967252441
That is why, where the good LEADER projects are concerned, we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable, positive component of our support to rural areas.	2.5635548902092884
We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them.	2.685248171061794
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level.	2.1037063665226112
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	3.3225887227723687
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives.	4.0478196905139265
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour.	4.008168950953911
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment.	4.10463533468078
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves.	3.173018125934575
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	2.4391890149216287
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is.	2.318935410690246
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples.	2.248310910499056
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	2.1351670635251794
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	3.4420099830991653
We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals.	1.842620814708025
There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity.	2.9203288082758183
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane.	2.49513896537125
Macro-economic policy, employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together.	3.0634139787428922
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged.	3.4760893651548814
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	2.620958765560499
In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.	3.1679064664023686
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	2.0777837152565914
Accordingly, we would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commission and Council Presidency to seize this political initiative, so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month. Rather, we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country, and I hope that in the process, you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months.	3.1938509255567835
We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead.	3.1224484165157387
This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers.	2.8713513531157333
We are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is to construct the European passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even-handedly across the board.	2.4774239044170927
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations.	3.005307741510367
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	3.0547751605801925
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context.	2.3846676331544825
However, experience has taught me that, in politics, modest ambitions are never the key to success!	2.5338450387825797
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	2.8509520759558695
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	3.5441609036673984
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said.	2.7914699839807944
Parliament' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets.	3.0825690654967883
No, you have not done so.	4.7060942101560705
I will give you an example.	2.9028021859738407
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	2.754125995229084
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.	3.482648084241197
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe.	2.292918554369379
Madam President, I would like to comment on the Florenz report.	3.5165513064833878
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	4.291578086250895
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights.	2.7343178882624346
Thank you. You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity.	2.2324907311963775
This means that we move away from shredding.	3.6095462102404055
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	1.9048313412690172
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment.	2.6526184578755356
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance.	1.9998052161238422
We need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the Union' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the Intergovernmental Conference table.	2.6420216950517768
This I think is the new Convention.	3.991297988241163
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on.	2.2383579696347655
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed.	2.867155554300663
Mr President, the storms which devastated France during the night between 26 and 27 December have caused, as has been said, 90 deaths and damage to a value of FF 75 billion, i.e. EUR 11 billion.	2.7933362245516076
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out.	3.2477059063446303
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.	2.5042816265710726
. I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive; it applies only to additives.	2.3514791460904934
It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available.	2.4144597966157613
Regarding sustainability indicators, the European Environment Agency is already working with the Commission on the issue.	3.5121537199575905
It is proof, as if we still needed it, of the fact that immature diplomacy, which defends no interests, unless of course they are individual interests, and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly NGOs, is not just inefficient, it is positively dangerous.	2.6684917979850034
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	2.840692955580314
I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing.	3.3240475774167346
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources.	4.7198740283355605
Mr President, I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment.	2.765784508956573
In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law.	2.3763095141392006
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	3.2236209468938855
In his poem "Herinneringen aan Holland" [ "Reminiscing about Holland" ], a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too, which, with its never-ending trail of destruction, was feared and respected.	2.201839188148667
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen.	3.802929718229142
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	3.5830377218240326
How do you intend to make our people understand that, today like always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is, and will remain, essential in the context of population?	2.8998138039579784
OLAF, Europol and the Treaty on Extradition and Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters should be used fully and, when the Fraud Convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the Member States, we can also achieve a lot with this.	3.017704234557682
Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level.	3.5080286225916835
So, in the first part on the new forms of European governance, the words 'federalism' and 'superstate' are not mentioned at all.	3.964991919139189
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level.	1.7795230048787172
Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government.	2.580616399477913
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies.	3.859650858460847
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	2.4179241478005764
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	3.3160916104213833
It is, therefore, surprising that this topic has, to date, not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way.	3.462999948753121
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	2.7438903588861048
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	2.3147872734806754
We should not be too masochistic.	5.425461727532801
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate.	2.585808683515102
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal, and that of course includes scrapie.	3.542074053770164
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history.	1.5484340716336402
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	3.4790430199464093
Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition.	3.6080360983768562
This is part of the solution.	5.026988609685199
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999.	3.8670223869752625
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union.	2.0136224314463114
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist.	2.183736104271485
Mr President, I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up.	2.893705518525044
And, again, I urge you, Madam President, to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently.	3.5153358070923915
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection.	3.2467180429337614
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to.	2.8440712409125046
In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded.	4.2483630562105645
Then, last November, before the ceasefire was over, the Spanish Government spokesman, Mr Piqué, declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country.	2.353064132610926
Therefore, Commissioner, we ask Mr Prodi to present us with a bold programme, and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat, but not with this Parliament, which expects profound and daring changes.	2.7890855625471374
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.	2.1829504919372678
With regard to INTERREG, we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation.	5.0585424166869375
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector.	1.6911716646299921
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances.	1.9193700906899418
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company.	2.3918927160460806
The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	3.086990256900802
On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'.	2.717657953173497
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	3.314923808279778
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	3.305049197812348
The ecological disaster is a major one, possibly unprecedented in scale.	2.235354967042037
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.	2.835975214344818
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement.	2.7923348396612253
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project.	2.604976999494005
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves.	3.1476729174945746
My question is this: is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development?	2.692138745497121
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community.	3.5350124622313723
Madam President, there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union.	4.7620025882482215
What is now needed is action.	1.929622009191869
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	3.2986309034770986
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	2.3658382009820618
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	2.0239917172242237
And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community.	2.6329354862913763
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy, real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream.	3.1505043316495644
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa, given the involvement of certain countries in others.	2.5816701129205617
In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars.	3.0338408756322166
The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity.	2.691008797829241
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union.	3.421683711820628
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices.	3.3428673350709026
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement.	2.382324935552939
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development.	2.810031329550482
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means.	4.090673012484044
The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets.	2.832125229821992
After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time.	3.6673698834931012
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.	2.5829578872004233
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form.	2.4850621039634726
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome.	2.854353683280939
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely.	2.230421326462795
My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one.	4.879784362606453
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	2.4125799570263555
According to the general regulations, however, any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20, and not Article 23.	2.9947087825583396
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things.	3.5947512237403974
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector.	1.6539202939778515
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones.	2.9740428588341614
Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation.	3.8403390178462833
Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late.	3.355721674524148
This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens.	2.9546486350019836
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	3.078858801797647
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history.	2.1153458689807962
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year.	2.636423707520239
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible.	1.7618511182479673
In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect.	4.472601839902615
According to information received from the International Atomic Agency, the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in June 1998 in Adana.	2.2816556037492233
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
I recommend the report to the House.	3.0688750271587937
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.	2.46677367123752
As I have said, we are not opposed to such a study.	4.649867547825815
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	3.2454814565185517
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	2.8049744543652597
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro!	2.436926360126933
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure.	3.0297817557205104
This reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries' petroleum industry, because it requires huge investment in structures, infrastructures, entrepreneurship, professional expertise, social services and training; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities: agriculture, small firms in the industrial and craft sector, transport, services, retail sector, training, etc; that the development of the Community' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the Community objectives; that the varied geography and historical, cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited.	2.2366679976150663
The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people.	3.043144112740222
Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have watched this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened. This is because we felt the problem to be ours, as it was.	3.329125097445742
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	3.3146587147317828
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.	2.7421050166639005
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable.	2.4151673741380115
However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries.	2.8748030411654097
It should prevent society from splintering.	1.7138221556132973
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale.	1.996794241432474
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences.	2.212373511319798
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is, I am afraid, just an excuse.	3.610211421026421
I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen.	3.190875256045481
We have three outstanding problems.	1.8940507788901082
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low.	1.7979623587050786
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	2.6943000486412476
Four, to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee, at least one Member per political group.	2.753757288766644
At a more central level, there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors, international NGOs, indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted.	1.9535493772585604
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	1.4767609122992202
I do not understand why the power centres of Europe are keeping quiet, letting things pass and, by working with the Russians as if nothing were amiss, giving its support to the government which is waging this war.	2.3548102220056775
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level.	3.606088005898231
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	2.9788036603246475
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September.	4.0920724631665735
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	3.068969361215981
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification.	2.5775472465695177
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people. There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations.	2.7510652162467966
Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible.	2.4742246293726544
The Presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in Europe, which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the Portuguese Presidency, in conjunction with the Commission, in February 2000.	3.3657035122330283
It is interesting for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation.	3.1974397411384197
The Commission acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting, construction, commissioning, operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in Turkey rests entirely with the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.	2.301789876126441
II. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (9614/1999 - C5-0167/1999 - 1999/0805(CNS))	1.7241377021651334
To this end, I shall confine myself to stressing, out of all the choices available, the importance of three priority decisions which should, in the drawing-up of action programmes for the government of the Union, be the basis for both the Commission' s agenda and the actions of the European Union in the coming months.	3.8760966894669657
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied, it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably.	2.4693206582855165
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and, together with my colleague, Nol Mamre, who is also a former Member of the European Parliament, we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay, to the south of the 47th parallel north, because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches, particularly at the moment.	3.263439832394329
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms.	3.357022987205206
Madam President, the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal.	4.804883681774585
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.	2.7345173034263848
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.	3.752925465712568
I want to refer to the political position here.	5.067138415300656
Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it.	2.2305071367604796
I have been working now in all industrial and service sectors, but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible.	2.3669441185524187
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level.	2.9825514853606783
Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support.	3.0574677062502156
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria.	2.2678448465162346
These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary.	3.5720216639985662
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see.	6.249920446363663
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	3.5543188629081377
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.	3.3837605112463547
There is, as yet, no European Court case law on Efterløn, but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality.	2.186415189964012
In particular, we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue.	2.942538682665451
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	2.9101380532579
I would like to present the Commission' s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament.	3.5034567869246476
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.	2.4637489823043097
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	1.8353990401949491
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has, in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds.	2.947368062330002
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes.	2.7822846934609378
It would be a serious matter if every non-European company were to learn to use Europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket, you do not have to pay for cooperation, you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone.	2.553024773788405
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.	2.7126955227235845
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.	2.1448825349221985
I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?	3.041557439133168
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along, namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars, paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government.	2.036559497193591
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament.	1.750927466532569
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus;	3.795919191662917
Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed.	4.271580500254308
The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions.	2.5225562816070695
With regard to the second contribution, what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.	3.136574008102985
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	3.241890922163586
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange.	3.6602145347095822
We are also doing a number of other things: in the European Union-China human rights dialogue, we have focused on a number of practical steps, including sending experts on assignment to Tibet, planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health, education and training for Tibetans.	2.882655771975394
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms.	2.1371881882529533
We must create a permanent and truly independent, excellent and transparent system of risk assessment.	1.7875869710640317
Let us not deceive ourselves: a Europe, one part of which is being held back because of frictions, misinterpretations and conflicts, and because of nationalistic clashes, will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants.	3.0685340114480835
But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research.	2.362809629992287
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation, adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States.	2.5027912494584097
However, please learn from the events of Seattle: we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade, on the one hand, with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend, on the other.	3.5661658416962734
Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' .	2.717691148534835
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done.	3.1241752213479366
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.	2.592461598324137
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	4.656363176146231
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another.	2.3579305179402104
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.452496672118657
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	2.7107652836752925
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise.	2.1589361154234523
We have taken almost eleven months - President Prodi was nominated at the Berlin Summit in March last year - to establish a legislative programme. This is not entirely President Prodi' s fault.	2.4105926535870172
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources, the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission.	2.398216684508854
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event.	4.2512295168478795
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	2.111461509051208
The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on.	2.2112943110466534
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development, combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes.	2.884209322697207
I just wanted to correct this.	1.4854031513663102
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union' s role in international development policies is significant.	3.589014068843153
This has not just happened.	2.1442198292487524
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	3.408389454902151
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers.	1.9966597120197096
But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	2.7488796187962885
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything.	1.463113486307543
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	3.2771653822630205
Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments.	3.7210038545119986
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.	3.714908874426411
However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.	3.807555038961776
It is not just a question of style.	4.8026044057036446
As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal.	3.5517616436904564
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	2.9360827416685495
.	77.3301660757284
So I welcome it as such.	1.8641865183508177
Compare it with what happens in December.	2.587155333138721
Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy.	4.596350810220216
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full.	2.36862353138279
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	2.4944455875640865
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence.	3.726051687006298
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	2.2128786364735475
So who is this then?	1.837902363113119
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and, in some cases, usefully clarified.	2.8043805780491766
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	2.5219423890695714
It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding.	2.567382340280672
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water.	1.632388214988796
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level.	1.7765245302919563
That is a more reasonable system.	4.276506650363137
We hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform.	3.397423609918605
We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	2.3278845369319363
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	2.6433927955308345
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information.	3.5453369941729456
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected.	2.6003800004104494
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.	3.4406230424249697
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that.	2.8272635263017936
We are, for example, still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize. The recommendation for this dates from 1996.	2.927690055103915
Mr High Representative, you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki.	3.1145218175554343
Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.	4.258585278238471
I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed.	2.4161466979532693
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east.	1.9626483281080924
. I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, the committee chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for examining the Commission's proposal.	3.2749280207596767
Consequently, the Commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems, rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements, as should have been the case!	3.7768258069648777
However, we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place.	2.5560882116951595
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards.	2.8125148554478234
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue.	3.3726452773672273
Seven, to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency: for example, in reforestation following storm damage, or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick, etc.	2.8577153049619923
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.8336609721352835
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	2.917416595587963
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	2.823954174773661
On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement.	3.2236363818484546
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility.	3.4216999101168106
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent.	2.6378581404748562
In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	3.0315539553175372
The Europe of Schengen clearly finds it much easier to hound the persecuted from the south than dictators, even though the UN estimates that we will need 159 million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025.	2.553333464520385
We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours.	3.225653087472308
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	2.795881191266425
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside.	2.5314534214695645
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life.	2.8379533147607843
In particular, as agreed at the Human Rights Council Group on 9 February 2000, the European Union intends to table draft resolutions on the Israeli settlements, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma/Myanmar, a draft chairman' s statement on Colombia, and, possibly, on East Timor, together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries.	2.7592937229947956
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back.	1.6232897553470058
Women are no homogenous collective.	1.4716734040675727
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state.	6.091820692494255
We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market.	2.3720399000761105
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	2.173592561574781
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country's needs, but also of its policy performance.	2.816282878655857
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	2.2529495272544957
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.	2.336812836048138
During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy.	3.24016729806572
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions, because the point of departure is, of course, that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern.	3.50218463821655
For similar reasons, we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which, with the oral amendment, dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity, since political rights, not just voting in local elections, but political rights in general terms, form part of the sovereignty of Member States.	3.087549222662649
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	1.5736776105223242
It lasted only five months.	1.4991515698005304
On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us.	3.175245980837876
I would ask him to be brief.	4.288168913501436
This could be achieved by no longer insisting, in future, that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp.	2.707922501382636
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries.	2.4867180642110545
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week.	2.4962327676887415
The Council ought to have given Parliament the stipulated three-month period within which to consider, too, the last document produced on this matter, but we are all aware of how urgent it is to have these measures put safely in place.	2.8146062269193597
Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report.	6.246264360678886
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper.	5.120736436495911
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	3.858708817873245
He said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but, in the Commission' s draft, plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision-making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market. This means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the Member States to be changed by a majority in Brussels, even if a unanimous French National Assembly, a British House of Commons and a Dutch Lower House should be against this.	2.8498333569956142
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.	3.132599261113611
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers.	4.704322804608279
However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control.	2.4656843862521867
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban, Labour' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same.	1.8652566517939937
In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy.	2.707282662643198
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	2.342847814379655
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me.	3.4928199766160404
In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites.	2.6505597939201757
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.4550725128474453
There is no reason why, against this background, we should agree to grant discharge.	3.537404406600331
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	2.714035967519171
Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition.	2.8396950340227343
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	2.4077385749055678
But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels.	2.7502615078633434
Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned.	1.971523018439325
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	2.3620586387650526
Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world.	3.4094838560817866
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal, Mr Byrne.	2.356354034504232
The fostering of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the Member States is not only unjustifiable, but, on the contrary, makes manifest the political expediencies and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them, to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit.	3.1560953196352757
These are the areas in which changes will be made.	3.63128577254593
In April 1999, Parliament again reiterated its position that the accession of Cyprus should benefit the whole island, and help towards a political solution, but that accession should not be dependent upon such a solution.	2.3257552773752095
It worked for us.	1.7251334163042629
Mr President, Mr Monti, the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the European Union, not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years, but also with a forward-looking view to the Union' s enlargement.	4.602132723659458
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done.	2.809264489942756
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage.	2.1788762461315434
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	3.701938089869184
This directive is a contribution to this.	4.262495401257084
This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there.	3.06388612178498
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy.	2.6236701448653736
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March.	1.7240302696020142
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail, Mr President, given the time constraints and also the interpreters' fees.	4.036732843629274
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	3.012903770792852
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all.	2.742541395265173
We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich.	2.802184332875111
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis.	2.0951811149529407
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	3.1072375720221244
With particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created, I would like to say, first, that there is, via the Social Fund, an entire equal opportunities pillar which the Member States must implement, i.e. special policies for women which must use Social Fund resources.	2.869633196600104
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made.	2.7877136112443415
Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	1.7952825249628854
We understand the context of this essential debate.	2.8111570974254754
This seems to be a good thing and useful.	5.658579354548262
Corinne Caillaux, who had probably been raped, was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train.	2.779004310029939
This is an extremely risky strategy.	4.560647005853591
The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider' s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.	2.500978068765914
Those rights are, by definition, universal.	2.4997893330556558
Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States.	3.0054976275233294
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too.	2.4756914520242024
Fifty years later, we are still unable to prevent genocide.	3.9351682168441062
Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front?	3.0492372051099745
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	2.1630742902395474
However, justice delayed is justice denied, and we must reflect on this notion.	2.6840136171955105
They want answers.	1.2444232546306861
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated.	1.6964718374481422
If we do reduce it, we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste.	2.0939820294057143
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence, the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs.	3.2052574678794796
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.9697653953137366
85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is.	3.5431455309112776
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk.	2.148297665776547
The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines.	4.219600244387144
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier.	2.3693955845952024
This applies both to the post and other sectors.	2.818471165101656
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be.	2.702509824192133
Nevertheless, I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition, which will evidently imply some concessions.	2.889899816933723
I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries.	2.886345698132511
Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS))	2.166033419636189
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	2.9831797171040995
Madam President, I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre.	4.549146894961698
To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.	2.9798479145098673
Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning.	3.9723228563959507
But there are some questions still outstanding.	3.5073498437720367
On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999.	2.2522609892259937
This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President.	3.6249318209256725
We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	1.7390437003612065
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations.	1.8059168793753027
The amendment which the Commission has proposed, namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987, is uncontested and has our full support.	2.4521489105992194
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well.	3.5730279127955864
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	2.8337973889906443
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?	3.0367089510551986
Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only.	3.623854353105628
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time.	3.5434593975428625
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	3.052430122410079
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium.	1.825811620467781
The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group.	3.612630763650622
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development, it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job.	2.6263370816022054
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years, an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument.	3.023597101945058
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	2.6552736522936904
Quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation, be it on the part of the Commission or of the Council, or even on the part of the European Parliament itself, and some Members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development.	3.421915002800382
I would like to finish off with this observation.	3.1906288083216734
We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.	2.6950907675472386
This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen.	2.362129012067882
Mr President, my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the URBAN initiative, in Ireland in particular, has been quite successful and I am keen that the European Union make a further contribution in that area.	4.322259255114396
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially.	2.5262698300632502
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 7.	2.788219916174368
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result.	3.0767146408382264
There are therefore two possible solutions: either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark, or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements.	2.03853422535499
NATO is largely European.	1.5009960724361144
What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position.	4.182024627782825
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms.	2.169226176690095
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations.	2.0272955494879192
Mr President, I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation.	3.040783578962387
Furthermore, it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and I anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at Helsinki.	2.7919219819210173
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy, albeit not for every individual animal.	1.752818114309499
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
But the Council' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts.	2.1488173195118425
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	2.5846285578623385
So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this.	2.462605000107225
I think that this is an extremely important point: this sense of conditionality, which underlies the European Union' s position, is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained.	3.3500202420891894
If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built.	3.214878720910454
Why?	48.116547780453246
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	3.671540582627143
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.	2.3666998761598963
It is of key importance that the American authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a dignified alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life.	2.39615594714031
In my opinion, the Commissioner is quite right.	5.128522940109877
They want to see results.	6.693486182486988
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions.	2.387192442247056
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	2.5444978396686353
Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors.	3.2375099386089294
Is that the message we want to send out?	6.895119778639329
It is about keeping communities together.	2.622666841686219
Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said.	3.4060245432264757
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity.	3.3629429850150725
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up, but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure.	4.906792117545224
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal.	3.096183431326287
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments.	1.9027519169527147
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar.	1.8901278983795424
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	3.396608673542666
However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process.	3.611371847905716
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter.	2.7418770899094063
The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	5.417427530427524
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject.	2.333776032172951
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.	3.659858895372377
Mr President, legislating in criminal matters is often countered, wrongly, with arguments of individual freedom and security.	2.7119814213746154
And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked.	4.163535757782562
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	3.538135212447353
(Applause) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays.	2.1464479234843807
Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully.	3.8616208836243513
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.	1.9860176922626407
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	3.501447540407183
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level.	2.233185171018429
The House will be aware, of course, that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone.	3.9487493610905555
I believe that if it is understood properly, the regional approach is both important and necessary.	3.0054542259826196
To grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of Europe, it is worth pointing out that in my own country, Greece, a country that attracts tourists, over the past four decades, during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over-concentrated in the major urban centres, the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed.	2.524241564945268
For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars.	2.470960118913309
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field: food must be of the same standard in all Member States.	3.0301594729186148
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	3.1683229044512418
Reconciliation with your neighbours was, and still is, a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance.	2.1847732856502677
Finally, the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity; nor Amendment No 19, which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage.	3.150940242668616
We need, at the end of the day, to ensure that we end up with a sensible, balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost.	2.8487107862506735
Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	3.0855854589368965
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average.	2.5706774228075724
Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports.	3.3175874784222854
We must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the European Union without having stood trial and that, in some states, custody is abused and used as a means of extorting confessions.	3.105723313182792
The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.	2.656248153263677
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows?	2.1547910231458722
So what was done at Amsterdam?	1.7630838341529576
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	2.7834010891081196
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee.	3.221890204297701
The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion.	2.0957615755828827
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect.	2.3281452719751536
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.	4.155802605700725
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	3.4899906288146414
In this light, I think that the European Parliament' s role will be limited in Lisbon, but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation, but are unsure as to the input we can have.	3.3361713333397818
In terms of balance, or should I say imbalance, I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict.	3.3021147804227113
Mr President, I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home.	2.957452456987629
Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents.	4.296148069701464
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly.	2.8695968976691155
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe.	2.1829152374164513
With regard to the IGC and this issue of the fight against fraud, and specifically fraud against the Community budget and interests, we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a European public prosecutor. We have done this in the spirit of this House' s work and perhaps by going down the same road.	3.1711250771054775
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.6634238620972148
In return for this, however, we want early notification obligations to be discontinued, rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other Member State along with them, and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his/her posting.	3.1705702204101884
I also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and I can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 January, if the programme is presented before 30 April.	2.5312445169756352
However, I must again congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Gallagher.	5.114278140150216
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing.	1.7329810853170406
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU.	2.3973812344095946
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	2.901965965257961
That is what we are lacking, Commissioner: the political will to make a start in tackling speculation.	3.1165318817840517
We already have legislation.	3.6674237174541746
We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe?	2.6487519564788666
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	3.2423258484358324
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world' s most important reserve currencies.	2.734865616392101
That is why, in accordance with Declaration No 31, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation, resulting in the new Council decision, which revises the old system quite substantially, although we are not entirely satisfied with it.	2.936057082009951
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	3.1455239108329884
Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples.	2.728434059984814
Mr Fischler, I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting.	2.9908359057370117
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	2.1558445722925303
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need.	2.5495738290539354
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.	2.4197696587357083
As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika.	3.2931386490227217
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.	4.051379951208356
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us.	3.2173641000714746
(FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta, whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean.	2.938001406900038
Flora defended herself, and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands.	1.5680135248872618
The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious.	4.128573269695484
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible.	1.5468177194255799
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue.	2.175944204849683
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver.	2.423157830704914
Personally, I am rather in favour of the term "EU service provision card" which is proposed in Amendment No 1, but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this.	3.3599368306566113
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms, it is their use which must be questioned today.	3.095140058267896
Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the "founding" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6.	3.429782973480539
The silt was in fact shifted 3 kilometres, at a cost of FF 6 million, the cure being worse than the disease, and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site.	2.2979748788265577
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised.	1.6555502209059854
That should be our task, not political posturing.	3.1008071456983446
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place.	2.413986058295215
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets, because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably.	2.1347566866038292
If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used the Community budget to help the victims, but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so.	2.8465890845218134
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	2.33837572609589
I do not use those as an excuse.	4.307590864140621
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO.	2.0741807776518386
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	2.470950716678723
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health, whereby the accent is clearly on sources.	2.885622885521208
For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy.	2.7867096465503223
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people.	4.3394029495741435
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	3.2262293599190017
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal.	2.195449561813917
This document stems from the previous Commission. It is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by Commissioner Papoutsis throughout his term of office and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and his failed Philoxenia programme.	2.7945695512255577
But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one.	2.415514423197793
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	2.328142387442962
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers.	2.7269499764714666
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy.	1.6653947187058475
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too, will certainly be both timely and welcome.	4.119608488246694
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory.	2.8904127984311563
In all these respects we must ensure real, significant change, including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards, including the mandatory double hull, on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of Member States.	2.030147641934789
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	2.2561100821941333
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future.	2.194575425216772
I am very fond of him.	3.093622607066963
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good.	2.865894596724809
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	2.8863224900007913
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation.	2.086734566447452
However, more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so.	2.2442642208437644
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law.	3.0564462215258135
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation.	2.379218950120076
In Europe, in your rapporteur' s opinion, this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years, not just once but repeatedly.	3.05196918666431
We will have the chance to scrutinise, to debate, to question.	3.231198414485977
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term.	2.3934482753684523
But this new course of action is very exciting.	1.978744722002828
In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course.	6.0693104970338245
Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed.	2.0582102082463463
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture, fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised.	2.0438845657216604
Furthermore, although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme, the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed.	2.3630214290418237
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	2.6706493823300113
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ. On the contrary, they will strengthen them.	2.8024492753611066
The most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in September 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year.	2.4307623590638383
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim, I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether.	2.308695643202954
Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless.	3.53530650849365
Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate.	3.1040125017779814
Some areas are becoming drier, whilst many are becoming wetter.	1.9901390545521256
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs.	2.4853887754405624
It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.	2.9639440498979113
I am in favour of collection free of charge.	2.6515630422121417
Unlike the previous speaker, who has now disappeared, my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor.	3.339418063019032
I think that he is correct in this regard.	4.684780581765989
I also want at this stage to say that I was able to propose this initiative to the Commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague, Viviane Reding. This initiative was also established in conjunction with Günter Verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement, both its opportunities and risks, and of institutional reform.	3.0068708030089013
This is my first point regarding the policy.	3.072684987356724
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April.	2.5653453845692527
Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda.	3.72083553112804
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries.	2.8413817391513145
It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern, multinational organisation.	2.552491447651654
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions, which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand.	2.515355658551526
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat.	2.248687669453016
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	2.156097854194843
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army.	3.7726926440597253
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU.	3.3873290343811013
The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December.	2.950739376279637
My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well.	3.693971312512809
If such implementing measures are referred back, it should be to both branches, not to one branch alone.	2.666685757128298
They call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the Adriatic, as well as to the Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta - an applicant country - which, inexplicably, are not currently included in strand A, Annex 1.	2.7946554870070233
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission, only time will tell.	3.7314637769776304
That could convince people that Europe, in its governance, is not something run exclusively from Brussels, which concentrates and soaks up more powers, more decisions, more authority.	2.238453825786339
This will either be the century of waste management or it will not.	2.335067277452195
Once more, we point to the negative changes of the CAP (1992 - Agenda 2000).	1.9979240415865918
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	2.2448086642065745
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty.	3.1774966172534778
Shipwreck of the Erika	1.9974572123436003
Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	2.9445913887706925
Capital tax	72.17482167067989
The creation of this taxation, of either the Tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by Professor Lauré, could prove to be politically opportune, at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate. This is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of States.	2.3244754766686673
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today.	3.3776734550209353
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	2.4264441458270625
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	2.9576995143734606
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months, which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency.	3.2676223947042247
The same can be said with regard to transfers.	3.1134379351707873
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	3.3992571761294417
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	3.4393392991458476
In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe.	2.519359596021223
.	77.3301660757284
On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.	2.4850510814864575
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting.	2.4478429584821457
For example, adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts.	2.384194615495091
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen?	3.091627668373865
Recently, the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions.	2.1505794260828197
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	2.92775136076198
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes?	2.1381980892367376
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	1.5858065398056027
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	2.3974611825946073
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	5.978237648760603
I have no intention of talking about past events; rather I want to look to the future.	2.9036346100820554
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002.	3.4298022582636087
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas.	2.4527934557615976
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected.	2.7913636208891432
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track, although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament' s motions are anything to go by.	3.1205766538198483
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today, the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual.	2.848868100224555
I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt.	3.6146941268813624
And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations.	3.1785495907651047
It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it.	2.9472232973787293
I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe.	2.6778138231153346
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept, regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way.	3.3015866994523515
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar.	3.780841929164376
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change.	2.022904430285655
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere.	3.6858580855119722
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion.	3.006672072488734
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000.	3.6160657178921887
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection.	3.1885741597343857
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here!	1.6642306348972962
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement.	4.305909548928421
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth, not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy.	2.7024015130159476
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	3.4983307547876588
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, although there has indeed been an economic disaster, the real ecological catastrophes are still to come.	2.883731310744411
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	3.542031459104214
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day.	2.353909005039829
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.	3.2950162947061648
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks.	2.0915840413024074
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	2.4483675726211205
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption, violence and war.	1.8859351874762875
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures.	2.5425427376759373
All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon.	3.3656144076088976
I should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand A of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand III C and, finally, in requesting that Members of the European Parliament should be involved in the European Observatory for cross-border, transregional and interregional cooperation.	2.98746913415402
The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed.	2.6817906181827444
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion.	2.8083959640294798
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis.	3.289200370136356
Unfortunately, it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality.	5.791422843517315
However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve.	2.5790370508856246
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	2.828815224255516
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.	3.340813835705765
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences.	3.35114711868608
At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important.	1.948381197484371
It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term.	2.5125478467627986
The third area of incoherence is human rights.	1.9087006925697239
We are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion, especially in the sparsely populated rural areas, one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning.	3.39150209688198
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative.	4.093693350722757
I should like to have an answer to that question.	4.002451748798906
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	3.088091943715051
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	3.157334894639369
These are the three most important aims of the directive.	3.668360223650478
Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor.	3.7368206450502544
The controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing, rather there must be materials testing, for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue.	2.5601683326366675
Yet the whole of the Commission communication is based on the opposite theory. In this theory, on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples, their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations, new policies or new, restrictive legal structures such as the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.578235369052456
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions.	2.71187394960967
It is as simple as that.	2.5221466685323635
The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation.	2.1317615808754744
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.	2.899199409764525
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility.	3.871666572672999
I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns.	2.657386996235746
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	3.8652906937108784
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	2.3009244957684767
At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo.	3.331368521350314
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	1.8934684945172346
For all these reasons, I think that reforming the Treaties would allow the huge tourist question, which is an important asset for the whole planet, to be properly integrated.	3.4269057295832086
Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is not a technical debate, contrary to what we may think.	4.424395116382171
Question No 37 by (H-0791/99):	1.2605856117352525
That is why again, in my report, I have asked that action under the URBAN Programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have single, "mono" problems.	3.1152362138133776
With the approval of this agreement, we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned. However, it constitutes real progress in the right direction, which is something we do not wish to obstruct.	3.3408972171121127
The first and most serious criticism concerns the Commission' s propensity for rather grandiloquent self-satisfaction with regard to the European Union and for a cursory and even condescending view of our partners.	3.9413468543768593
It raises expectations, but it can also lead to disappointment.	3.0119801395075108
In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death.	2.73907685188718
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	3.7011573152438313
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	3.223649295569178
Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units.	3.36798740190344
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	3.3106589941580946
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	2.54988292656234
We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive.	3.9164092470111695
Mr President, the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between Syria and Israel is not good news, but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people.	2.3386956000621653
Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team.	2.2411185351970975
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	3.4197693463625516
Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	2.5078853114718935
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks.	3.769082353086784
During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model.	2.2399763100365697
Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient.	3.5984724831303416
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	2.0584651255562414
What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment.	3.4691298507032844
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies.	2.5196435480002695
Because Denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules, provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that, apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation, the hours in universally applicable collective agreements, concluded by the most representative organisations, also apply to posted workers.	2.18326366595697
We share them.	2.3924081006354587
Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that 'Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation' .	3.3455362614113913
At present, the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the Palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first, while the Israeli Government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security.	2.6129565843080833
Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	3.242305491639854
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	1.8661367655390095
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention.	3.451861619069796
Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General.	2.1884440696951284
Mr President, at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt, our rapporteur.	3.5878039285823795
This report is a wake-up call to Europe.	3.638641322437167
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament.	3.842769340459743
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	2.848198139484114
We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is.	3.1737601548335985
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	3.6396367552045215
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control.	2.816718274785731
Secondly, it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations, which were advocated by the European Parliament at first reading. Specifically, these are: to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects, and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination.	3.039219926546328
Vote	21.75018985665072
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda.	2.834818000698304
It is very clear, however, that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched.	5.337464004190365
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency.	2.619117550916115
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	3.732530670159037
The recent dioxin scare in Belgium, prior to that the BSE crisis in Britain, and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically-modified foods, have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat.	2.9172133392665183
The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.	2.6553669335106584
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.	2.802677640225818
I should point out that 70% of funding for the period 2000-2006, i.e. EUR 195 billion, will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe.	3.1772909176606494
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made, unfortunately, only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million, and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set.	3.0880519511270035
My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate.	3.1090827418542775
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	1.8934684945172346
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	2.006253176739339
. (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question.	3.6476400466818144
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy.	1.6756551917706464
The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector.	3.623350021477184
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union.	3.390368529316415
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development.	3.497161085953397
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.	2.662109305515608
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.5188712904074
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices.	2.0350058270314078
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance.	1.6407384427351752
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic, more transparent, and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding.	3.4939427599376462
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents.	2.8857623711334837
Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive.	2.5120953964705532
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily.	2.881481798131946
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.	3.331362036733207
These costs are not very high.	2.946795889206288
Fourthly, we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined.	2.706394912882825
At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto.	3.66533050693782
I was able to talk to Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit about this issue when I visited Ankara myself, and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with Turkey' s particular approach to this question, I believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss.	3.084657280814609
You have to admit: this is a joke.	6.269985440467329
Commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach.	1.4305758079903241
However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves.	3.3234114830989063
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe, the former USSR and Asia, where there is greater opportunity for profit.	2.8735475754646163
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health.	3.097352158582073
The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	2.5293633150215364
It has never been done in south-east Asia, it has never been done in Europe, and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber, given Austria' s financial record.	2.961943177600226
Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say.	3.469714562433383
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment.	2.717068599870141
First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires.	3.341532268496563
They cover a commitment by FYROM to approximate its legislation to that of the European Community, notably in key areas of the internal market; and they cover provisions on cooperation with FYROM in a wide range of fields, including justice and home affairs.	2.5768693460116214
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	2.4855343586669574
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum.	3.494145255610287
In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate.	2.303000181896478
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years, I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann.	3.5358480836893964
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	2.27031696249734
This is a big problem in my opinion.	7.2387894105066515
I consider this to be very encouraging news.	3.2237611954769814
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way, overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported.	3.086293539401793
In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable.	3.1861952565395395
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that, unfortunately, democracy is not fully functioning yet.	2.7216616609077575
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)	1.6865072109042134
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea.	2.36819587287833
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	4.2050342209770895
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say.	2.1279536771563112
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.4364124492888106
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice should be mentioned, we must remember that there is still room for progress.	2.8548394230019647
The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future.	3.3243301869581203
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance, and that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up.	3.014149041613691
It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice.	3.845496114333422
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote.	2.027035059650599
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region.	1.9366475811455262
Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	2.4911313287552344
(End of fiction).	1.3883115371953176
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable.	2.4975479518577504
Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground.	3.132453993214561
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	2.566971203738481
This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights.	2.4307448356423493
I just mention that to complete the view of the process.	3.126432036519837
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	2.405038983398913
It need only be fine-tuned.	1.8159329017466292
We are badly behind now in this matter.	1.5757935649191819
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences.	5.541260225078912
I will tell you a few things we should do.	2.796159847065989
It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly.	3.260618177770089
Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, the 1999 harvest of decisions was indeed rich, so much so that it became difficult to gather, i.e. to put those decisions into practice.	3.06426721866854
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte, who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility, for the fifteen Member States of the Union, of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy, a sensible European Union initiative in this field.	2.8710065490644494
The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst.	2.793648717888323
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines.	2.5629352696735577
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo.	3.8079304464989088
Instead, my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.373084134545684
It is important to point this out.	3.643315263349124
We are discussing coherence here.	3.6774354333840473
Obviously, in the wake of the introduction of the euro, we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets.	3.141823274126956
I would first of all like to focus on quality.	3.5356212576246437
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.	2.488014979258912
They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website.	4.177798170387403
Thank you very much, Commissioner Byrne.	3.1931591856892267
This is a true example of the Council' s indifference towards culture, despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance.	3.442456137704153
Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list.	2.543406242481861
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13.	3.8172987614421765
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well.	2.031961214755704
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	3.0987418346176834
Well, that depends on who the legislators are.	1.9047281263045173
This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue.	3.252090100504825
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.	5.059773151132983
Moreover, the European welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation.	3.4748783660506195
You have to see this as a tool for risk management.	4.676287731919319
Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration.	4.1202655427533665
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment.	2.0913355559563755
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously.	2.5057304420728754
It is a retrograde step.	7.964169434036672
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos.	2.2152469309041702
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures.	4.665075249573537
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	1.7886444960464025
The current example of the Danube and the pollution from Rumania shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development, clear requirements, controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers, this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time.	2.4142634600428297
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	3.1876853985865194
The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union.	2.059727741836047
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission.	4.8689895442250375
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	2.97799221442959
Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you.	1.8437989239396664
I should like to hope that such an appeal from Europe, with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement, would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the Skopje government, so that it can respond appropriately, on the one hand, to Greece' s demonstrably conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue, and, on the other hand, to the more general practical, declared intention and disposition of all the partners in the European Union, including Greece, to facilitate and support FYROM' s progress towards a United Europe.	2.7324098190503774
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure, so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism.	2.500521170465863
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy.	1.8597686903147934
Mr President, I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report.	3.2680318733350733
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature.	2.9915737270331504
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.	3.35426032621422
We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it.	2.456384990806828
However, all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles.	2.286031281363409
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system.	2.705803000426428
The newspaper reports were misleading.	1.7030192079965358
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy.	3.96133720264874
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	4.188497417519195
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, let me say how disappointed I am, because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago.	2.3963489819838135
First: a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed.	2.224798293967239
I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House.	3.5838628441713136
This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa.	2.17532540203912
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings.	2.909541465548971
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	2.7935423176075305
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0014/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Regulation on a financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.4415066940756383
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999.	2.200873389252605
Mr Schulz should be aware of this.	2.6361940290065085
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	3.072673912686893
Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House.	2.7178464565464613
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers.	1.764088015454193
There are twin problems that still remain for many regions in Europe: firstly, the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road, water treatment facilities and related transport networks; secondly, the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment, which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of Europe.	2.753195368070044
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully.	2.2075062379104082
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced	2.6841360559217553
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.	2.8318747206802732
Subject: Implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey Given that Turkey has recently been granted applicant country status, what is the Commission's view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the Ilisu Dam, given the massive displacement of the Kurdish and the other people of the region that will result?	3.40324407747409
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved.	2.681084742462121
Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997.	4.866939176119779
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	3.300123099644898
We need bold change and, at the same time, we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States.	2.737395668450747
Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway.	2.6233578864284404
I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined.	3.4131132814377136
The holocaust, fifty years ago, led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms.	4.283524132845079
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities, in general terms, are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years.	2.4453167073188813
Mr President, Commissioner, this morning on French national radio, I heard that liberalisation of the French postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable, like the developments with our neighbours in Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany.	2.757543194141266
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.	3.7676002534331694
This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support.	3.7176751910223733
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO.	2.0159484859173333
This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal.	2.797219367741413
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	3.934478854073226
Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational, misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right.	1.5698778590624478
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	2.2782392352023537
What are we actually doing then?	2.2485824585199192
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern.	2.790247811616418
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government.	3.269301943211293
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons.	3.5565807332025248
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy.	3.058176737031887
I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.	3.7585290076652216
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	3.142242655935561
We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations.	2.635021414160454
In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	2.7677407975885417
It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	3.053759347224097
Honourable Member, I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law.	2.9404267036648917
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.	1.9354707150302968
We will cut them off.	1.7668865207229203
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives.	2.703730269110724
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights.	2.6004853592990926
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives.	2.5661140038548518
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative.	2.3981965796498628
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems.	2.2954136510864154
'Long-winded' .	77.3301660757284
In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance.	3.576029926056618
(SV) This is a very important question.	4.699304655057541
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions.	1.6563194267166046
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"	3.5621510988271026
Certainly not!	449.0601111516776
We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.	3.5768200288854004
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect.	1.9317930636293272
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	3.408618229068997
This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly.	2.861351292729584
But I want to add a word of caution.	3.7710686872279644
No, it does not!	5.601360778567927
Subject: Partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for Greece The recent Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership, involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies, the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding, monitoring and assessment of the measures taken.	2.524927530672917
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.	2.4328415803390855
VOTE	21.75018985665072
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	2.250422791786238
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	2.9754148624218786
Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing.	2.9289906052021473
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success.	2.9973779969590812
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken, particularly in the marine environment and, more precisely, the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans.	2.684714583545954
Also, Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such, thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions.	2.4992365532816665
I consider that this is a serious defect and that, in principle, it does not befit our legal system.	5.114933678401067
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets.	2.9772633778273843
An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty.	2.718670100330586
We need to be sure that if need be, the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability.	2.7009904351288774
So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future.	3.6511539691384765
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	3.5098599188351827
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.	2.7373670393376357
Is there any prospect of membership?	2.6438071193542423
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy.	3.48382482568318
The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal.	3.5894757187636452
It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed.	2.2896384699059076
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union's food safety regime.	3.253935983007669
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another.	2.263695173040443
We need to wait and see what happens there.	4.707125004602878
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level.	2.7292890631875997
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics.	2.4631207309604624
The stronger the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.	2.5762122378869172
Like everybody in this House, I want freedom, justice and security. I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation, chaos and confusion.	2.948358577337938
In this sense, the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom, security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers.	3.001580294466871
During the previous question, we were discussing electoral issues.	2.657771182854823
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions!	2.0698857616020687
I would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small Member States to nominate a European Commissioner that the United States of America gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the United States Senate.	3.030950947490287
Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible.	2.240765763552675
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega.	5.2388338605142915
Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation?	2.5453000846968576
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it.	3.1299947646821358
The general lines of the implemented economic policy, the Stability Pact and the strict convergence programmes, which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations, and the organisation of labour, along with Commission and the ESF decisions relating to salary and wage restraint, and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much-vaunted monetary stability at all costs, leave no doubt about the new strategy' s objectives and aspirations.	2.426602613265703
Since 1993 the Commission's European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.	2.4324266432391566
Secondly, we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused.	4.548748424407176
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future.	2.447480076474133
The first concerns this Parliament.	2.367789041396473
Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction.	2.6274844822806824
I have evidence that this is possible.	4.256190562983765
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business.	1.8299755593017253
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	3.449841438414603
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.1679077995870832
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders.	2.264271598405225
Rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in, by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration.	3.1497220269316055
A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending.	2.9850393939468836
Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament.	3.1456011405943642
Over the same period, Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million.	1.727002819886665
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself. As I have told Parliament, the task before us is immense and ambitious, and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge.	3.1446465722078547
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	3.290073555090785
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	4.810265088659788
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money.	2.7486624279397263
In specific terms, we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the Commission for the next round of WTO negotiations, at which this will be a central issue.	4.3495268185729055
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	3.025777942101588
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so.	2.5412152360855167
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice.	1.5557122205447262
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority.	2.530126963893261
I saw Member States working as a team, which was indeed a wonderful experience.	1.9732003714525255
We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue.	3.5347451640403795
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too.	3.0696951695549983
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings.	2.1940625430342795
On 26 November 1999, the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination.	4.592076287389808
It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union.	2.5839552016896783
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	3.5617126834612383
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion.	2.304353768748561
Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin.	3.231167539737818
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact.	3.150986599341535
As President Prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000-2005, boosting the Barcelona process is a priority for the Union, and the INTERREG III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.	3.2530181347007656
Secondly, when deciding which areas must be subsidised, we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects.	2.4781261618303807
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	2.2757654558005673
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	2.9621912343531713
Madam President, the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials.	3.969571667245677
Mr President, it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union, more so these days than there used to be.	3.7137999518952727
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.	4.29854154212609
However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment.	3.1715753554410298
It is not enough just to say, "You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!"	2.6092306290142497
For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment.	2.0450370210625652
The number of departments has been reduced.	3.8641247370146043
Mr President, for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money.	2.788903715725458
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	3.805453550607321
This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development.	2.414987213471847
Mr President, the question at issue is the income from the Swedish alcohol monopoly and when the Swedish Government says that it must cover health costs, then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves, with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal.	2.417898585473391
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	2.875243173690909
There are, of course, cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate, for example helping companies restructure.	2.8458317990590505
It is essential to establish a single European system, but one based on fairness, full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions, including an end to routine detention.	2.8514803405039135
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties.	2.448845445799283
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	2.248663532657405
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention.	2.7290454858857394
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments.	1.82088896442996
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.	2.7213066445658898
Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used.	2.3488854523539997
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial.	2.393465375443817
By means of amendments adopted in committee, Parliament has tried to supplement the Commission' s work, by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid, and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in Southern Europe.	2.932675881406532
So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified.	2.59901803016595
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this.	3.8126694615209407
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget.	3.854478531453788
As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood.	3.737163297507873
As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session.	2.7529262937825907
To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one.	2.266087019263199
Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation.	2.3079876916520337
Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are.	3.0068133945209228
The Commission' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts.	4.114435349107184
That is absolutely crucial.	3.882315709968957
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these, they can be found with the rapporteurs, among them the author of the report on this convention.	2.886195621833797
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana.	2.6301914852341244
But this is not in place.	7.7291271672862205
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	3.1688213906265226
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention, for the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment.	2.7363452041376517
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail.	3.1295224423640633
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do?	2.7283061362643632
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	3.20903515723812
A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases.	2.90372909546375
Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely.	2.38867184354579
In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks.	3.0742727469235214
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable.	2.18438639614688
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika.	3.1553627009725504
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation.	2.2434178720490836
For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees.	3.8468187300344763
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part.	2.8660973924690674
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	2.8078781890439077
Once again, we are losing a piece of our planet' s cultural and ecological heritage, despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights, on the protection of minorities, rights of indigenous peoples, etc., which have already been ratified.	3.508980462140316
How can those affected be compensated?	1.4841526252397592
It tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, Iraq, in the Israeli settlements, in Burma/Myanmar, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Sudan, and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on Colombia and on East Timor.	2.4719382550014135
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report.	2.790706600944874
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation.	2.9245804106157394
'Restore hope' , do you remember?	4.867764837413812
Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system?	2.404743351557947
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	2.1640413184414906
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.	2.3620107064950226
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	3.424685015930361
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	4.55495667017122
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	6.199002372873889
Too many young, new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years.	1.889620491510658
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	2.4867140422489165
However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments.	2.9232817196432093
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.	5.288786182547296
However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6, because they seem to us to be legally incorrect.	3.5353412604587793
The EU should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created, whatever that may mean.	3.0465942353368223
According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically.	2.8022072344323123
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	2.064804602005988
This responsibility cannot only be borne by the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, however much we like to see him or hear him talk, or by the Development Council or the parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.	2.641099735590625
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time, which is to say in time for the ninth report.	5.014339696058727
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency.	3.7698835922611758
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February.	4.034264359651873
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling.	3.391992845150939
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds?	3.027259236316543
What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased.	3.2970669361643368
Nor is our role confined to that of banker.	2.743231420802643
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries.	1.897019021934001
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure.	4.0268385960727215
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country.	2.429040643090639
Since, however, the Community is funding the exercise, it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment.	3.738656040118566
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank.	3.332285576299358
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock.	4.183885342271178
If I can make a literary commendation to the honourable Member, who I recognise is interested in these subjects, I recommend to him a book published just before Christmas written by Isabel Hilton, the distinguished journalist, on the problems of Tibet.	2.67779752665683
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks.	2.676354025545836
The Commission' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets (so-called OTC derivatives).	1.8897353612245102
Another important point is that we must do all we can, not just to prevent excessive deficits, but also to further reduce public deficits.	3.6510439195788216
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously.	2.5966585045184902
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	1.9086594477693082
The vote will be taken later this evening.	3.983849095899522
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region.	2.1980396031385947
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them.	2.735479575877738
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us.	2.4646078374951537
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	3.5629279276121664
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	3.4460940861781575
However, the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions, such as the decision to begin implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam, the decision to incorporate the Schengen Agreement into the Community pillar, and the decision of the Cologne Council to create a Charter of Fundamental Rights and the decision of the Extraordinary European Council in Tampere to bind the Member States to common directions, priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom, security and justice.	2.879377685356841
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	2.4592018535856153
We therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies.	2.986378733514385
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome.	3.9699785592001193
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.	3.5495253683840096
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up.	2.947898765464453
Agenda	21.75018985665072
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	3.1421279539601734
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars.	2.1726449829145325
These have been the most important moments in the Council' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union.	2.8138162682302843
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these.	2.754086894944955
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative.	3.3566032137057475
The EU should also, on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds, table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the Member States.	2.323619854643729
First, by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the Joint Assembly, as recommended in the Corrie report, thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged (regional economic partnership agreements).	2.2018491995217757
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	2.6180589354501027
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals.	3.214296991230591
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions.	3.1687639436745805
In my opinion, this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control.	4.1595761539161815
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg, the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon.	3.2919803759336896
Sadly, in this case, he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring.	3.318523744146291
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present, I think.	3.0101407847248454
This is a starting point and we have five years to succeed, provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity.	3.163589259881959
There has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument, which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and, moreover, would accord proper status to local bodies which, being independent, could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly, and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the Structural Funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency, concentration and administrative reform.	2.774613316562849
With every single geographical extension to the area covered by the EU, we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth, and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the Committee is contemplating, especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth.	3.0300231298744444
In the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation, the European Union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions, particularly in Eastern and Southern Europe.	2.7782437140029175
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands.	2.5419643523041375
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security.	4.447615302422052
The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes.	2.3199658563077166
But above all, the human rights policy is too fragmented.	4.179847087099716
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries.	1.7268926068838588
My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind?	3.034338016748111
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies.	3.3016384416321336
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable, except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions, or rather billions, into Switzerland.	2.08168971439407
I think that all of us, the personal representatives of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, your two representatives, and myself, as a representative of the Commission, will be going into matters in detail, but it will be afterwards, at a different level, one in which we will also be participating, that the last trade-offs must be made.	4.343009435124228
At the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by OLAF, without harming the administration of justice by each Member State and under the supervision of the European Court of Justice.	3.026412114877948
However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize.	2.791964799827136
The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.	3.790931145004485
As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for LEADER+ will again be presented to the STAR Committee so that the Member States can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 November.	3.203722725874953
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	2.547549480700458
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud.	5.057447030834627
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions.	2.364158852410352
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola.	1.8643170037808154
This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that.	3.5137110212706997
In response I can only say that this already exists.	3.139439010778921
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents.	1.9145985027403012
The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment.	3.5529752432842683
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	2.9475044125236223
In our view, the axes which could create a basis for its support are: the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector, the framing of a Community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market, coordination of the tourism policy with other, parallel Community policies which affect it directly or indirectly, a study of the sector, and the adoption of medium and long-term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product.	2.789530936526849
In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy?	6.186968564183012
May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas.	3.20982325321623
I would welcome more concrete information on this.	2.383361889847674
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament, coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water, I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive.	3.15166882718014
A study has shown that 90% of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10% between individuals.	2.7086691072689435
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	2.7471539371702196
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	3.635089187429251
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions. This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers, producers and industry generally.	1.6724488493146212
Moreover, I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER+.	3.2081235977363347
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union, resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste.	2.959046143341427
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help.	3.618480911625438
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe.	1.6739146370922577
Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble.	3.336383287985898
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question.	4.316183873232223
With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.	2.524781636766819
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do.	2.3265395217280687
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part.	2.219901218969385
Indeed, these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union.	3.751873752675066
You yourself, Mr President, spoke of a model of which, unfortunately, there is little mention in the document. You said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, both internally and towards the outside world, which differs from other models, including the US model.	3.169666173964069
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
The problem is not that only 25% are inspected, but rather how we select, how we find, the ships which constitute the highest risk, through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags.	2.2227958543753226
Koch Report (A5-0104/1999)	1.1705018427742722
Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers.	2.858903734504345
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources.	4.4873332576412
This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens.	3.4120370898370194
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion.	2.173945134163141
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning.	3.383045022511369
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units.	2.069009744395343
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision.	3.0703824710550984
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	1.7314965837009897
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	2.817506527709165
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union.	2.3745058656335853
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful.	2.055323978798146
In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety.	3.455986193316401
So, for example, the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia.	2.627664116999657
We should really talk about coherence in the development policy in the presence of Mr Prodi, for example, who has missed a great chance right from the outset, for he has allowed the development cooperation policy to fragment over three Commissioners - and this is better than four, I have to admit - but this does not really make for a coherent policy.	3.1492610375660397
That is an issue for consideration and discussion.	3.1676207963516254
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself.	2.5147893504559216
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report.	3.047219086737288
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977.	2.1748448046012427
It is a step in the right direction, even if one wonders why in heaven, with what right and with what respect for our citizens, we are further bolstering the monopoly of the English language in all documents distributed throughout Europe.	2.8608077585486873
The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.	3.617953048787807
It is better firstly because the framework proposal made LIFE I more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.	2.041310923869049
Mr President, what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.	3.6442083460130177
Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	4.246081810963845
And what exactly should be done?	2.4875794894104493
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty two thousand at Unilever, ten thousand at ABB/Alsthom Power, not to mention all the others.	2.319294462664308
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention.	4.693395784421515
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time.	2.6481167947242743
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month.	2.553495944945406
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources.	1.9655401845246079
Question No 8 by (H-0796/99):	1.2605856117352525
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal?	2.2261945050722582
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues.	3.6206458024512767
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	3.294634015467069
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit.	2.963830533783082
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities, as furthermore, did the President of the European Parliament, when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council.	2.9596465392932365
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal.	3.7238541734857487
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive.	1.8582757923069047
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed.	3.0799789801335375
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	1.6347498808265588
The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image.	2.1138668411150077
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.	3.1300753061475035
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.	2.4734678739641156
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates.	3.478244479529816
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government.	2.8986623274196646
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	4.179372991940169
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community.	1.768575619891313
Subject: Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict?	2.0068247372809247
I voted in favour of Mrs Stenzel' s report on the EQUAL initiative as I believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous NOW, HORIZON, YOUTHSTART and INTEGRA strands of the ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT initiatives.	2.9978167359639163
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	2.6147323274737317
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider' s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter.	2.516506425569899
He is not stupid. Certainly not!	1.9642447068865188
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate.	2.46029421998262
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster, national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected.	2.3643064015108397
A5-0037/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data, and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224(CNS)).	2.22563315482523
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.	4.650675764486337
I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region!	3.3417871375224912
A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.	2.3735834367392123
Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.	2.2562153469998916
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved.	2.4562807019448156
Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate.	4.484859341928523
We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	2.4286610089979583
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs.	2.4871277411548296
The Commission' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us, but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna.	3.5298289114564514
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.	3.4851720663745227
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates, financed by the European Union, the CSF.	2.7840738694360296
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane.	1.9759698545023987
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion. The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it.	2.704786975622477
Imprisonment, torture, the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth, are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum.	2.820148893705862
In March, the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague.	2.7723737687193304
B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain);	2.193979286399884
Thank you very much.	4.621811099361165
Anyway, we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more.	2.0851547724875257
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned, I am of the opinion that the Councils' objectives lack both commitment and ambition.	3.1947201385703274
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment.	2.5374551992559202
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to.	2.487747795502255
This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area.	2.0991751272829946
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16.	2.3379570198217965
So we come back to the previous problem.	3.5304268761264526
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities.	2.4914577083078053
You founded and signed Charter 77, the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people.	1.8781611943477985
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	1.939863741927131
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one.	3.405871852897546
Therefore, the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context.	5.218748322596844
In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997.	3.248111633105267
. (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE.	4.123480011471646
Could the Commissioner answer two questions.	1.7425625110948157
We have taken note of this.	2.8513715892662876
I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked.	3.1158785218651754
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas, however.	2.5253487730680106
We must not waiver in that commitment.	2.9573933752056294
Moreover, the Commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which, according to Article 23, it was to submit by 31 December 2000.	3.8542695563781537
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga, will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter.	2.5427028493375206
Mr President, how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental.	2.9440615232743887
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality, discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately, and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else.	2.4043682578119827
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse.	2.538553165945489
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres.	4.7089376309007465
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights.	2.260953356754686
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.	3.7800753782385788
In fact, over the last decade, the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century.	3.343316883820058
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	3.982464294280167
At the moment, social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy.	2.6797875905541413
But, unfortunately, we are aware since Seattle that the Commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage.	3.49361181682007
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.	2.426756936316404
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	3.503046209676358
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution.	2.3414470036998485
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union.	2.273014244850067
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	2.8107897827185147
I propose to confine my comments to two areas.	1.9484831629596442
It is downright scandalous what goes on!	1.3794797355964201
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this.	2.999880571156479
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	3.7556168377842774
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	1.650339612603897
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.	2.1284690609500663
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	4.961562531418027
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.	3.4952290301667515
An essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with Member States and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible.	3.918329636988928
Thirdly, we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports, that is in every port of the European Union.	3.2924632439091854
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.	2.015323360907989
These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes.	2.2009279866968643
Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel.	2.92148507041128
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality.	1.5647792695058542
First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers.	2.9427349483902705
Question Time (Council)	2.0788997051212883
I am sure that this study - if carried out objectively, with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible, not only in terms of its application, but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives.	3.0095147713527446
With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then.	2.802858165996666
There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease "unnecessary" activities.	2.419122056774104
Most importantly though, we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform, not just of the WTO but also of the ILO, the United Nations and above all, of the financial institutions, specifically the IMF and the World Bank.	4.183190760656848
It is also clear that if we do nothing, our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner.	3.4362309872022645
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants.	2.479956608343849
To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons.	2.260052949022759
Yesterday, when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent.	2.535202140326577
Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration.	2.7828964180496114
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that.	2.7501407695271882
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary.	2.7439976289476684
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	4.315849877483905
If not, will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area?	4.324533765656664
With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	3.0741164686774956
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?	2.335765480482083
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative.	3.929594449381818
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society.	3.01839078062448
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis' anti-Semitism, which of course is completely incorrect.	2.688359188196231
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing.	4.1678790278025
I have good reason for asking this.	2.0380713978182325
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings, primarily about our values.	1.4623269704637807
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year.	2.8944757386442084
The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures.	2.381913773479242
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit, and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes, indeed, but changes which have only made poverty worse.	2.3193955923488505
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	2.635666221250853
I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe.	2.7261772298922797
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	4.019036168463213
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.	2.820540615581283
In addition, I would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production, for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions.	2.4648405570635283
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	1.6261619578697537
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link.	1.8337325899261807
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying, about the difference between words and deeds.	2.12737183094333
I would also ask the Commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the EU' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing CO2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed.	2.7971326194815447
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure.	4.266774764728691
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	2.6252730078251427
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday.	4.1494444620865645
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	2.3667364721422475
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must, regrettably, punish it for losing so much.	2.1027810958680235
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures, but banning them.	1.8191047889563123
It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend.	3.984624586703026
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	2.0403140160574256
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law.	1.8775661169572386
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field.	3.9269864541969253
Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced.	2.8258739661540884
I would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously, and at the same time, from my position here in this Chamber, point to how important it is to support these regions and people.	3.126524335518108
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	3.980719105868083
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member.	4.084493768423559
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	3.161474702716731
I therefore believe that the European Union must, to start with, carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe.	3.4175689709867187
The unease is justified.	1.4211815879847243
It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution.	4.322511056995497
Madam President, with apologies to my friend, Enrique Barón Crespo, I should like to speak against this proposal.	3.5397568067126386
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	3.205838295042372
These initiatives, together with effective systems of control, are the key aspects for the future of fisheries.	3.206112069138198
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now.	2.478451962517073
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.	2.3572969431438664
This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.	3.210538275685918
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action.	3.199174958434461
My second point concerns the universal provision of services. What is happening on this score, how much does it cost, how does it work, how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have?	2.255100298456886
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.	2.7855358444979412
(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	1.5221401830512669
I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign?	2.526366438276081
Finally, I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation.	3.8351459627450897
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering.	3.1986628801463968
Thank you for your reply.	3.2912687552343085
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation, taking strict account of free competition, because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future.	2.9118191978002828
Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory.	3.2293978560614773
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process.	1.9276717774477967
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way.	2.389320594539642
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months.	2.6811258059171443
- (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999.	3.131558062286625
The definitions 'standardised futures contracts' and 'standardised options' should therefore be combined to form a new definition, 'financial derivative instruments' , which also covers OTC derivatives.	2.1297897481880903
Mr President, it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission, and I will refer to this later on.	4.798996557622551
Question No 12 by (H-0801/99):	1.2605856117352525
In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights.	2.8604431079857737
This is the best support we can give to European democracy.	3.612979668675163
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued.	2.9950429175859115
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases.	2.6937262302124863
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule.	3.3329774821578573
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	2.214872659173677
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	2.914495826146748
Company restructuring in Europe	1.1226716651411717
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet.	3.428432934962562
. (FR) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate.	2.2439587953159466
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate.	2.9517937595217525
We know that some Member States are still wavering, for example, between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, as in the Aspe valley.	3.743800247750078
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support.	4.011304953995706
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament.	2.796775820560695
However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations.	2.7684818961995767
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available.	2.4404921202665726
There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees.	3.310354083746839
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	2.2367018287928317
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown.	2.1533985111529015
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive.	3.286011646317265
Our policies in Africa lack coherence.	2.0626691970978457
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue.	3.1225870293605853
Thirdly, it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken.	3.3011828344721175
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.	3.033153799423635
The fact that administrative expenditure on INTERREG III is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise, although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the Commission' s support programmes.	3.0133577288847513
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	2.5523507132075434
Mr Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on Mr Kouchner' s responsibilities, and I would like to make two very important points here. The structure being implemented in Kosovo is under the auspices of the United Nations.	2.5550188234141364
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation.	1.807471199649664
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	2.164757142775077
Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe.	5.811247541117502
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.5188712904074
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	2.5630717895792294
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	3.5688759413609765
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.	3.249341161859085
As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment.	2.6033320897313486
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now.	2.3704468854614915
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation.	2.073320995836403
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	3.137393536599346
The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner.	3.431710358798713
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	2.924920526954655
We have made our views very clear to them.	2.413322699586839
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever.	3.8009846375388547
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States.	2.4076929421009496
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop, it will also have social and economic benefits and, at the same time, public health standards will improve.	2.8119005857293398
It is important that, in time, there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries.	4.033212893441724
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!	2.7013452684439487
We adopt legislation in the European Union.	2.4874053354529844
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	2.4517252964906304
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role.	2.490949535540406
In any case, this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon.	2.128616567766649
Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years.	3.070716312844312
. Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy.	3.094906324580591
It is, however, very much in doubt whether Brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the Israeli and Syrian authorities require from their peace patron, the United States, not to mention the heavy, equally costly, security guarantees in case of an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.	2.4093792367474043
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	2.8834470499903118
It is not enough that all the world' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme, as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries.	2.6973342394269624
Resumption of the session	1.7491832698293113
This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104.	2.085757880528933
We need to provide alternative answers, otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe' s positive roles in history.	2.305325541798983
In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date.	2.6062897501845486
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.	1.8604827270529496
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	2.5133523276295358
I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick.	3.0710342552726493
Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him.	2.87402786542855
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives, duly accredited, travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared.	1.7130762918223268
Mr Rübig has the floor.	2.90748970686965
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people.	3.04393025344912
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at.	3.679021124990072
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders.	2.1789626269826075
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports.	2.577436785226908
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Five months are provided for this.	1.7034959507277718
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April.	3.902252256946979
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	2.8251101644127576
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work.	2.7098056035549773
The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full.	2.6109441165054967
With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept.	3.7139652094211675
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	3.0957801480118867
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	2.5531944430296236
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands.	2.9235841214004603
Why should this be the case?	4.394244947243101
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner. This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today.	3.650503041554304
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	2.5104333014093876
The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge.	2.645415826741322
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references.	2.9197211905528264
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area; the new and positive conditions which have been created, in very many cases on Greece' s initiative.	2.544556418238685
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution.	2.606937119616218
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum.	2.580915465622612
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	2.2940931049185207
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European.	3.293439837574737
I am very much hoping in the next few months that the Commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out, among other things, that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in China or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the European Union.	3.2183340420160222
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	4.2251810294091285
In addition, there is a clear tendency, in matters of international jurisdiction, more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction.	2.9865562268297214
Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form.	3.3123317268307835
The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	3.107435763429866
Women belong to different social classes.	1.5346630981880847
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	2.397951152136702
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning.	2.7873639018385203
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many.	3.295554706075558
Here, in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the Pre-Accession Pact, it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the European Union and the Russian Federation, a plan which is now being finalised, and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the Member States, in Moscow, and to develop a set of further initiatives.	3.4577848572165695
There are a number of sound amendments.	3.614766279577629
Resumption of the sitting	6.994230363640949
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union' s financial programmes and instruments.	4.032048262665216
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	2.9009297793530315
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	4.922623812713541
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management.	3.125593151798301
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	4.231999777542531
Firstly, I would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of Member States, although I am very much in favour of having such a debate, for my regular viewing of British television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system.	2.978328018504272
On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent.	2.986344101666613
A new government has come into power in Austria, comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities.	2.3453769331841396
Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas.	2.4026588576605925
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy.	2.3460479325006305
And it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the European Union, recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base, with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access, on equal terms, and in which our citizens can have real confidence.	2.65739398817817
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made.	2.5119704013857422
We will be looking at the extent to which we can create an equilateral policy triangle combining economic policy, employment policy and social policy.	3.311738558618354
These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie.	1.5138921516302226
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	2.0043767863814956
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made.	3.4653333786475904
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	2.4393161386308257
That is not the route that has been taken.	5.328377078261901
Thank you for your answer.	2.710569598892444
The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State.	2.225039443912229
As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within.	3.1799380083442546
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	1.7269991671250944
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	1.9914301887746075
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment.	3.420643530211062
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.	1.9225482425701046
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed.	2.530709413786504
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	2.750056564585891
. (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive.	2.8590807157624663
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	2.794328624511214
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Monica Frassoni' s report, according to which the European Parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the Commission about the implementing provisions for the Council' s decision of 28 June 1999 concerning comitology.	3.438467440484634
Mr President, this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights.	3.302523948090766
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this.	4.769878291366382
Indeed, these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions, people who cannot return to their homes after the storms, purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist. They are no longer there, having been swept away in the torrents.	2.2807895801194045
The first principle means creating a new 'pact' between farmers and society, making the farmer 'steward of the countryside' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside' s recreation value.	2.530796157497139
It is never easy working on comitology.	1.5571210901810975
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs?	1.7308981551971214
These measures do, in fact, entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years' imprisonment.	2.3044143960858547
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally.	3.607848322483152
In a debate, there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said.	4.465686207756787
So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	2.9492209437401526
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	2.305121848891013
Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it.	1.9997928348226168
In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland.	4.620302446126783
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on.	2.297384673728445
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation.	3.370961315684715
We call on everyone, within and outside Kosovo, to support these common aims, to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them.	2.359838257107182
In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic.	2.1313333776483803
Congratulations on your maiden speech: It went really well.	1.4636818294934597
In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into.	2.825565067320914
The European Parliament' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation.	3.215867451248346
Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means.	3.0184590672219747
In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament.	3.086567704043609
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	1.9261550617608798
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre.	2.3814447474847293
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too.	2.4558145772792264
There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen.	3.220881743372066
It happened to sink there, and Brittany, where I come from, should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula, and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks.	2.9540899012209247
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection.	2.266413252705188
We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content.	2.744674209435927
In this context, in committee we regretted the paltry funding allotted to rural development and supported the amendments calling for an increased budget for this Community initiative so that it matches the previous LEADER I and LEADER II initiatives.	2.491651144140014
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives.	1.968339790412353
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme.	4.0698543665074896
We agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that, despite the rules laid down in the sixth Steel Aid Code, the Commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that Code.	3.007970887703867
This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming.	3.3977406339893834
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate.	2.838382284475836
We have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring, often affecting the lives of large numbers of European people.	2.4479896979976496
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive.	2.5774829239415635
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe.	1.9065844905340033
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan.	3.1833618899344494
Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations.	2.698153734397871
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	2.7580636190594188
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union.	1.979092250764958
When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen.	4.003277621141462
Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict.	4.2330560833868365
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission.	3.289128746463866
That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	3.032927626964383
I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups.	3.004904663339891
We do drink port wine, and we do like German beer, and we even use Finnish saunas, but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat.	2.919447245139343
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.	2.6201708996355513
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution.	2.3907007935735463
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time.	1.9402065488203304
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	2.280795653907509
In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise.	2.827586790261678
Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident.	4.708822253037438
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress.	2.2849536281883966
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report, I have this important reservation.	3.9096200994339196
Tens of thousands of people are on the run.	3.5368106126272227
May he rest in peace.	1.3909282794809021
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	3.4598996705250418
In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island.	4.399626038391931
Thank you, Mr Lannoye.	6.840071310478563
So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same.	3.256042847807346
Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response.	3.0875520552426363
The women' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light.	2.2596826254304356
That is a reduction of 3¾ % compared with the previous CIs.	3.377946931605205
Finally, as our Nobel Prize Winner, José Saramago, has said, we are all in each other and as Jesus Christ said, although Saramago disagreed with this, we should not just love one another, more importantly, we should respect one another.	2.8914818954815487
There have already been hundreds of deaths.	2.7708483653204112
That is what Culture 2000 represents.	2.946681702339621
Thirdly, because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals.	2.498337013598962
Most of the technical issues have been resolved.	2.496314356434337
Do not continue in this vein!	3.4121674584631196
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	2.9347097642311546
My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process.	3.3141020371356467
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	2.5203619970853377
In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries.	2.460028460641581
Our older people, even though on social welfare, can enjoy the benefits of travel.	2.2787832775130985
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables.	6.122625867299159
In this first speech, I would like to share with Parliament the Commission' s view of the most important events in 1999.	3.9736810303788115
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion.	3.846442142312797
They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union.	2.333766269874048
Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly.	3.2504400006113094
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo, especially as regards judicial structures and police cover.	2.328842996125718
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999.	1.9277122012036747
In my opinion, Angola is a test case.	2.6807498370624536
In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric.	3.1439138962232804
When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope.	3.608943740118589
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	2.7408306387457926
A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of.	3.666613772736217
We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency.	3.051878073988339
That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council.	3.5142710813755396
In particular, the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site.	4.517989797267795
The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council.	4.153845542205845
We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects.	3.625303125927588
Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation.	2.5024246513561663
He stated: "Contradictions in policy can lead to balance."	2.0391113834417536
The President of Parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal, and my colleague, the Minister for Justice, and I therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week.	3.231575187603232
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	2.822410740721659
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources.	3.2142838516199843
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid.	3.4197321093637534
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	3.05011696592592
.	77.3301660757284
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you.	2.7934302954129917
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve.	2.756412087831926
We support that.	1.8094339796221799
In fact, Article 86 of the EC Treaty, formerly Article 90, stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them.	2.451172019803877
Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front.	3.311008437166477
I might also ask: when do you anticipate that they will be in place?	2.77700793686918
Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.	1.8429567697106592
Before the final vote:	3.7886433952987915
Furthermore, I will not withhold my support but will endeavour, alongside my fellow MEPs, to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation.	2.639386835252894
So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention.	2.146577935519079
If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions.	5.145446553747379
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it.	2.0585379411263967
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	3.531881156820284
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups.	2.096320688878689
He should never have been able to escape from France, but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve.	2.069792908745282
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today.	3.7696131864452553
Secondly, I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness.	3.3939696396566172
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan?	1.6789597301536674
On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe.	2.7354707244875387
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	3.044240900528589
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas.	2.7663097115794653
But if we are to believe the environmental movements, even this is vain hope.	2.3062375049146664
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally.	1.77734909299899
I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular.	3.6813239024726143
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise.	3.6297031465061425
The form the aid takes is important.	1.6493485359414426
After all, innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding.	2.0457487549604516
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets.	1.8877113210032925
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States, in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution.	3.0835023961126033
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective?	4.581164640249315
I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago.	1.6400883831592818
In the case of Turkey it is different.	2.7475001385817457
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	2.9904734046278407
Oz' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press.	1.660312140010112
Adjournment of the session	1.4992999455679814
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London.	1.945508372548287
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank.	2.0522471562424873
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	2.477060779245316
Two types of measure are required for this purpose. The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration.	2.39711222843878
All decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the Community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like Andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents. I am referring, for example, to the lack of agreement with Morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry, part of whose fleet is moored in Almería.	2.85273394921661
If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?	2.3613898174403176
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.	2.780162630748917
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific.	2.8315613758765004
Thank you, Mr Nogueira, for your explanation.	4.239819606442392
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples?	2.077849722959299
That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition.	2.3028605939157307
It is very important that we include liability in that process.	2.689722445527998
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first.	3.329847240263153
The system currently in force creates transparency, affords enterprises legal certainty and has, without a shadow of a doubt, led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement.	2.111736714819673
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people.	2.869959632687803
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	1.9384535552796462
All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.5561385008638533
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration.	2.584082463774715
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management.	2.746855833907781
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	3.2304177512210708
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	1.96602364025373
They know full well that they should not commit these acts.	2.405556679280683
Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime.	2.487420647962403
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	2.2988420766013102
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council.	2.4009894508545533
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	2.166076049518425
I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis.	2.3249417514133865
Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions.	2.8397010492375365
Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy.	3.2217037703704876
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism.	2.3061947807741143
Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council.	5.085004276146715
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates.	2.54425040538541
As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: "The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO' s unity.	2.5992522899202086
We do not want financial control to be abolished.	3.231154422979812
In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave.	2.479944928759897
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	2.706883546641551
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks.	3.2305507798229303
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility.	2.1776656159014753
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits, the positive aspects of competition.	2.752661795469386
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related.	4.098615337258503
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	2.306589232886971
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	2.9952596595766376
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say, and I think that they are right, then to take up another six months of the Commission' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible.	3.1303746718479784
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost, they should also take back end-of-life vehicles.	3.1116184096357076
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.	3.0750967805308695
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support.	1.841293169945864
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	2.8966281514470005
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model.	3.194746262329716
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not.	1.8396914113640166
It is not an old one, it was issued in 1997.	4.15961322198737
Do not take too long to send it back.	2.0063579328988075
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.	2.3546410559742728
My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this.	3.709450023146013
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise.	3.0086060080845134
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments.	2.3641912987410776
The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)].	2.2381385120914925
We could not agree more with the latter.	2.175085318506542
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	2.717504291605895
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours.	3.0069821954615246
Mr President, I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen, which concerns aid to the steel industry.	4.491990328769769
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur.	3.0541837429715644
Only, the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped.	3.293982705534565
We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place.	3.270472667700038
Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy.	3.091835992743658
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union.	2.870459691582134
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	3.094966983762149
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	2.0194238295642903
We have to act now, before it is too late.	3.321278861836678
However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past.	3.162448583713239
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	3.257984558715842
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom, moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty.	2.1748570813363397
Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money.	2.3446499719219407
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions.	2.601473233885745
Mr President, the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East.	3.5756029884681726
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.	2.4338988410577405
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that.	2.7416238853029546
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal.	3.182473010996175
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed.	2.018010832523258
The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations.	2.8749497529983588
Our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest, and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood.	2.0348802234351298
The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship.	3.0616782821575272
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years.	2.229364634288345
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks.	2.2767387346370707
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	3.668003229334132
Now, a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament.	2.677959680029709
To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal.	2.828821137944338
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000)	1.4195369900373849
On the first question, I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package.	2.969215696259953
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	3.400623263784436
Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards.	2.6970154842064393
On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki.	1.9665675623511085
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur.	4.075893295443992
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita.	2.5177674334502016
At the Commission' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies, Member States and the European Parliament, a number of exceptions have been made.	3.410467665081491
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	3.8800422239256487
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts.	3.4113677806296945
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.	2.7185117740468208
But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough.	3.460904678019498
I just have one more request.	1.9604911987963685
The Commission gives no soul to Europe.	1.5797489965499747
When we discuss the TSE regulation, Commissioner, we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under Article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation, such as cosmetics, medicinal products or animal feed.	2.8511431045812903
We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local.	2.163484132932262
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade.	2.9175915876520047
We need to have a long memory when we say: " for once we are united, at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned, and will not play one off against the other in the European Union."	3.022136808664472
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.	2.4287900408152074
In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union' s role in terms of copyright.	3.890895043927107
For example, at least in the countries which I know well, I doubt that the intention, repeated three or four times in the Commission document, to reform 'Europe' s social protection, health care and pension systems ...in a climate of more cautious public spending' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back.	2.797214202452833
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics?	2.251571399141222
Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised.	2.2524513902053207
Mr President, first and foremost, I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment, both surface water and groundwater, is probably one of our most important duties of all.	3.196554693566859
Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service.	4.679164407601841
That is usually the case.	1.5583412698881294
Mr President, the Israeli author, Amos Oz, managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently.	2.5182941018105915
Quality products in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies.	3.015591923566695
Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers.	3.074352252077547
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	2.5644745369871407
It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration.	2.6250829940849845
Things could well continue in the same way.	2.0576530537675795
On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government.	2.2517528834920855
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3573064339158158
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied, but then only a tiny bit.	1.887660459348763
Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors.	2.0384448803335125
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo.	2.2159459955518614
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	3.813263464547915
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	2.478512316629234
Firstly, no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country.	2.6100184043733226
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer.	2.72998032685512
Pursuant to Article 3(8) of the Directive, terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the 'collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory'.	2.5878780599510676
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers.	2.954465619881084
This is not new.	11.073667335318483
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies.	1.9671267866317652
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States.	2.435860358978803
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured.	4.048387291253691
At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition.	3.010181303697642
In my opinion, this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too.	4.312270282403218
I regret that the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments, despite the fact that I am fully aware of the views and commitment of Parliament, the Agricultural Committee and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on these issues.	3.9142316327691846
I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders.	2.0631224562686943
I am not, personally, a blinkered militant in favour of monopolies, whether public or private, but when I see the results achieved by private firms in this sector I am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service!	2.9014945866282367
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	2.915296822045597
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision.	2.4816418999103727
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	4.178425535898298
Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself.	2.8674065184616335
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions.	3.841425724480264
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	2.3876026606651264
I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss.	2.4596686936087204
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned.	3.23076575414657
This is no longer tolerable.	3.040826534221351
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.	3.2292588724880407
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination.	2.3313568825912308
I hope for their adoption.	2.121155308450864
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	1.7026447180660464
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	3.2835377747602217
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	2.1399907055453458
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation?	2.5698085668551744
So far, as you know, this has proved unsuccessful, and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary.	3.8103566892778367
Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his statement.	4.848002083002113
I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required.	3.2367655644695246
I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening.	3.325892517740376
Since 1991, the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia.	3.69781338706093
What else can we do to support this opposition?	2.803262475093605
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	2.526896692343249
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil.	2.3255426043145615
Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children.	6.010885189402052
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	2.2656477626208744
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind.	3.2394544591898486
With regard to Schengen, without wishing to trespass on the territory of the Council, or more precisely the incorporation of the Schengen acquis into the Community framework, I would like to stress, on the topical subject of restoring border controls, that the Commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention in order to reinforce its authority.	3.3652028517517616
Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense.	2.717838576637231
Actually, I hear less and less about this.	1.9849930672502678
I have repeatedly emphasised that, indeed not just as a Commissioner, but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning.	2.7834637883666877
These possibilities should be fully exploited.	2.1471106163153557
You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something.	3.833287858234971
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential.	2.6427989472010256
Firstly, the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet, but, furthermore, there are certain questions to be borne in mind.	4.349649276093268
Once again, the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce.	3.7759341503280095
When we submitted our report, we referred to the risks posed by growth.	2.351742528870405
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament, Mr Gasòliba.	3.453833496452792
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	4.606867097164135
Something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so-called European model into a parody.	2.12046943519543
A number of codes have since been introduced.	3.4355242909106587
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	1.825058109398904
But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol.	2.7197332644457473
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	2.3189741626263016
This is what we should be concerned about here today.	4.440184992963736
Natural habitats were destroyed.	1.2947247862665763
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.	3.215850616930392
Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism.	2.8907954843849324
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people, on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases, on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk, on the provision of seeds and tools, on food security, on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters.	3.332734050930749
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them.	3.7956432308029147
I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda.	3.0782120158143322
Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out.	1.946153512250054
So far, some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes, while others have not.	2.3103180129010283
It is clear, of course, that in many ways the really hard work starts now, with the implementation of our proposals.	4.088233792650621
Storms in Europe	422.52561672691434
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined.	4.198977164490727
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	2.9730269916947316
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	1.6131815926064388
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone.	2.047370658632466
Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention.	3.508680512926872
In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens.	2.894827711811351
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals.	2.114310201205297
As Parliament, we are, of course, expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this, which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten, as has almost happened already.	3.101988662617815
We are extremely disappointed.	2.6063407812678756
We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic.	2.5886929767151834
Report (A5-0007/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)0003 - C5-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD))	2.042715029837029
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission' s social programme.	2.4783609830612683
Turning briefly to Angola, we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches, especially from Mr Soares, with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject.	2.5810082340214064
Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity.	3.4554467126453505
Mr President of the Commission, it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe.	3.9197478454975885
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding.	4.302690275508831
The conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric, including infrastructure, public and private services and so on.	2.4048316148467523
Beyond this, I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected.	3.189388815856563
The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time.	3.1719667443402924
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.	3.3734481426852434
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	2.308303885881742
We need stronger banking supervision.	1.273372145356381
Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous dire quelque chose!	3.0180753492641332
For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian.	2.375357833071828
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d' Yeu or elsewhere, if Japan, Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch?	2.6515906388269066
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code.	2.4944712054649862
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that.	2.550425397597382
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned.	3.6108091997167997
This is why specific action for women is needed, as well as mainstreaming.	3.707198927112864
Mr President, the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the Member States work together to protect groundwater, drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing EU environmental legislation.	3.970599684264903
The bet before us is a bet with time.	1.7856309451423733
With regard more specifically to your question, I would like to highlight the fact that it only makes sense to have a new statute if it represents progress in comparison with the current situation and if it ensures that holders of identical posts are as far as possible treated in the same way.	2.700880451849368
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.)	1.9798514587732368
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	4.670828228144915
Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts.	2.481097196397289
My group's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster, just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions.	2.7480465498581927
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor.	3.8119558157269298
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.	2.590023048565995
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board.	3.114022366360135
I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain.	7.6252312587003805
VOTE	21.75018985665072
That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks.	6.269612066106278
This kind of situation should not be allowed.	4.670866707149255
On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts.	2.673935940259781
Mr President, the fact that the different groups in this Parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution, in this ever controversial debate, which is the result of a broad consensus, seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes.	3.6979381413107837
Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service.	3.0880304831804612
What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues.	4.107688775719061
Regarding URBAN, I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention, first of all, the selection procedure.	2.703127054825889
Agreement on comitology	706.5631119519398
The Agenda 2000 issues are, of course, ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives, the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life.	2.3154000702438444
We want more than that, however.	3.0273171709612687
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start.	1.6647859061135284
First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	3.548599538366283
They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria.	2.074246605873583
It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF.	3.0902536617202765
Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union.	2.9484312505673156
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules.	2.7549564128862323
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions.	3.8653475185843003
This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made.	4.128087247212717
Mr Marinos, we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency, and therefore, the cultural dimension is, I am sure you will appreciate, one of our main concerns.	3.5214055675677836
Together with Mrs Attwooll, I am in favour of collecting scientific data, and of fair and accurate checks, on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations. I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists, like Professor Aubert, or others, that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton, the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers, which have a much greater effect than human influence.	2.891598481395312
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	2.529401552109229
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	4.432157725528117
However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi.	2.3888556223512896
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that.	2.8524413827053037
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	3.5053187704542648
Can you tell us your position on this subject?	3.6397142781061818
I say quite emphatically, even after the report by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is completely involved in the whole idea, that animal feeding, animal rearing, animal production must be suited to the species and must also, above all, cause no harm or danger to human beings.	2.295020225314559
The Netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or, in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around, the manufacturer, has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with ecology; it is a simple question of competition!	2.8639186234231193
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	2.247589160134257
It is, therefore, with good reason that we bring this up here today.	3.0162404589794756
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	2.0256698144268057
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability.	1.7638058524773146
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration.	2.784248098930298
It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	2.4402626794708673
A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short.	3.3465595463108953
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	3.411911751993621
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment.	3.101351031057346
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	2.0215200610352326
Commissioner, thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer, which has been rigorous and well-argued.	2.7766200813199857
Mr President, I do not think we are in a position to throw stones at the Eastern European countries which have come knocking at the door of the European Union, because ecological disasters occur as much here, in the west, as they do in the east.	3.5328484576821153
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	1.7240988406883733
Having said this, our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents. This invites the Commission to present a report within six months.	2.739380256924189
Mr President, Commissioner, before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I would like to share with you three basic factors which, in my opinion, determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment.	2.8674682679968915
However, housing is specifically excluded.	1.3716722017490577
I therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand B: 'integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions' , so as to cover, in what I think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions.	2.27664028595583
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	3.180172270818302
We deplore the fact that the Commission, in its opinion of 26 January, limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised Europe enlarging towards the East, a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions.	2.6256290745731583
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential.	2.3711180178430626
As the report itself indicates, the funds allocated to the URBAN II programme for the 2000-2006 period are approximately 30% less than those in the previous period, which were already low, at EUR 900 million. Added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of Europe which is pathetic when practically all European city districts, both suburban and inner city, are affected.	2.6953653407362714
Although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio-economic sectors of the territory concerned, government officials must be involved at decision-making level, whether they come from the municipalities, departments, regions or national governments.	2.132852991899523
As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives.	2.8844263912917705
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark.	2.1076384353600592
However, Madam President, these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow, and which the Socialists will vote in favour of, will put in place one of the European Union' s most important programmes.	3.8125943243876246
This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union.	2.344553251446318
Consequently, I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	3.059900603659887
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	2.988292729834027
This condition of accrual is essential since, in my opinion, the principle of nulla poena sine lege, legality in criminal law, must be observed.	3.236127793764238
As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	2.943994192319013
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity.	2.7245266022118844
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee.	2.430084273564508
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes.	3.2830898576993643
We need, therefore, to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives, to address, not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy, the apathy which you identify.	2.46916104842877
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	1.890342549391156
In brief, this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters.	2.385425661919719
So when we talk now about the need to involve the Northern Cyprus community in exchanges of information, particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution.	3.230012698361618
Relating to Friday: President.	1.6578619209144791
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole.	3.1222461390571468
This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.	2.3927127692177006
Question No 39 by (H-0036/00):	1.1672026996941478
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match.	1.866682881929321
In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium.	3.9598626449846104
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast.	2.9137586393406254
Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting.	2.858494468805803
Are you aware of this?	3.2535197364777533
I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government.	3.501329899018391
With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission.	4.14360708308841
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies, unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced.	2.1994133665572404
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	2.6152112697421073
This is not the case here.	6.170872453242211
Since Tampere, there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent.	2.2647325028335685
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	3.4975962471175612
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable; it is in violation of the European Treaty (Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam).	4.016274209495449
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious.	2.279449118441879
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	2.2352765889434174
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio, and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection.	3.513133643026804
The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	2.555754315968084
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council.	3.516535822538676
The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties.	2.98842511979984
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia.	4.929521610984677
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	2.773367146649525
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	2.768051307932675
Change will have to come in any case, change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another.	2.5195103758274078
Thank you for your attention.	4.306862007373818
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	2.137961224201362
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?	3.7385084061511207
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	2.7271555376808903
Fifthly, with the pending enlargement, I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game.	2.95741185783564
Mr President, will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds?	3.8350156682135386
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	3.9779890048313242
.	77.3301660757284
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	2.3547776329439585
Stand by universality and affordability!	1.5066422674483946
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	2.5889361168936875
According to the Council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force, whereas Parliament's Committee on the Environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years.	2.826730424247172
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	4.837545601053077
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action.	1.9389678261492498
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism.	2.3073152439095708
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	2.0616298926119456
That is the goal which we have to work towards.	7.129137079232984
Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane.	2.4442223584754363
Mr President, Mr Fischler, my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues, as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen.	2.871778676026949
Finally, a word on INTERREG.	2.477393322350699
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	1.9185276100868254
A fault confessed is half redressed.	1.524761983250269
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely.	2.6648387617696914
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims, alimony claims and non-contested claims.	1.9027216761978882
The best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before Parliament at the moment, as well as the legislation in the pipeline, rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in Directive 90/220 may not be fully taken into account.	2.774435868579905
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another.	2.0592619507550567
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome: the public nature and confidentiality of documents.	3.2544859993013167
We know what the problem is: instability on the markets as the result of speculation.	2.745095434803355
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	2.792057623153184
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	1.4677452456078997
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women.	2.601894762536116
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	2.2417701192595736
The time for resolutions has passed.	2.366968482060804
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.	3.282426101197953
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements.	2.8012399222587114
Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed.	3.5420587387989717
It is Europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster.	2.730062368057244
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.	2.619400709474641
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets.	2.241916028476291
In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone.	3.780718266370901
When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems.	2.186056616886437
In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation.	1.9506772721141772
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either, of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone.	2.2459690030497974
In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system.	2.7576020492838818
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact.	3.0393310006730663
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application.	4.442403818428654
We have beef exported to southern Africa, to Namibia and South Africa, which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland, so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union.	1.9493721329999651
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work.	5.421845895880243
Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade.	4.566062589350279
The project has been long and problematic.	1.9375989652433372
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud, less overheads, more transparency and more democracy.	2.26594746431423
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans.	3.0960006860311178
But all is not lost.	1.6848277792429738
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that.	2.9950885238622647
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope.	1.6154240819432646
However, the Council should also bear in mind that, if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime, we do not only need to widen Europol' s remit, as decided at Tampere; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities.	3.0820516183644737
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	2.0059074228156812
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.	1.578846222177601
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly.	3.8363343431417003
The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations.	1.8274493404907302
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations, I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two.	3.4253015739142123
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100% public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership, even under cover of environmental protection.	1.9597500200993758
Question No 35 by (H-0778/99):	1.2605856117352525
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate.	3.8082455727089446
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	2.7953211267567415
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.	3.3836403139704005
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC.	3.2615873851930717
The Swedish Christian Democrats would emphasise the value of the European Union' s and the European Parliament' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction.	2.688480633382055
We do not accept this agreement, which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks.	3.4704246019635603
Until we have a firm position, we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities.	3.4871301564508914
It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues.	3.5715547232116736
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	3.368815117688202
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	3.513418531773314
I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work.	2.573622502078302
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe.	1.6924959056494793
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation.	2.2656848194651302
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it.	3.2058568663375806
I therefore wonder whether the Community should not have a more drastic change of tack and, based on very strict evaluations, change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively.	2.4099928388067955
Although there has been some slippage, I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon.	2.761871430708877
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union.	3.3698976041471145
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed.	2.2944834751702534
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	3.1453084069726556
What do they see about the relationships between human beings?	1.8754324048537034
We need, in our judgement, to focus on a package of measures including: first, the introduction of effective, anti-discrimination legislation at Union level; second, implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non-Member States to promote, in practical terms, the integration of the immigrant population in Member States' societies; third, the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion.	2.834137848043695
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions "outwards" , it also applies between the institutions.	3.5996013074786206
I know that this service is unprofitable.	3.3782004887173462
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	2.604338095147355
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	2.6857754148423987
Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives.	2.388172992104694
They say that if you want something done, it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea, the fishermen, must be very attentive.	3.380930673909861
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late.	2.316756366660939
By now they are far away.	1.904799609668021
We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission.	3.494264455838952
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	2.799487050913832
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second.	4.101739048452065
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	2.9488287652644636
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	2.6939893845975127
It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime.	2.7366228824190535
The first concerns the product, that is to say the funds.	3.263293709909224
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m.)	1.7766779832409494
Mr President, as Mr Van Hecke rightly pointed out, this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples, and Parliament must speak up, especially vis-à-vis good friends, and the United States is a good friend.	4.547042701409025
In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	3.1223090364642783
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	3.7128949116961842
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen.	3.1847015019105083
This question should be answered in light of the fact that the age-old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of courier companies and by technological developments, such as fax and e-mail.	2.339295523405077
In recent years, the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably, increasing the risk of accidents.	3.016193622166048
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.	3.9697499827438203
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	2.926221343958758
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600.	3.699797719959083
The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives.	2.3880299002130796
Indeed, what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice, that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights, if it transpires that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries?	3.326431379014878
It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union.	2.7637781174484086
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	1.9310880363325986
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	2.164854409111277
A very important proposal indeed.	4.261139579050675
Finally, on the subject of technical assistance, on which your rapporteur and several of you commented. It goes without saying that the Commission will adhere to the terms of Article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance, if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general.	3.2489741352049015
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically, because each period is different, we have failed to learn the lessons of history.	2.7190678584603365
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard.	3.5810152838625755
However, there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime. A year ago, we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up.	2.508302385297682
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues.	2.3107712955745585
At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets.	3.0611920784622297
I can perform this dual task.	1.3925661560351537
A French-owned ship, under a Maltese flag of convenience, an Indian crew, a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy, in Sicily, with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria, I think.	2.364496381157719
Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator.	2.2662433879341135
On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs.	2.3771766940857875
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102.	3.1235395939128874
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome.	3.0464703319385467
However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis.	2.1762822888218873
I believe that we should be pleased about this.	5.212306221862056
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage.	2.8344904169410934
I agree that an investigation system should be introduced, but I am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and, in any case, the equal need for the right to a defence.	3.8209572149718127
In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances.	2.3352810830739243
By now, my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice.	2.755153527805544
Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer.	4.228480161083654
I would like to explain our thinking here.	4.492345269299041
Question No 45 by (H-0041/00):	1.1672026996941478
It is before Parliament for second reading.	2.2460603016033804
This is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap.	2.9110416610735697
This is the crux of the matter.	3.433444851626867
The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal.	3.6934909745980233
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report, the first of which was to be discussed in 1998.	4.04470767008788
For example, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about 'long-term capital for long-term projects' - this is an obvious issue.	2.922755034792184
The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless.	2.8440341674493963
So far, social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources.	3.4161022369379705
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	2.7166100232958947
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	2.762463949356609
Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market.	3.0399992288004256
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union.	3.4236881250725277
Intergovernmental Conference	108.26223250601986
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases.	1.6328374080153198
We are taking legal advice.	2.4191369943342815
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span.	2.9392193575558623
That is scandalous, their case ought to be heard.	2.59829404287715
Arrested and released in Madrid, he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon.	2.0971409816473394
Madam President, the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one.	5.342238158464663
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment.	1.6481399904112466
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late.	3.105277255867247
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	3.3060910002073927
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.	4.406592850081432
Now, more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south, the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges.	2.3456454490196417
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met. These countries include Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.	3.1752429475200876
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital.	2.2133345307350814
I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy.	3.433538833338021
I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first?	2.2796269206101143
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this.	1.8401583925418739
This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations.	2.916209028360804
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.	1.5162531909723307
Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux.	2.787969968162438
If the Commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the European Union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of EU citizens.	3.0745368036864327
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less?	4.193322144318386
It marks the beginning, rather than the end, of a process.	4.343230741835389
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House.	2.220968329126355
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation.	2.1775579106220473
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	2.6378093758002246
I have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the European Commission at the time, and I am also coming across documents from Post-Europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect.	3.074596023336432
On the common agricultural policy, the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms.	2.951484970978111
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation.	3.780570745045271
Instead, communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems, using EU resources as a value added to local actions.	1.803458213950825
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past.	1.636035242077861
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	2.6158493919458334
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts.	2.797902633108258
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain.	3.7477938893462537
(FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy.	3.052795287712207
It is to take new ideas and try them out in LEADER, with the participants on the ground, with the local organisations on the ground, with many non-governmental organisations, with the churches, with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities.	3.0079668309823204
Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation.	2.197734168585029
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence.	2.3454171576221263
Some may be better than others, and some worse.	2.184740497812526
Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues.	3.4123441357810043
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006.	1.4220073587136495
On paper!	449.0601111516776
On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that Turkey' s application for membership of the European Union may lead to greater flexibility in Ankara' s position on this.	3.0024393616385345
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms, which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south, at the hands of the multinationals.	2.5782715895438524
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.	2.272033650216925
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	3.5570428771477043
But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual.	2.9286327053151955
Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing.	3.0647114450467834
In addition, I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood, especially where Community contributions are concerned, should incentivise.	2.7625060312331677
Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming.	4.030962816467449
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact.	2.47022475168906
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	2.9578536758208736
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources.	3.2744033059442206
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	1.6063975366330314
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.	3.5219582270864254
It groups them together and that is very important.	4.302562373085323
But here too, within the European Union, expectations are high.	3.841701274579595
These include, for example, costs and transfers.	3.2322736822339677
We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations.	2.4625469719012787
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September.	2.2942993674485024
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation.	3.3396661016652165
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ?	2.2348639201244147
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media.	2.4619574512202775
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	2.0400228073747066
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice.	5.074074845830015
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	1.938566107203169
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	3.9040499780803914
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	3.7314042126484797
Question No 40 by (H-0095/00):	1.1672026996941478
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened.	1.7707185173461213
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.746577876805691
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	3.627485885387312
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	2.9659937312010904
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.	2.982251853282576
And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content.	3.7830349296848547
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes.	3.0109931528605856
(FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers.	2.730897745798425
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed.	2.6018461437086753
We are seeking to implement best practice.	2.1034579011240333
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	2.198766168621973
In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies, so that it could form an opinion, and asked the European confederations of hotel-and-restaurant owners and tourist agencies, HOTREC and ECTAA, to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them.	2.890328820580194
In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the "Women' s World Marches" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day.	2.4991172666776165
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought.	2.4303610153967794
In this respect we wish you every success. However, we are also aware of our role as the Commission' s watchdog.	4.4003337904256075
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable.	3.0850051935778273
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann' s work on this matter.	2.960152045971989
Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark.	3.0987346297589484
The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples.	2.5434800957158226
We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties.	3.244832974867931
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated.	2.692720394366025
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive.	6.460668427221145
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	1.749882617232163
Welcome	21.75018985665072
It is time for action.	4.161503149392822
The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community.	2.1474360153768908
Let us call this a negative tender franchise.	1.7065693340321288
But there has been nothing for a year.	3.149106312816782
One example is water transfers.	1.8068304023558497
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us.	2.0491306202160273
Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.6097421486004473
As a corollary, there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations.	4.217472788955368
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	3.6072973673941564
As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation.	3.3138460732233264
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	3.7965191278865085
However, this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives.	3.1717112719220064
This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union.	3.146274781589377
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge, and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people' s health.	3.5351951345423593
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation" .	3.3677597808349105
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.	1.479022260369153
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles, one which are still, unfortunately, outside the European Parliament and the Commission.	3.097694536602903
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility.	3.587492316490309
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted, and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards.	1.936029480790766
Justice needs to be done in East Timor.	4.477289567459093
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region.	3.0846180416360927
We have to ensure that our ECOFIN ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in Europe which is creative, has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens.	3.057152684574023
The other parties are not paying.	1.5457355891357734
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee.	3.204485589382767
The point is: does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions?	2.1701393660351815
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency.	1.7051250744327116
Yet, the sum of EUR 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999, was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even rudimentary civilised conditions in Kosovo, especially where the provision of health services is concerned.	2.344698233365228
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future.	2.930636915342301
Mr President, this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today, namely that the Conference of Presidents open to Members, which was scheduled for 23 February, has now been cancelled.	3.3007699108147937
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	3.1994257780707334
It should not be in the amendment.	7.318000769577943
Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power.	2.8314933454142253
The previous speaker already said something about this.	2.215832165612651
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.	4.846159354351712
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door.	3.9403384785866935
This report contains 34 conclusions, including 15 calls to the Commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection, particularly in outermost and island regions.	2.582280793169717
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do.	2.888043750734515
Before the vote at the plenary sitting, new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee.	2.8679129948349593
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.	4.288997092184665
I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	3.171950795858786
However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.	2.483112777371337
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists, including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press.	2.354712516739901
The Commission, in my opinion, has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated.	3.560885638687788
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment.	2.3518507304631475
This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo.	2.2369528398830103
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation.	1.7436364978858359
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too.	2.002000857590476
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position.	3.5876337118876807
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	2.303132619136408
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster, at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned, on a par with Chernobyl.	2.9949574165175195
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply.	4.062190679547576
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism.	2.537244432274996
Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market.	4.132098793420405
These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area.	2.985314333690618
As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia.	2.632429792706327
Amendments Nos 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals.	2.266513428416709
They have paid already.	1.502159524610482
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your reply, although I regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet, since this matter is of the greatest importance.	3.1478981575802347
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	1.9560035702706529
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation.	3.0104141947783205
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	1.821285011570995
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up.	3.724717776960602
I urge the House to support these changes.	4.029144034484402
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset.	2.7751087453419805
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management.	1.8909631427336842
I do hope that this will not be necessary.	5.391643768821731
I assume, therefore, that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total, worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance.	3.224974696442852
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	3.506960142288803
We thank you for that.	4.667445377440901
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	3.2158318703601423
Mr President, I would like to offer a few explanations.	3.7514008606149063
Is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of Council members, rather than a vote reflecting the population in Europe which they democratically represent?	2.129902330343408
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.	3.100015139958464
Instead, we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal, to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.	2.3766722168578513
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region.	3.1357854840813837
This question covers several individual matters.	1.3151840444623055
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation.	2.715035739164949
As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real.	2.609380814543409
Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda.	3.726885519547208
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote.	1.5631226306685033
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course.	2.4213683063851366
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders.	3.686942349499094
In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	2.31204955406239
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	3.450414798497128
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago.	2.237865477863944
First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes.	2.497629492505899
The BBC this morning reported that a British Member of this House, holding a senior position within his delegation, continues to offer strategic advice to private clients, but does not state in the Register of Interests who these clients are.	1.8829192999769706
. As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	3.502040182438984
The European Parliament was the first to speak up.	5.921935304692153
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2).	2.362300962236574
They cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, though I must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.	2.698555801417442
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation, provision of shelter, plastic sheeting, jerry cans, blankets, those sorts of things.	2.820734536396321
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one.	2.59937732998481
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	3.642682849518677
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable.	2.809171927153232
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.	2.381327608440845
Valuable experiences were gained, and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone.	2.3779490826890433
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources?	2.5114640850623995
Question No 29 by (H-0786/99):	1.2605856117352525
In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation.	3.080849108923404
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement.	3.339271149509253
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.	2.6318576558029347
That is, after all, a question the people often ask.	3.255879064522558
The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	2.7746241231047195
In its draft guidelines, the Commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past.	2.332836338404217
I am surprised, however, at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy.	4.980844397226067
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings.	2.9242989348675676
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider.	3.311194549258664
It is for this reason that, despite the many omissions in the text, the provisions set out therein could - and I say could, Mr President - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens.	3.087038028689206
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract.	1.8857129265458148
Apart from that, the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we, in the Commission, should go.	3.6655284287883925
We meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others, because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time.	2.7026462584682367
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it.	3.355535381276079
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	2.585206269210658
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	2.455497309048761
Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow.	3.061702661789622
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	3.676803277706163
The smell is absolutely disgusting!	1.6043038704891042
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	2.6951120233049943
In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Confederal Group of the European United Left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion, Mr Nogueira Román, on LEADER.	2.434237314522786
Those could perpetuate an infection.	1.243160499051058
I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House.	2.8569163127298554
However, I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force, bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997.	4.027915749863962
That has never been the intention.	2.692562203896163
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy.	4.420440224822185
This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace.	3.2670263468016856
I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated.	3.264258346973968
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic, but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control, which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment.	3.6740373995680167
Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects.	2.645713987983902
We can see in the incumbent operators, in public post offices, a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers' needs continues.	2.243729843154456
In its communication "Women and Science" , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe.	3.180452130282217
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial.	1.8489087870928398
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union' s common foreign and security policy.	2.4109431723744783
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	3.15726929864001
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	1.9697653953137366
Certainly the Commission will seek good coordination with national employment policies.	2.407474980957602
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners, rather than competitors when it comes to policy.	2.99097803727896
An amendment was therefore made in the committee, but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form.	3.182475600504415
This needs to be said!	10.438077743082637
I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.	2.773734336805715
As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector.	3.174251920650053
But Europe is changing.	2.237757459001282
I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum.	3.8217107630967315
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	2.2062240925029273
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture.	3.8546704666246376
We shall address this problem and check all the translations.	1.932578355624518
Up until now, the Commission' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa.	2.48748078629008
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion.	3.0428739664285414
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	2.150862447095996
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought, particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling.	2.338330293632981
But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission.	1.814734148174335
Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again.	3.917253924700171
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	3.162257963128315
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	2.435731165440094
In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.	1.981005157924506
It has been said before, and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions, that culture is, of course, extremely important as an area unto itself - I would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the European idea.	2.8572597790970886
In any case, the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion: the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime.	1.7451801611406559
In this respect, the Commission supports Amendment No 22, as I have already mentioned.	4.220874520236355
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call "hard law" .	2.0725478418120638
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is 'pretentiously' called autonomous.	2.2142394839799384
This was the opening statement of Commission President, Prodi, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.	3.4867893287792695
There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks.	3.7812571083753035
To that end, the Commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services, the consequences of liberalising cross-border mail and direct mail, the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector, the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process, excluding distribution, and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies.	2.6162406904492643
Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States?	2.926814101203584
In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union.	2.7868538375070653
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned.	2.4113975921071202
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme.	3.1798172819769737
The only way of stopping the diabolical machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit, on pain of compulsory purchase, and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public.	2.5653871504958126
However, the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems.	4.0719839131318505
Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed.	2.299355081812428
Mr President, as the rapporteur said, this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention.	3.695796357696608
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls.	2.9828138441327527
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.	3.1805633208789477
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.	3.2247949845715587
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point.	1.654352402368458
We must win back their faith in EU politics.	1.4531561787988712
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	2.8051450403413387
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	2.8086401947432975
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system.	1.9021292475991822
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	1.733548511722201
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers?	2.6900353729705415
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature.	5.046606266210044
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks.	2.3346720906573037
These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care.	2.5702648373759334
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes?	1.9663251751775683
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	2.6858235997772626
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance, at last, of the ban on degassing at sea.	2.253840597651198
We need, in short, to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these.	2.5776952631699097
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism.	2.318528887519155
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step.	2.602562273337706
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks.	2.3719165939543108
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority.	1.7164123747703195
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	3.2347360918999315
For instance, it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle' s larvae, and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have.	4.331639616183888
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.	3.2299820946045936
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission' s good intentions, but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions.	3.596259323020972
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	2.429701052880987
In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein.	2.8634504646344032
Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for.	2.506556813830248
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	2.68415692074624
All this should make it possible for us, apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them, to confirm the role of 'active frontier' of the Union.	4.226583139555129
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax?	4.074649218027479
. (SV) I cannot support the present resolution because, in paragraph 8, an individual factory in Italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place, while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a European tyre manufacturer.	2.399536640242415
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water?	2.627465757300253
As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo.	2.648777112018619
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	2.392832161140989
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure.	2.4331354399188863
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	3.2768295802421146
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured.	2.6246714325095564
To guarantee transparency and prudence, investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria, for example a transparency requirement and investor protection, are introduced.	1.9364524192259034
These are two of Vice-President Marinho' s ideas and, I believe, they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.	3.427197254112183
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	2.0358376995133267
There can be no democracy without a living parliament.	1.9776959150731903
As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected.	3.5893941999572387
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers.	1.7705793212284802
Moreover, an adequate contribution from different economic sectors, broken down into industrial, household and agricultural sectors, must ensure that this policy is implemented.	2.007077327803077
In particular, we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether.	2.543353958340227
Under the banner of "progress towards transparency" , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public.	2.790666465122011
Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union.	2.5579424514380023
The Council therefore, has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty.	2.458077465022861
Aquaculture should also be monitored.	4.666467230842678
It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission.	2.9324616437982045
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	3.1568189998642127
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects. The Members on the right should note this.	1.9900140029515485
In reaching an agreement with Jörg Haider and his party, the Austrian Christian Democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success.	1.9029281705398113
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	2.7919122993359173
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	4.5598518475646586
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised.	2.5750388793822814
As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts.	2.5867180238910517
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions.	2.6776309973277104
This is something you already know, but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening.	3.604064537399969
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system.	2.7123547278359745
It will become totally invisible!	1.845978260381352
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.	2.489127852010165
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them.	2.5314181883006475
This is the topic.	14.939740560403644
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	3.6988680539814474
That is all I have to say for the moment.	3.8950950880312405
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position.	3.2019116380324553
Mr President, allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation.	3.6419948323393143
There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters.	3.5953656108741066
Having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the Commission' s proposals and Parliament and, having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions, I should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made, with apologies if I cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name.	2.742769624710345
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off.	3.872914633795954
It is important to remember that.	5.311220483572703
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference?	2.280087147178734
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation, the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster.	2.843245195920392
Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!	1.782268614297348
Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats?	3.2219011466181207
With what aim?	1.3294806940938673
When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	1.7967748308292673
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.	3.3267902998664374
Such a view is not only a political cop-out, it is positively dangerous.	3.8813051172137336
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights.	2.477247393542365
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	2.7343961643470043
That is, without doubt, too short, too sweet and too little.	2.928251303815178
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision.	3.8887696569294303
I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes.	2.687631141371228
Does the Council consider that, on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty, national legislation on transparency can be regulated, that is to say legislation not relating to the EU' s institutions?	3.141047173145228
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals, action plans and strategies.	1.7288512135172787
Cyprus and Malta	1136.5989259806026
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that.	2.640871797551779
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.	2.9430831606811934
We already have a directive.	3.6825892493084336
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	3.172078988313057
I beg you to intervene.	1.693658270940682
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	2.0547962622680256
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes.	2.763289307045153
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication.	2.082520457240657
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis.	4.57219485421979
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted, but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make.	2.6094579897280976
Lastly, there is the desire expressed both in the Commission document and Mr Decourrière' s report of using INTERREG for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not think that the Structural Funds should be used to repair the damage which the Americans inflicted on Serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual.	2.984534371408644
And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark.	6.235877580551695
It is, after all, only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law. Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence.	2.3892799945159995
Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out.	1.6279591710343018
However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision.	2.6356468777777278
Key stakeholders, including consumers, are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests.	1.7925230616224377
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless.	2.015899734766764
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	3.8302676130180524
On this specific point, we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction.	2.473600679454587
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective.	2.722456771657808
We adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue URBAN - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because, as we see it, programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the European Union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the European Union enjoy peaceful coexistence.	3.789979009939281
I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all?	3.0851373866518554
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue.	1.8185158560966896
Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	2.6393746004202705
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union.	1.8764680144217747
I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	3.0687362400330613
We need to clarify the liability for transactions.	4.548815258900504
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	2.258823058352833
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off.	1.5489690950388022
Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think, in general, that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations, as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects.	2.7413614011848857
Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects.	3.0940430605136378
By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States.	1.9571282738660711
To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply.	2.662497827684547
However, such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis.	2.2492908190141243
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him?	4.022110599494459
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner.	4.872524766467848
Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission.	3.421199714336063
That position is like holey cheese, or to keep it the sphere of water, as leaky as a sieve.	4.156937257444937
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	3.258253547482336
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not.	2.8530534057112953
Having given them thorough consideration, I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted.	3.0544079687860455
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006.	3.1823749625420192
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	2.2914842139380958
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	3.6389866888347124
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain.	3.0339793667875177
I would like to remind the House of something which we often forget, and that is that the investiture of the Prodi Commission, last September, received wide support. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of Europe.	3.3547432549672167
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	1.934029578304659
I have received four motions for a resolution, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.4301414731403974
For example, as they stand, the Commission' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto.	3.0873054329273732
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa.	2.2272443553344874
Mr President, Mrs Karamanou' s question is an extremely serious one, and I would not wish to conceal that fact.	5.039596087015398
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	1.6124362125189362
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights.	3.0507230050660588
The labour market is also changing.	3.1222133078491385
Nevertheless, I would like to add that with regard to cultural policy, and in particular the audiovisual dimension, the Portuguese Presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching European audiovisual policy by adopting a Media-Plus programme which could go some way towards allaying Europe' s main fears.	2.4950772858207078
My reply to this is that, firstly, countries should honour their pledges, namely make 0.7% of their Gross National Product available for development aid and cooperation, so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose, namely contributions to development cooperation, and not via an artificial and probably harmful route, namely the Tobin tax.	2.4727010173163153
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today.	2.684905665876772
There is neither coherence nor human decency here.	1.5063798411490772
My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy.	2.8718406779645274
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age.	2.254704447629671
Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence.	3.433456762773653
This is very time-consuming, and, more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances.	3.6772436272675058
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	2.628858137612042
Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements.	2.868573672658686
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	2.443850826744793
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	2.97319630847802
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism.	2.3201637343062544
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy.	2.2464972327683594
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate.	3.1339621302236527
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East.	2.678355620799614
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	2.3274693856505957
I am very grateful to the President of the Council for the statement this morning on the Middle East at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of Minister Gama' s insights, as he arrived hot-foot from the region.	2.9487102785390653
This, indeed, is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	3.1655018093121807
This Parliament has been given more authority, so let us use it!	3.302934635453177
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular.	2.726764362838619
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made.	3.8348359422898985
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low.	1.5229811120692498
In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources.	3.1978227638553762
Quite simply there is no question of this.	3.1811299716851176
Mr President, there are economic frontiers within the European Union, and the internal market with the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is fully operating at this time.	3.384375137913313
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia.	3.517916641865711
Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday.	2.6658531181662943
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible.	2.244366075144271
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	2.511325384932116
I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going.	3.662958670320099
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	2.2447673088697355
I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law.	3.60619091050949
We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy.	3.026252959043507
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit, thus preparing for the future.	2.050234548989131
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	4.432157725528117
A programme such as INTERREG is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders, projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at European level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale.	2.5499503157044936
With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners?	3.075066852830582
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it.	3.7982459971777907
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	4.2489123325815
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	2.9168291350300217
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises.	2.4300494769716288
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly.	1.7106703045186897
Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part.	2.959517747288778
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee.	1.941286060009663
As regards the issue of cacao, chocolate: I repeat that the 5% has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries.	3.246644668958397
If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility?	2.3303615683902152
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council.	2.712141541431512
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk.	2.8529371704555735
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements.	2.7625578241285473
It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission.	3.5677433389486484
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	3.4359325664873563
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	3.589783416874658
. Mr President, I am full of praise at the sterling efforts of MEPs --some of my Labour colleagues among them - on the ACP-EU Joint Assembly and their efforts towards securing a new Lomé Agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.	2.6634330457559776
The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	1.9358166041469722
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission' s proposal.	3.1396171298494635
We must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry lobbyists; on the contrary, we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and, hence, cost-covering prices.	2.6959395100318666
LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States.	2.5187967699348177
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact?	1.733985786581558
EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention.	2.963659551288874
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier.	4.077419343489781
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up.	2.300339239663583
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve.	2.130377318553492
I shall, however, mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers.	2.369505170543818
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	2.010775655360771
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid.	2.2721790694933137
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	2.374427653184585
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions, we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed.	2.7887961030984108
If we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises, to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship, I am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this.	3.2674712645464905
In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian Government has been brought into the peace process, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.	3.0365325297799135
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this.	3.425556854493328
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new.	3.2661465814107955
First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite.	3.4280131819720077
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	4.010345256113573
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1, but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks.	3.00188587216476
It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light.	2.4999610190230213
Now who should pay the costs?	3.5156028534785952
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	2.274751429677036
Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn.	3.33944129720432
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries, but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge.	3.662799145464388
You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	2.9211314899594276
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	2.357685186982319
Yet, every year we have the same problem.	3.4367686357201594
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn.	2.2797807319066195
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	2.417383901122659
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities.	2.181103987603191
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.	3.3800078295286933
That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	1.9893339601811126
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	2.5250658958892367
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	2.7417797789418237
As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor?	3.4539112187297993
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	3.3891911426762023
In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level.	2.1738587683102426
As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament.	4.080069808389722
My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.6876482278795777
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics.	3.1206638913461835
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	2.888170365809776
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	2.026113803403033
This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark.	2.844148537289959
Why has the Council not informed us of this?	2.2610441164102726
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat, although, even in this regard, I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole.	2.522999114653106
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee.	2.826738753860611
As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy.	3.7264807881203588
This will facilitate two activities Parliament is especially interested in.	1.6733513219403697
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources.	3.230945746198998
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome.	3.915331665348129
Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period.	2.1233537141276635
However, I do want to listen to all the points of view.	4.844492384532579
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned.	1.9825821458742243
However, in Spain and the other southern countries, which have an unusual climate, the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures.	3.0274915496859247
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	2.757806418175207
Not that we do so every week.	3.4307132117614523
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference.	4.07569460135415
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems.	1.9146462488188587
Questions to Mr Barnier	5.564000301584752
But, at the same time, we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government.	2.45831652431907
I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support.	2.7826312541706684
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified.	2.193268915097285
I must also tell you that in the year 2000, when there is so much talk about us, the coalition talks with the SPÖ failed - and unfortunately so - because the Socialist Party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme.	2.6148401187758603
I am opposed to making the car owners liable.	1.9591672564947176
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.	2.1818191269341085
I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she.	2.768158736220752
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale.	2.371155596732001
In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village.	2.7984948872595776
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card.	2.0729082460324864
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation.	2.40178674674845
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction.	4.684344734041087
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	3.5542158624780242
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission.	2.410844249030348
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	2.0357909177694355
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	2.70704971272155
We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results.	3.0744130382847503
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad.	1.8281368081972864
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake.	5.874607671836586
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless.	3.8155698137020213
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	3.695513117989082
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues.	2.312817398467729
Only one manager has participated in gender training, and for half a day.	2.2107282329183144
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	2.8482052470880097
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	4.055010121449033
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them.	3.9477154427956482
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states.	2.963896317450263
Secondly, for economic and monetary union.	2.3169995872604208
Subject: Community EQUAL initiative On 13 October 1999, the Commission adopted the Community's EQUAL initiative, the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers.	2.8359876826636032
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme?	2.54794267870939
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace.	1.976679328233232
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	3.1299039340729156
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans.	3.592731974327029
On behalf of the Commission I am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do, in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change, to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the European Union.	2.880212266754534
It was never the responsibility of the farmer, it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again.	3.0797062342223347
Therefore, the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure, including possible action by the committee responsible.	2.9770186782513957
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases?	3.3364013346199295
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.	4.316616694633787
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	2.9807069387241847
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	3.306630299985255
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found, and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the Greens were almost the authors of.	2.731173762576944
I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands.	2.8572459755390045
Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used.	2.6045662587523837
I think this is a very sad state of affairs.	3.7097381202364152
However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them.	2.1009129655071725
Mr Solana, the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis, have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union, throughout the world, should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden, which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power.	2.716026567192355
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate.	3.2321557725450747
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed.	3.0276446388875518
I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion.	3.1698368526936984
I should add that today, at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe.	2.6870761884296237
Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe.	2.8634174128073355
That is not what we want to do in Europe.	5.981750034611495
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax.	4.349908729706544
Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war.	2.6088835858165362
Madam President, the European Union was built upon the idea 'never again' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia, concentration camps, anti-Semitism, heightened nationalism or war.	3.089737182692817
As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety.	3.623109605239921
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	1.790684092692866
With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it.	3.8358427205149006
On this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay, conditions, staff representation rights and so on, but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters.	1.9045123154566947
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General.	4.214993077895922
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy.	2.1426752795585675
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport.	2.6315119925985324
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	2.2285718748423053
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	2.3342403234895563
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods.	3.7954722219481964
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come.	2.8741481398170765
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war.	2.2221055171035773
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation.	2.691435941276496
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always, as he indicated, worthwhile.	2.3168154202210154
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	3.6373235209813055
European competition policy, as we very often forget, is not just important for fair competition as such, but also for prices, growth and employment, and hence for the public.	3.708846487339461
Consequently, we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens, as borne out in the committee meeting.	4.803118424339189
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and, although I come from that part of the world myself, I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe!	5.050587763992526
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	2.406113994157606
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states, and Member States of the Union at that.	2.4077374063484447
Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction.	3.1278208871669064
Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.	3.8439257295554095
And of course, tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment, especially among society' s more sensitive sections: women and young people.	2.196442704024596
As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law.	2.756274850582684
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	3.786692624629293
Ideally, I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges.	3.742083967558363
This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.	1.5515159158540677
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods. Just as the Sea Empress, just as the Braer did.	2.3901579186600124
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices.	2.537357477181476
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	3.111508778691122
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers, millions of service users, in a great rush.	3.0146237748440092
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people.	1.8625916552985096
In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected.	3.1420717222262105
Finally, a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report.	2.306981782701621
Many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan's report.	2.678166278768884
From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.	3.1645214305156517
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	2.5039992332258443
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here?	2.357931725517397
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation.	2.149769805643411
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations.	3.707950620109529
Now is the time to devote our time and energy to aiding Cypriots from both sides of the "green line" in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long.	2.613901151584825
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view.	2.5005754765577795
The conservative government leaders Messrs Major and Kohl decided in a cosy fireside chat at the Edinburgh Summit that it was totally unnecessary for the Spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the Germans or English.	2.7565284649209945
It is quite the opposite.	4.974739943645462
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help.	4.484604827708695
I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	3.035718128596283
This brings me to my second point, namely the snail as symbol of our postal services.	2.3952102843416285
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence.	2.0401904316970643
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.	3.3755013256632656
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way.	3.9742220728579913
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way.	3.458337219533728
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.	2.663984765040419
.	77.3301660757284
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	3.2302414440284504
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency.	2.0649667287753286
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	3.5664290341788
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north?	2.3163163469657624
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Agenda	21.75018985665072
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment, which are in keeping with the Commission' s guidelines, cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards.	3.4203959186644863
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' .	2.8741886720829704
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food.	3.3901192688337054
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere.	3.9195214310156783
In short, we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol, while at the same time promoting growth in our economies.	2.0466888607727287
Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict.	3.1049245559248577
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14, which is contrary to the Commission' s right of initiative.	3.930143667758521
This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States.	3.317992111659862
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	1.8488494378435927
But if we are to secure the public' s participation in this new planning, we would like to learn what plan the European bodies and specifically the Commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	3.0729511243918566
However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe.	3.2382544123791996
Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference?	3.6812105513851865
Schroedter Report (A5-0108/1999)	1.288342709821954
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	3.247861689176962
In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending.	2.362996222820166
This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.	2.6741262769857976
This is supposed to be our priority, would you believe.	2.797576707152226
This is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before. We also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less-favoured regions.	2.881884574259215
As far as Cyprus is concerned, although the Council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. It also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition, which I welcome.	2.487612635889991
Hence the need for the most coherent European human rights policy possible, which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable, and I have in mind, in particular, the references that many Members have made to China.	3.2509449269455533
According to the International Transport Federation, over 40% of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience, the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety.	2.7820174301919613
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	2.615672407224786
For this, of course, central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy, so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any URBAN programmes implemented in our countries, and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings.	3.7632439715809594
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	2.7941771930062593
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.	3.0239341695295323
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended.	1.964565241900445
Action must get under way immediately.	1.7703474198223015
There is still more we have to do, and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that.	5.378020517429025
These are what are missing.	1.9942379398388275
I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union.	3.649801356645742
During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation.	2.6960782436073902
Mr van Hulten, my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon' s plenary meeting to embellish this report.	2.7757556484782087
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	3.745121804324181
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text.	2.5242946674898072
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO' s action, and this overall value judgement is positive. We agree with the general view of NATO' s action.	2.795879727194193
(FR) The Lomé Convention, on which the entire structure of relations between the European Union and the 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries rests, is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north-south relations.	2.7145650378222244
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	3.1611748560271473
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	3.0758230435179326
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated.	3.0516538892990592
However, the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the Treaty and, in the final analysis, represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens.	3.2808574172744467
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law.	2.4143460613441885
And what about agriculture and the environment? Still more problems, still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted, not to mention research, emigration or health.	2.3829414569934673
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.	3.5624915272495556
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	2.3493912359503155
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car.	2.625502021387637
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	2.726263135057567
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction.	3.0536932585062244
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea.	2.1560745819943294
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	2.8408762907342644
They are the result of human thoughtlessness.	4.523761800344812
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	3.439173050165858
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference.	2.9674037836655236
For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe.	3.506237117133986
Talks in Austria on forming a government	1.1410169165689805
We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability.	3.39576695221261
In contrast with that, I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies, which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion.	2.6656365170597804
In particular, it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone, where people are less familiar with the new currency.	2.8602453888476136
Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too.	3.825922625427972
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth oil slick, the seventh since 1967, shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.	1.7228063763793948
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow.	2.693804331034214
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	1.539759620648982
I want to underline that point.	5.364623833188684
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.	2.5082699623039773
Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August.	2.066541805303913
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.	1.6414789186459402
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement.	2.4982227072751955
And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to "refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention" .	2.5008028945652185
Mr President, I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it.	4.546520177603274
Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area.	4.46106665154923
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives. I hope they will be supported by this House.	3.0539015032559087
If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification?	3.5588554202490696
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	2.6218933615203794
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	2.788917923882151
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century.	3.545149396209753
Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter.	2.544016184651954
Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area.	3.3524196652756446
Furthermore - since we are in this European Parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the Commission within the European Union, how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level?	3.493211531164698
Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau.	2.6532912209575943
They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves.	2.0820942584422233
I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion.	2.5145863701432605
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	1.6943367209436453
Consequently, we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be.	2.2195443029651307
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	1.8085543879603858
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat?	3.177760764241473
We are, at the same time, negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide.	2.2300938814258475
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers.	2.1390553804009533
It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes.	2.356526440455122
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved.	2.4621014783715194
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.	1.975785580894445
This is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund so that the European Union, in other words the Commission and also the Council, can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.	3.80794603088726
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	2.7457401316521293
Incidentally, it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.	3.300531137555487
Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry.	1.861941329082629
As I have already said on a number of occasions, I am in favour - the Commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect, on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process, the common constitutional traditions of the Member States and the general principles of Community law, rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator.	3.409727221402808
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair, when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings, but these were neither heeded nor passed on.	2.2872534385481784
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
-	32.62528478497609
This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is.	3.0732402090209727
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	4.211581161092733
Secondly, that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society.	2.3760209479878256
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament.	3.192000741066349
And so it is the "two key" principle that applies here.	3.292718914291562
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list.	2.5622757762385167
The inconsistency is astonishing.	1.2497941820889074
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session.	2.9288748409338523
It is very important that these negotiations is not secretive with the European Parliament or the national parliaments which, when all said and done, will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process.	2.9726240258586563
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia	2.139627294991409
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP, this dimension must not only be preserved; above all, it must be encouraged.	2.724361468990934
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones.	3.7207027421339567
Mr President, our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the EQUAL initiative so that, if you are a British Muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group: you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems, rather than being defined as the problem.	2.6064601419418287
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People' s Party has been advocating for some time.	2.526703536358665
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	2.8174771115734454
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	2.7669362604064665
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard.	1.6661127899430597
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	2.6921714520753075
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well.	2.8376651988223376
They belong in the legislative text. I might do the same if I were a Commissioner, because I could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and I would not always need to work with Parliament, which takes so long and is so difficult.	2.5933294578376698
I believe that this is particularly important as EU Structural Funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds.	3.1749590696811407
It now appears that this desire is more serious.	1.7954776274816142
The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party.	2.1502495319270523
Besides, we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries.	2.0824217784230536
Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy.	2.0340820331411362
These challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them.	2.263349172765111
It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed.	3.017386973823076
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.	3.1565810818093127
The motion also asks that a position document, drawn up by the Commission and Council, should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF.	2.861796320902493
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	2.202213301427983
And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect.	2.49886386118436
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria.	3.257588970392928
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution.	3.013593832980894
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors.	2.481238606816331
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis.	1.7623391826257775
What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?	2.0168466213209686
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition.	2.3421578206776763
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission.	3.5147366975086367
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable.	2.9870747164997793
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers.	1.7578608367704494
The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated.	3.7019653946450584
Indeed, you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate.	2.115112631621788
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	2.6023638545204735
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities.	2.262262256512917
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority.	4.32959676846668
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.	2.2764410059878792
This is not rhetoric, but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission.	3.657160563558403
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	3.70127625997235
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products.	2.2630912364092346
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day.	1.6218016699815287
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer?	3.0454790372236125
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe.	2.6528951136225993
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	1.607728841677959
This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium.	4.726985236742326
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	4.566457539972633
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	2.4784496363042994
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.	2.652558346910149
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest: will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture?	2.9565080763743863
It would be Europe' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe.	3.195457947986809
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations.	2.7250174168480275
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events.	1.711136415023386
Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin.	2.2128038489150494
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved.	3.3416133591195933
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	1.9585683106775797
The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number.	3.0702737981050214
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	1.8871349225502736
The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water, coastal waters, inland waters and groundwater.	2.5285211399031047
Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union.	2.8363285368580375
the oral question (B5-0004/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Council, on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax	4.24610040290582
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future.	2.7317691883867092
In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions.	2.9381007184667705
Article 177 specifies these objectives as "sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them" , the "smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries" .	3.5814155734206983
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this, just as you yourselves do.	2.4797565555668295
That concludes Questions to the Council.	2.4430055644493702
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry.	1.7962594084371284
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?	3.7721647337518776
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	5.40491105998456
Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason.	2.9101072393441774
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe, healthy food which is produced, as a matter of principle, without any questionable or risky interim or end products.	2.485717322418032
Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	3.11288869865972
And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.	2.979198381069156
This will also be important with a view to the special summit in March, where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment.	2.6672718419543027
Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these.	2.0982945469181624
I would nonetheless like, as others have done, to touch upon the procedure, which is unclear and, above all, unwanted.	2.8445550203184475
In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe.	3.3819469918887215
Mr President, I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms.	3.776341123843796
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights...	2.802519364679706
In addition, measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender.	3.4143191811662224
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.	3.1366015972948555
This is also true of development cooperation.	4.900482712841329
The Commission, as I have promised, will complete its proposals on the IGC opinion about the legal system and the Court of Justice within the next few weeks.	3.6828074332033967
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors.	1.752979711239111
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	4.92709350447386

The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake.	2.7170300812043076
As you know, the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular.	2.197999337601294
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty, both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health.	2.6694569604983767
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	2.658107732094563
Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these.	2.2846964810809913
As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments.	2.5004060071210223
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	4.1411270714411845
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets.	2.2451600585030516
We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright.	3.161203958334329
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts.	2.4746317410246528
In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	2.7012621041295324
It is time we stopped this trend.	2.4858957049228896
We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only.	2.9555755646664914
Mr President, Commissioner, I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group' s spokesman, Karl von Wogau, for the document that we are debating today, and which has had a report written on it, points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success.	3.618955683687262
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	2.8332615483035846
In France it has had enormous resonance, particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty.	2.878511531375044
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of?	3.240532457471358
(IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined.	2.730227134995255
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future.	4.7964726095099826
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	3.379667209243388
I know I can rely on everyone here.	1.7208459827772307
However, the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned.	3.2091705586727555
For me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in China - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this?	3.5414848222859603
I have also noted, to my great satisfaction, that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty, or the eurosceptic groups are calling for Europe to regulate, and I think that this is in fact the right level to take action.	3.2103895532223037
But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau.	3.210500942553127
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration.	2.1838549428718004
Therefore, Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I would ask that this issue, which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the European Union, be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years.	3.458154870501979
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis.	2.238376535639277
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem.	2.525850256358437
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs.	2.2228513926243174
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.	3.1001692014926183
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma: whom should they support, the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food?	2.2132148958208977
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year.	1.974820469444442
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China.	3.133209843414487
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.5188712904074
You said in your summary, Commissioner Prodi, that liberalisation, competitiveness, keeping inflation low, innovation, science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs.	2.3171399203061296
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance.	3.0695186538043244
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	3.0358593893258856
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but, nonetheless, the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward.	3.3452941530645135
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal.	3.7631370417223393
Parliament has no equivalent power.	1.8522350560805296
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings?	2.6930550169679686
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities.	1.8883677852092784
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta?	2.4580242245328097
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities.	4.487193129671021
Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People' s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People' s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.	2.4496527154355405
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark, that is not where the problem lies.	3.2315907367344323
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function.	2.9431627641536036
That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.	2.0454130025411725
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.	3.1100116573982937
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone, is not workable.	2.806275802450163
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union' s policies to date.	3.540206637177292
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out.	3.5249469457048233
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	3.2762807362197766
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	3.24922597475464
The Council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights - and we rejoice in this; it has decided to implement Article 13 of the Treaty, combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia, and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence, as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the Union.	2.803426803791557
Madam President, Commissioner, the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature.	3.237103012977829
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	3.1673307008761786
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country.	3.2901186315107886
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.	3.47183908052229
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground!	2.1356254418524165
Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect.	4.18239604736391
. Yes, Mr President, that is true.	7.866921229436391
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	3.0540051612134533
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	2.898367137996607
If we develop motive power of the kind I have described, I am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload.	2.496616875784371
I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the European model which is based on family farming, mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs.	2.7613576127638364
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	1.5730923700850281
The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow.	2.5809712135951792
I personally feel that issues such as peace-building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of African Heads of State, with capacity support from the European Union and the OAU acting as arbiter.	2.633493252128935
But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward.	2.8765730069969546
The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole.	2.7472032010178666
Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Liikanen' s words, and I am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because, although the subject is broad in scope, it also concerns a specific fact.	3.7791698461826244
On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime.	2.907525650113253
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.	3.113630884910036
Court of First Instance	1.0020964854452834
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history.	3.623804648390231
Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities.	2.323610650169877
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions.	3.0218068215204474
All this is happening on a daily basis.	3.3003906085370707
It is clear that, over the past couple of years, we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure.	2.7522726131278885
This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.	3.138993500957813
There is not one truth in Kosovo, there are several.	4.859693672715123
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect.	3.188865390778525
In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states.	3.528085042779755
One of the main differences in the comparison made recently between Europe and the United States was not so much job mobility or risk capital, as women' s involvement in economic life, an issue that has much more prominence in the United States than in Europe. This is a field where Europe has, nevertheless, always been in the vanguard.	2.7606508947318162
Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective.	2.979249498049804
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means.	1.8404096403404693
But at this stage I should like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and taken from practice.	3.2327165602316703
My second point concerns the safety of these plants.	3.2020688757142133
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all.	1.8198794171123442
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned.	1.9829403909774155
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process.	2.972463116763173
In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	3.2193892783353872
The European institutions should follow the example of a number of countries, most notably the United Kingdom, and institute a committee for standards in public life, with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the European institutions.	2.8451565849458844
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	3.488983614434257
Such a European strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, notably through new technologies; training in order to upgrade skills, quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism.	2.927833497304339
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real.	3.0632350717497268
In particular, the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems, improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment, in the graded management of coastal areas, improved training, information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management.	2.254051684944424
In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway.	5.3852123371697065
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	3.2709434906682695
In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines.	2.9481446953088257
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief.	2.4283330568859207
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently.	1.912543715274219
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments.	3.930385004632872
The applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens, who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way Europe works, as it is not resolving the most serious problems.	2.830697266564986
So, once again, why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest, valued in France, by Senator Larcher, as it happens, at FF 8 billion?	3.3426731042798505
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report.	5.528967216071805
I am therefore voting against the proposal.	4.187823047650652
It is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some Member States, especially Britain and France, seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty.	2.140328492593452
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge!	3.356919502641619
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia.	2.5908795254257777
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that.	4.4996498911631555
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic.	3.228378034290469
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March.	2.7926881504607515
Only the Amsterdam Treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the British election if you were going to have any outcome from that IGC so that was a different reason.	2.5413742451162302
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has.	4.958891067527561
More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border.	2.4436041062716507
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme.	2.480989068146662
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community. At the same time, we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists.	3.388030855517963
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	2.580732754224982
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised.	2.783205686108056
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	2.886015364618475
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	2.3867453708047366
Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry?	2.2633652938814084
It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples. This must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion.	3.579204528361776
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage.	3.057195131565602
First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly.	3.933509090881447
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions.	2.914130251899067
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years.	2.0029885312414133
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	2.975830207164848
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	2.5589882196899847
Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British.	2.993198774876109
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines.	4.264345270010663
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned.	2.629350951728217
Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests.	1.6022034928850981
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER+ programmes.	2.397139013393784
Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread.	1.6354445589469617
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic.	4.450001704511785
In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	3.1192699783831666
I cannot answer that question.	1.6434148170019613
Can anyone argue with any persuasiveness that women are treated equally and fairly, that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, belief, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, opinion, political affiliation etc?	1.7824433538620157
We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee.	2.652698984901608
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment.	2.092876517295858
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo?	3.313169110816368
I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service.	2.8999653614886625
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	2.759489265405291
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand.	2.1288099634203688
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	4.5339789252738285
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point, highlighted by Mrs Frassoni, given that we now have an automatic information system.	3.232668765144109
But I do not believe today, nor have I ever believed, that our burgeoning economic relationship with China - manifested, for example, by China' s EUR 25 billion surplus with the European Union - should silence us when it comes to China' s human rights record.	2.4439804777813046
You might have added, Mr Solana, 'to give me their instructions' , because that is what we see, in fact.	3.1018039117571905
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter, for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate.	3.234598246817634
When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence.	2.746641251016966
This suggests that something must be done, failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen.	2.000954482514681
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities, better known as ISD, is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion.	2.741953324989146
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.	2.331088403459085
I agree with this request.	7.747619226573508
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU's financial support for less well-off regions.	3.8909312864324352
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area.	3.2796782004916194
I think that given the dramatic circumstances, and as a matter of principle, it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes.	3.4702854548720405
In some cases these operations were prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions.	1.7514397061006204
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.	2.76153985681025
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo.	2.9403661506187833
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	2.9864703774078234
Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe.	1.779243767507372
After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making.	4.64638601494751
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	3.3781265790536206
Scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and, in those circumstances, as scientists will have to travel, it is probably better that they move to a central location, once again where the parliamentary structures and the Commission and Council are based.	3.0209321170872623
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance.	3.878895805067716
We want to bring this across in Parliament.	3.9801621505326485
A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry.	2.768891525133581
First, the form: the draft convention is vague in the extreme, and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society.	2.7182895016963764
In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water.	2.2131628710251467
If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision?	3.0661636079151977
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	2.9573140466359638
On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women.	2.59297841562259
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms.	2.3284161825741263
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	2.4261703880705694
It is precisely this which, in a sense, is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme.	2.8751801556581458
Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure?	2.7628192527059836
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	3.1026967406473913
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter.	5.034528161287241
These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe.	3.1562994962608943
No, we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit.	3.455087544439673
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer.	2.9256246464116034
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point.	1.8223244761516015
And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later.	2.521120731180412
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	2.640795634531319
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee, we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation.	3.385115852926782
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group, for the first time, in parallel with the January part-session, and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions.	3.387546644854128
By means of this extraordinary procedure, Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs, namely with the previous Commission.	2.1461533458345015
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process.	4.143981169014256
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	2.3946358175744686
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism.	3.1424731909760752
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	3.4396322378544486
That should be the starting point for our efforts.	3.462943632849104
Mr President, I also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Corrie, for an excellent report which I think very well describes and summarises the work which has been done in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in the course of 1999.	4.196207724689229
That needs to be addressed.	4.804123630599239
We can deal with it.	1.9836458576805536
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years.	1.7949720901032444
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey.	2.8141769361889977
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.	3.858803032688882
Subject: Opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the EU Under Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, it should be possible for all EU citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the Union.	2.7049221347147188
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.	3.567906032316456
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament.	3.597059109067333
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	3.2838113274277774
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	3.720903603389322
A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	2.205401008019132
I just want to outline some of the issues that we, as Socialists, have put down as amendments.	3.1454682279749777
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia?	2.081400903695235
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly.	2.228027943117069
How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan?	2.4490731218877153
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.	2.5335591815660874
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	2.416675217205911
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition.	3.0972926193958044
On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form.	3.5039966183765854
The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: "Security within Europe is not divisible.	2.946801951004887
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo.	2.4963007530769614
First and foremost, we need to compete in terms of quality.	5.149785308626249
The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	3.429189712207692
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.	2.5116776103903677
Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do.	3.2119935601738523
However, there is a current trend - the "fauna, flora, habitat" directive was quoted as an example - which, in my country at least, creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to Brussels and that Brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the European Union.	2.7470988103797302
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	2.8721827196786154
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	4.447964712658661
Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today.	3.2482803016075055
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules.	2.2811297682310894
By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years.	3.049987134357897
If not, why not?	2.6092977399783934
We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.	2.0534008950254825
It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool.	3.431101466407757
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse.	2.106617412810006
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	5.4577060283733365
Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics.	3.045821248907225
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail.	3.292349097216055
Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known.	2.571757481450458
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity, but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world. This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent.	2.861095997038324
In the last programming period 9% of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives.	2.6438455322366443
Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported.	2.3134035419353536
This would then give us, for Wednesday' s sitting, the two Council statements on the coherence of Union policies with development policy and on the UN 'Human Rights' sitting, followed by the joint debate on Cyprus and then the reports by Mr Swoboda, Mr Corrie, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Knörr Borràs.	2.5025818076946944
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market.	2.1421001091688194
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values.	3.28584069389053
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account.	2.759943999430949
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	2.592398008608381
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence. It is something that is earned over a period of time.	2.4563467176932976
In Spain, a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe.	3.0435771324833567
However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis.	3.0443043249914834
This recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made, but it comes at a price: it follows the restructuring of public accounts in European countries, which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a Europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries, banks and public services, even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go.	2.5210254075707055
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises.	2.089570697077227
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality: water will be the main resource at stake in years to come, starting tomorrow.	2.5798034365656193
This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould.	3.1565728762859058
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks.	3.0164655363228774
At the moment, our group still feels sympathy for, and patience with, the Commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past, but this patience has a limit.	3.37491254588906
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	3.8798903444017765
Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union.	4.298420411118629
That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	2.744147030190822
Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy.	5.039867761141527
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers. Far from it.	1.9715675107420576
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way.	3.2118771363205667
First and foremost, I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years.	3.2052282109981594
That is why I will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today, and what the Commissioner has announced here, actually leads to legislation being produced; in other words, if you all go and say to your Heads of Government and Ministers: "you must push this through in the Council of Ministers" .	2.9844840344009143
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas, hops, cows and Indian hemp.	3.0552972884188208
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament, which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights, should fail to adopt a clear stance on this.	2.5083518179986
(FR) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions.	3.1532729161327424
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars.	2.123147881494052
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading.	2.7047122781685893
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report.	3.628505077362665
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted.	2.979980882053138
This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles.	2.53041751985829
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.	1.6553951359896173
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	2.028208591160178
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.	3.001867494104387
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).	2.0766316850698794
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	3.3422706853356137
What answer will the Commission give, when it is on the scene, when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building, and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc.? All this is well-intentioned advice.	2.7396675555283876
Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	2.9110541665447864
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court.	2.721213214017154
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	2.9522449139405844
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication.	4.032476956240624
How are priorities supposed to be set here?	3.1090348940709935
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities, the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration.	2.4563991951374264
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	3.216099938117331
The tourism market is by definition a flexible market; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light, with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work: remember that 50% of employment, especially in southern countries of the European Union, is done on the black economy.	2.6322047918153775
On the other hand, we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe, which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon, and a European Union at the service of the citizens.	3.47959861327286
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	3.780697165377582
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations.	2.282022325922606
.	77.3301660757284
Let us beware, too, of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application.	2.234034373629222
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	2.1463173482334232
Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues.	2.605409797557769
Mr President, Commissioner, if we are honest, we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation.	3.4647306440114334
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	4.38342702547215
Secondly, the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative.	3.800164558326456
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	2.8714307256287332
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	2.6566640252134706
Europe should regularise the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections. Only then can we talk in this House about an area of freedom and justice.	2.7141088411367
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which, as our resolution points out, causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster?	1.9880424459719734
We know full well that what you are doing, Commissioner, and that is, limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the Structural Funds of the new Objective 2 or from the provisional Objectives 2 or 5b.	2.946467633521728
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector.	3.3241210166135233
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements.	1.9769571471832645
I have a number of ideas which should be put across.	5.616384498992666
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	3.1432272385453954
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role.	2.7843314859750854
Mr President, for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union.	2.716969401824938
This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty.	3.0873684923841576
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	2.83285593075449
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	2.6912565986216888
Finally, I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty.	3.352754683214755
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases.	2.5467549963012264
However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy.	2.3998002482782104
I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November.	2.9030070408160715
There is no other such policy.	5.004611459235209
But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether.	2.352013221129376
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	3.2647239847723
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of, in my view, useful figures.	2.6901957951367197
That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner!	3.005799338631511
For this reason, the draft reform, which has been drawn up by the rapporteur, Vice-President Marinho, is to be welcomed.	4.346595944657766
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste.	2.0944185268697963
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	2.0102368668243145
This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union.	3.4161805213156575
No new knowledge was needed, because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold.	1.883956565654442
I would also like to thank Mrs Terrón i Cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, and to thank all the Members who, in their various committees, have actively participated in preparing this annual debate. I would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society.	2.868459737495704
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.	3.432297645259992
Fourth observation: the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.	2.2348768014048765
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	2.7933571708569827
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	2.8957413755422
I think we need to seize the opportunity.	4.69017332408168
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	2.313678018115033
Madam President, I believe I am expressing the feeling of a great number of Members of Parliament in most of the political groups when I say that the message which the President of the Commission sent to the new Austrian Chancellor a week ago created some unease.	3.8693304589398907
It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens.	1.8855624198286496
We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future.	3.067540738335492
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year, may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years.	2.79333519219421
These proposals must include a number of elements, an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies, a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan.	2.2299121027713094
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this.	3.2296228037659382
Firstly, I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and, secondly, on the need for transparency with regard to this aid.	4.673560937834464
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you.	4.091005229165634
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons?	3.0188794606011577
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that.	4.016643370966088
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax.	2.8319189948467463
I think that, under the present rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation.	4.4211316622033685
Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy.	2.1383358325759416
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace.	3.2853651333704406
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions' way of working.	2.3791227992484263
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria.	2.7272307619266014
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan, in the case of steel, as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid.	2.8374986418075565
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level.	2.748419333758011
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months.	3.144029044016335
Thank you, Minister.	9.769457061169787
A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste.	3.3764660733881593
The people are holding demonstrations, they are sending us e-mails.	2.553237588681822
We can but thank the parliamentary committees, which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far-reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which, in its initial format, we did not find at all convincing.	2.6045314258650625
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	4.085070115448082
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor.	3.0013244830086
It is simply too bad, and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor' s Office instead.	3.1092279440536186
Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report.	3.146571396066467
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone.	1.9237305294183134
We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments.	2.5878982189860813
The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions.	2.157230541786756
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved.	1.6239220390001081
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	2.1243518766106244
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees.	2.2262221701840788
If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security.	2.8650677570552117
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner, but it still takes far too long.	2.0706815699539187
In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic.	2.5888844769821144
There is nothing new in your work programme.	3.0236116731961515
A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999.	3.078208258734756
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages.	1.9129147779765874
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day?	2.2926378527959708
The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice.	2.630648610747775
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners.	2.4966349806832997
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	2.718118059394458
Is that really authorised?	1.5417112541868558
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process, it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity.	3.202662888521031
If I have not already done so, I would also thank Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	2.7759064571110694
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century.	2.951793777794231
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	3.0820028848661436
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context.	2.322991414290491
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again, later on this year, discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea.	2.1826487164613213
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure.	2.248977394894819
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe.	1.8401017967484556
I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure.	4.009341111241615
The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term "foolhardy," and this is not allowed.	3.2369755121621306
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources.	2.6647583513073805
In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia.	2.1024521250481683
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and, as such, a threat to Macedonia' s stability.	2.4154815192794556
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	2.050520409627979
This is what the Commission will be judged on.	6.608516071274859
These are thus extremely important questions, which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion.	2.9699811434471806
It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives.	3.8735961719894374
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks.	3.2810372793370455
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity.	4.2090213736516
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation	4.055805437325275
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense.	3.944410027892401
Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.	4.676138261971129
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	2.1907283211636215
So, the Commission, in bringing forward their new proposals, must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services.	2.5601150291396704
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired.	2.497423085116687
We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.	4.275189739643779
Naturally, that they should be environmentally friendly, that they should be recyclable, that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment.	3.230397766109355
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	3.413314084619286
The Commission is following with very great concern, as I know all honourable Members will be, the emergency situation in Mozambique.	3.3564264230837315
This is what we have, and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken.	3.0459921154749123
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter.	5.502029115707023
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	3.412753158729407
Both LEADER 1 and LEADER 2, which were implemented in the 1990s, were ingredients of the new CAP that emerged after its review in 1992 and, along with other respective measures, they constituted the so-termed second pillar of the EU' s rural development policy.	2.504605971962856
We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other.	3.232401249387565
It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	2.3526100662865623
The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships.	2.2128881748371274
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	2.009499579312799
Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union.	2.2506614914333816
Like many other hundreds of volunteers, she had seen the destruction, washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there.	2.0307979067687287
I would like these words to be heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable.	4.026926731120308
They were the first to say that, each day, they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there. We must be very careful about how we use resources.	2.622135605126235
In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others.	4.2903474057368784
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	2.181550386102471
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out.	3.359838992022346
In addition, I should like to make a number of comments:	5.272409488825657
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts.	3.0690757394713013
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan.	4.238440495062378
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out.	3.5144268262148257
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States.	2.0446728787633397
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened.	1.9141176245842164
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers.	2.479927395778724
A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden.	2.5231469267643374
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes, in the Agriculture Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council.	3.705185532172067
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.	3.804521532218312
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti!	1.5306395311883543
The first is that economic policy, employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional.	3.5732426520266296
Women and children were beaten.	2.3418459562813165
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	2.7146034924079983
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	2.9957145848881495
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	3.2655764458767202
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006, but that is another subject.	3.572616082370096
Nonetheless, if the opportunity for Member States to determine the areas, within the scope of this initiative, remains available, then the Commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas.	3.6064195039693283
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	2.838857971529494
This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence.	1.9720350330627403
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years.	2.326904150962873
If the representatives of the Council of Ministers take an equally constructive approach, then I have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in Europe under the conciliation procedure.	2.8775699590904775
However, these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted, in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives, particularly INTERREG.	2.1539343363710945
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now.	2.8596051505856948
We are a group of unity in diversity.	2.0271460543255304
Against this background of extremely high expectations, I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step, namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia, is vitally important.	3.3255077002248217
In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one.	2.881760119093195
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration.	2.5404076938651245
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning.	2.3350411505269237
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.	3.1731542947269413
For example, to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union. This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions, for example.	2.8127676461102245
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise.	2.8439820705082424
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans.	2.7496303758601464
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	4.566947352361866
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	3.4256509590352104
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time.	2.668993249902017
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends.	2.249283544426758
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica.	2.315818321460179
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.	3.20352346380475
Madam President, although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague, Mr Florenz, that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included.	3.260932779317059
This latter point is of particular importance.	2.177228510476096
There is clearly a more ambitious goal.	2.4322139477416065
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	2.9447001416528584
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists.	3.185438836065278
The debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of Stock Exchange securities, the two main market stability indicators, have, for some time, been at danger levels, as the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe clearly illustrates.	2.4739509997486735
The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community.	2.3676844876468155
And when that assessment is complete, we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us.	2.6202343943189392
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system.	2.3086371418395903
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.	2.492679773346308
As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos.	2.1850818366177
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	1.8656906065831929
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	1.6994466362913614
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally.	3.3877319119533094
The Commission' s intentions in this area are positive, as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive.	4.97529084727224
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content.	2.4418971935626423
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever.	1.834018875486271
Social problems will increase, interregional disparities will grow, and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest, areas where there are more people and, especially, more businesses.	2.408022164823855
Thirdly, we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention, how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively.	2.208262082592276
Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes.	2.0855508744642175
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward.	3.021751830518594
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	2.478690256219582
Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries.	2.384037259246839
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks?	2.8109559899320655
In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented.	2.086799130691446
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	2.3248604559390253
Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts.	3.8338412242002002
This message must be very clear; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow.	2.992675227357172
And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee.	4.332630432913078
I would like to make two observations during this intervention, which stem from the report itself, given this Parliament' s obligation, in accordance with the Treaty, to produce a very succinct report, which does not go into depth.	3.539223032367562
All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process.	2.526044399029881
We need to open that debate.	5.359751661017888
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo.	2.1220760079307817
This is the problem, and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council, which is one we find completely unsatisfactory.	4.902246050746901
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	3.0987254092607546
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	3.294886760793382
There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness.	3.0708627336000824
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.	2.5494330427751066
How would you describe this?	1.973925785984437
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy.	4.050806350371693
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve?	2.3433302031475947
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer.	3.550342366492185
High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force.	3.1098870267795555
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	1.2605856117352525
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character, accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others.	1.9659975711724649
In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage.	2.352939760994281
Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000)	1.0525208825556664
In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life.	3.285231400818743
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies.	2.7184270844335807
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.	4.116527213165903
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals.	2.3531366231066855
Madam President, the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair.	2.661471260556278
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	2.8585874668494853
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.	3.1682761920352656
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Andrey Babitsky.	2.1101215948389576
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	3.6340212884921907
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority.	2.624890942148994
The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations.	1.8301875382036674
Everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that, with the necessary trust, perseverance and indispensable political will, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prosperous Middle East, will be achieved.	2.8025441688589012
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs.	3.28099739093267
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the most basic aims of the European Union' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area, and this, of course, presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved.	3.7385734833919546
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	2.68291252462417
The challenges are different.	2.1929514718979335
Briefly, these are the main points of the reform.	4.682575614984647
Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error.	3.835135186437321
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	1.448708658751458
Is this too much of a burden?	2.3955118963022595
This objective deserves our total support.	1.6617196273816377
I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin.	3.4778189085794877
Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational.	2.4402318277861292
Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself.	4.078994640046518
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	3.0319151307303573
It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence.	2.536365937087173
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses.	3.596552867162138
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations.	2.4854151784313414
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO.	1.9465384320980441
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible.	2.1169118131271563
I expect that Parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive.	3.15962027323018
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us.	2.675678409343039
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.	2.4796884699912765
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010.	2.4415904655328933
For this reason, we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently.	4.106431638285442
In its unaltered form, the present directive could, in fact, have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water.	3.206529929461966
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States.	3.492161219359086
In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress.	4.589557255351724
Employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism.	2.1166911423443895
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution, their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious.	1.8964352165222342
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries.	3.514372770980994
Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute.	3.9891395983129385
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity.	2.609574753022031
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance.	2.5898514671381174
Mr President, I would like, in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau.	3.3217841828874923
Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve.	2.094707094656582
It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied.	3.3766768282505537
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore.	2.582945053718442
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	3.6625019442336795
A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises.	1.7983809400691115
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000.	2.221386604196548
It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses.	4.07803914200894
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	2.4437862363024014
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	2.1509182326621024
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control.	3.521849442626128
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	2.962798223976361
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	1.7391232751345402
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security.	3.5827478993401667
The knowledge that the framework relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee.	3.1456350470932373
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons.	1.9147675057086613
We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society.	2.8802754056323026
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth' s sake.	3.498629245165261
(The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m.)	1.7855796626858025
Mr President, first I want to compliment the rapporteur, Charlotte Cederschiöld, on drawing up this report, which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro.	3.129381755813501
Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh.	3.2576988728454013
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China.	2.7519425306129217
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	3.032035359530245
The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003.	2.6837793942418875
Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives.	1.6265915663944377
Not only the difference in income per capita but, above all, large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern.	2.407779411829019
Mr President, Commissioner, I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims.	3.228267056046792
In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs.	2.5067545526686232
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	3.6726680153070896
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	2.7299119361126905
We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle.	2.6892622484321245
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending, of course, the reception and examination of their final proposals.	2.8692538853683476
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector.	3.2208885292216682
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	2.7212392910499013
If this cannot be adopted as the objective, then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020.	3.072902496540795
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution.	2.4634599270701423
Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it.	2.8765493128386517
Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process.	2.5224550184803753
We must not, with this in mind, pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting, improving and restoring their quality, as this would create a superfluous hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques.	2.5931295629000335
The measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective, and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection, environmental policy, transport policy, taxation policy, etc., which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult, since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them.	2.303705553783278
Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union.	3.271899390050198
Mr President, Mr Patten, of course, you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in China, and you are well aware of how hard the Tibetans are trying to initiate a debate, something which has always been blocked hitherto.	3.606437065664969
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible.	2.7027044523540154
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	1.7561484514874435
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay, and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners' Party.	3.0019012485241485
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	1.9935032587193782
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions.	2.6420466754314593
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow.	1.8652351190489327
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health.	2.222090167640806
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your response to the Member' s first question and the supplementary question.	2.8480463479793277
Madam President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party, there have been many occasions on which I have stated, at the committee stage, that the European Union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly, and in the measures and rules on pensions, as is already the case, in coordination.	3.661198830307079
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	2.0254320618673036
This brings me to the content of the report.	2.913472360897568
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs.	1.9005925138230255
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice.	2.6574967220204866
This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty.	3.4830677016761133
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice.	2.766600273447486
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	2.395829578909996
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than: "It has not been done before".	2.321524885139427
This is a crucial goal.	11.168591376125196
Question No 6 by (H-0122/00):	1.1672026996941478
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	3.2604442347271143
Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission.	5.4828216287253415
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened, uncharacteristically, in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well.	3.110161087525027
Since, on account of the college system, discharge can only be granted to the Commission as a whole or, alternatively, denied or postponed, it is no longer of any consequence that four former Commissioners who belonged to the previous Commission that has yet to be discharged, crop up again as Members of this body.	2.6105894863748715
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension, both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good.	1.80030492846219
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	4.163421324064457
In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to.	3.127964571162864
We - the Commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink, and we shall therefore do two things: we are, and will continue to be, fully committed to internal reform, and we shall rethink our policies in detail.	4.135498830933502
So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review.	3.4125133959321854
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste.	2.3882157862479225
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.	2.132928020936021
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	2.3190992308283445
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	3.505794179881881
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist.	3.7291092142805984
We will talk about this on another day.	2.138037125263776
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support.	3.231060962098757
In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors.	3.0459770864246414
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session.	2.2750588200782986
Since time immemorial it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as Andalusians from day one, whether or not they were born in our region. Therefore, as an MEP, but primarily as an Andalusian, I can feel only sadness, repugnance and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community.	2.2983261399690202
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	2.9038599915779573
To conclude, the issues are clear at this second reading.	2.678304307501932
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful.	4.4741772095938535
However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State.	2.8073140542803747
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	3.3399120510730844
In many cities in France and England there are now slums, breeding grounds for many sorts of problems.	2.0569790136905377
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	3.821491120627695
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do.	2.9626750279188845
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	1.9784706902337263
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally.	2.2618944288568885
Answers are still awaited.	1.5773550433050352
Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia.	2.181066868837862
Is one free when security is no longer assured?	2.290623546056855
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia.	3.7523747001560013
All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required.	2.367477691108353
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary.	5.241323345590746
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses.	2.370507249791704
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars, and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open.	2.3015020568284803
In terms of human rights, Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights.	4.7997499095697505
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	3.499117584646834
Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future?	2.635087581296956
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	2.632402213163055
There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used.	2.2237540486178324
What happens in another part of the world affects us.	3.7193513180907836
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way.	3.604664062623741
We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises.	2.3675047547789143
This social freedom, which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor, gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability.	2.0779045509896497
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy.	2.4023100698211968
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors.	3.1554500605003106
Nevertheless, despite these aspects, European citizens are disappointed and concerned: by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough; by a Europe trailing behind in technology, and seemingly falling even further behind, and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too; by the European institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times, starting with the Commission itself.	2.4627666239992414
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part.	3.2737863193438397
Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report.	3.185637869805635
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions.	2.847164273962912
Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment.	3.6888498683907405
This, however, does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously.	5.276399038953688
Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised?	1.5749107549504857
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	2.6731190579705566
This is particularly true of what Mrs McCarthy said about URBAN. I should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and I do not see why I in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her, for all you owe her as far as this is initiative, as well as, more generally, all we owe Parliament.	2.8303449918006685
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	3.8606601357662726
The CEO of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known, who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food, particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition, diet and such issues, so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority.	3.0315739158799273
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.	3.532727398525661
On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, and in particular with Greece, has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too.	2.8401514260043528
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	2.7604499555418456
We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier.	2.749211075617444
Austria, therefore, is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled, and even duty bound, to offer Austria his best wishes.	2.7847679524069573
In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme.	3.3448303123540275
Mr President, Commissioner, as a Member for the French Atlantic coast, for Vendée, I should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the Erika oil slick in the face of these disasters, caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us, but by a crime.	3.03371202405633
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate.	2.4155473428135643
Report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD))	2.087680437690697
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service.	3.0899271773887924
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	4.428544781837184
Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation.	2.3883111242128487
Of course they do, but they are not unlimited.	3.3943804721245465
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory.	1.4673762040925586
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms.	4.034106734032542
So, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo, and above all, keep our promises to them?	3.283335207344214
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	1.6311100272635775
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything.	2.2431887142993974
I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances.	2.451235759550619
Madam President, I absolutely agree with the rapporteur' s analysis and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Culture, Mr Gargani, for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also, considerably difficult.	3.0835615651667228
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too.	3.052702639031443
This is not the way to fight extremism.	5.5403390242988415
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree.	2.458363790865815
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars?	2.4964682539387115
Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services.	5.967984042328397
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce.	2.3779287427764904
It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else.	2.7072497341648596
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case.	3.6711988672012787
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market.	2.9603278134282998
Mr President-in-Office, do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an abomination for the continent of Europe, a shameful thing, which should motivate us all, so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous?	3.0252966264777905
Subject: Promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions Given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions, and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on, in terms of either finance, entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities, living as they do in rural districts where 80% of the population is on the poverty line, what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment?	2.1016451856383496
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail.	4.0007104198069285
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States.	2.4135783366997456
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating.	2.5193558118272863
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape.	2.035443293103849
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today.	6.0429906488344844
When will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group, rather it is a joint European challenge.	2.6237350210620107
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country.	2.1369011227277666
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made: fear of modernisation, globalisation, and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security.	2.397111832058863
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now.	4.553906605432061
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations.	2.6083633946066636
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes.	1.8999549239442892
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria, and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens.	3.146030406697253
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing, at a later date.	3.9650617682348046
Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility.	3.0304955940029905
I do not usually bother congratulating people but I think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks.	2.89501424485167
And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary.	4.3030183356023
On the other hand, we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down.	2.6394171997239795
In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system.	4.093513462709708
I just want to emphasise this further.	3.6692079938626154
It will be easier to take account of the developing countries' very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies.	2.4124781723539783
It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on.	3.1495873242165016
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers!	4.421204339142318
Finally, let me repeat, we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations.	3.234874781913558
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation, in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles.	3.1015443412773203
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	2.3475678765693755
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives, but in connection with general political concerns.	2.242020496240335
It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban.	2.9172800105212504
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success, now and in the future.	3.348752210066322
It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding.	3.773600668401913
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States.	4.130925874664615
We must take the best from each of our countries.	3.7850934398305838
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there.	2.290015822347096
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	2.575263655847675
In the past the British Conservatives' double standards have brought the United Kingdom' s House of Commons into disrepute, and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this Parliament.	2.8315609531845953
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us, especially as the very source of life for human beings.	2.6081812160672415
What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?	3.6239320050515627
Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice.	2.8321916903247955
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union' s development policy.	2.8884823663677803
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	4.038681917308487
It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example.	3.607083930464032
Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left.	3.535358396264061
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	7.348137303142132
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya.	2.391280010634591
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this.	4.678037197373184
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union.	2.6932201009197207
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses.	3.1073867352925335
The EU is also a union for employment and social justice.	4.823382532900067
As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now.	2.8678934228923505
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	2.7767573423453227
That concludes the vote	3.842803773284961
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer.	4.057236821622767
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	2.203388032055603
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects.	2.4402218708007686
Water, in this context, is a commercial commodity.	4.9807895568412395
In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict.	2.6361004523469793
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation.	2.3513775847366403
With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money.	2.942383641183385
Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this.	2.954486256766588
For example, the LIFE-Nature project in France, at Grand-Lieu Lake, planned without any coordination, led to a real ecological disaster, the de-silting operation which was carried out without regard for French law on the subject caused significant silting of the Acheneau, a water course located downstream, destroying spawning beds, filling wetlands, and who knows what else.	2.8520301860871218
This is the Commission' s own survey.	9.159146409502851
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	2.4060416749714055
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are, they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves.	2.3282495693617884
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are.	2.654245943226157
We must therefore ensure that the EU provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another. This has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way.	2.550974074571094
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect.	2.152939636933757
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	3.1001502118038955
As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, "In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"	2.094928011450063
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: "In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British?	2.0898747984130615
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.	3.295151271985979
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	2.3518058236207118
Hence the transmission.	1.2922886496429513
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety.	3.0574840491494104
The decision to establish a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic, including all people, whatever their nationality, or excluding some.	2.3966276780805886
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	4.175543914086483
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament, through nominees or even MEPs themselves, were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated.	2.508020400236873
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union.	2.574558229272305
And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	3.5240737558266244
(Parliament rejected the proposal) President.	2.2796280748343065
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings.	2.0485289934944406
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	2.7052673952181268
But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect.	2.4379084951545447
Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence.	2.2480836000231776
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament.	3.5104106044387424
These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95.	3.799673444156032
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations.	3.197950974281562
And indeed there is a twofold shift.	4.043211429151695
Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses.	3.1104619722442175
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form.	2.0392911593548986
We know that there are other topics: for example, many Members have subscribed, along with us, to the issue of the seat of the institutions, an issue that we believe should be considered at least at IGC level.	3.7775394812402507
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	3.7282723539482068
A communication later this year will give full details.	1.7838874727068155
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one.	3.0113859608058737
Your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this House' s discussions, because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length.	2.753681710046818
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.7717412517672257
the oral question (B5-0005/2000) by Mr Désir and others, to the Commission, on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax.	3.8709963290203873
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April.	2.6873322911460464
.	77.3301660757284
Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states.	3.3425005796489975
In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on.	4.182156403402252
Our responsibility as members of the European Parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that, when the time comes, the citizens of the European Union and the citizens of the Czech Republic will approve the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union through their elected representatives.	3.567011351060159
Could you please give an answer on this issue?	2.944398624289334
Just consider the facts: we looked at Austria a while ago, but we can also look at the stock markets, Mr President: given that the euro, that great undertaking, has fallen 16% against the dollar in a year, then perhaps, I will not say a government, but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of Commissioners or similar issues.	2.6243282777899313
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund, which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal, especially for countries like Greece.	3.2854528857865635
This extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and, where necessary, confronting these is seriously limiting the will, duly confirmed by Mr Prodi, to grant public demands.	2.2852188261464192
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us.	3.331927504761911
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market, we must also deal with the darker side, namely bankruptcies.	3.600798150932731
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off.	2.4879030351179985
Finally, Mr President, the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission.	4.317092139987174
But now I call on you, in all consciousness, to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital.	2.398523625634944
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example.	2.405758641800777
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union.	2.9626804456635747
However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be.	4.411284196226584
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months.	2.8354522843623733
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement.	3.0407708654548924
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	2.040355035164713
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted, which is a pity.	4.383075390310587
Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications.	1.6636734148952395
Mr President, I would like to take a brief, critical look at the accession negotiations with Malta and would like to express my gratitude to, and admiration for, the many NGOs that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals.	3.258549528739018
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	3.276616474407641
However, saying is one thing and doing is another!	2.0969933256420252
I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other.	2.540653009963411
Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later?	2.4190106532468416
I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect.	3.819763630212357
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework.	7.357159331607159
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	3.373657695854037
My second question is about whether the Portuguese Presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue' s being solved in different ways for Members of different nationalities, or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities.	2.43542027733098
The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer.	2.1285794710397568
Emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the Jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis.	2.7207998468598675
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	2.3393004192687568
I wish you every success, President of the Council, in making sure that the European Council agrees to this agenda and that on Valentine' s Day when you start off the IGC it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion, also when the French Presidency takes over, by the end of this year.	2.8910656582358185
. (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council.	3.06941390608749
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you.	1.6241034147896676
What should we do with the shredded products?	2.7931513796147054
We have never before seen such serious, clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.	2.058578966450023
Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a "service provision card plus notification for each individual contract" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract.	2.901391477069025
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	1.9795288065771912
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	3.8423031277373747
Furthermore, I cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the Lomé Convention, and the fact that, following extremely complex and difficult negotiations, we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first EU-Africa Summit.	2.9744029474719667
Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta.	3.079059177086137
You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that.	3.546678976127176
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	2.7933804655551624
In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing.	2.818310958584561
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear, which, in turn, will result in a stock market and economic crisis.	2.3443910416061033
I have almost finished and I would like to say that I have personally requested a public hearing of the Committee on Transport, which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the Erika case and to suggest possible future considerations.	2.7156910022940783
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence.	3.253682704005806
More women in decision-making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well.	1.6657926753648313
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	3.1556877433615504
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	2.8091840799758767
It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council.	2.6359198112087685
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes?	3.6502683016140987
That is where the potential is.	2.385894835585933
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice.	2.221907769783331
-	32.62528478497609
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn.	3.1959787188950437
I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks.	3.2527661623189044
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies, but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes.	2.91447884676663
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire.	4.255455799872983
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view.	3.333199859607795
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot.	3.2974625825779498
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU.	3.649650125592693
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation.	2.449555773949866
In this regard, too, I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate.	4.36032568599663
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying.	2.144590964819817
I therefore welcome the Commission' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie.	3.793022644194552
Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with.	2.8576545912722944
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high.	3.025653212305414
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support.	3.1854569771057206
We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure.	3.5035042715493305
Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	3.048817394416579
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors, esteemed European Commission?	2.653923745293489
Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities.	1.9718800792622058
Is this right and proper?	2.640558373135456
In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns.	3.220210455839178
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians.	2.3930426939221836
Before the end of March, I propose to present a communication in which I will possibly present legislative texts, that is to say, amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the Council and in Parliament.	2.9676022055351035
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly.	2.480394447476846
Finally, this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity.	2.7310751270949027
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	2.5778572158325783
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add).	2.9172613131318292
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women?	3.135629095251228
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	3.3048337600975373
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward.	2.454921023968518
That would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges, with each Member States drawing up its own scheme, so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected.	2.3078980491064085
This situation, as in neighbouring former Zaire, is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom. As Mr Soares just said, a truly terrible situation is developing in Angola and in other countries in the region.	2.9573042384274575
Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the "polluter pays" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate "natural disasters" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds.	2.341012928240772
Mr President, I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so.	2.5296364334616364
The matter is still open.	2.110326192935248
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is, after all the difficult phases it has been through, at least satisfactory.	3.014775392007119
All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work.	3.837239935475957
You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana.	2.2777100357346947
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States.	2.4796609380922967
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.	3.357749234497835
I ask this because of the issue of coherence, the subject of this morning' s discussion.	4.131576544549882
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	3.580380405882148
Fleeing from all quarters, hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town.	3.160695194274503
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.	2.0870831049233365
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges.	2.443078324048537
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union, provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners.	3.036703573394073
This constitutes a good example, therefore.	2.6375986250867367
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted.	2.9308828652223364
During the Portuguese Presidency, we will be continuing discussions on the CAP, by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the Union' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers' incomes, paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family-run farms.	2.873370656234886
If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before.	2.8289642037989347
I hope that the next time you ask me the question, I will be in a position to give you more detailed information.	3.932630862899051
A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system.	3.2141481957438516
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.	4.022424787286721
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic, racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it.	2.1341745557859784
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers!	2.4966723853853763
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	2.4281254964889887
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area.	3.7194965504142887
By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society.	3.240067656624837
All the foreign troops, including therefore the Syrian forces, must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council.	2.369613384162161
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom, which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced.	2.0678836421644387
Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	3.4682053881106687
Mrs Karamanou, I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough.	4.913760077015677
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined.	2.661415720464212
That concludes the debate.	1.5326323786505276
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive.	4.252183691079671
In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.	2.380780660959613
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre.	2.7352574245368
It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies.	3.6879165405645775
The Commission will fulfil the remit given to it at Tampere to present proposals for approving definitions, criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings, economic exploitation of immigrants, and sexual exploitation of woman and children, with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication, notably the Internet, for distributing child pornography.	2.2218662903670894
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	3.5034213169023203
I hope that the Portuguese Presidency - and I add my compliments to those already offered - can convey Parliament' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on Saint Valentine' s day. In any case, tomorrow we shall vote against the IGC agenda.	2.6592102227718732
We must not forget that people working in tourism, especially women, encounter particular problems such as seasonal work, the need to renew contracts from one year to the next, social protection, lack of interest in continuing education, and reduced possibilities for development.	2.4472870243991935
(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen (all the more welcome for being so few in number), one might have thought that it was an unimportant subject which was to be discussed at this hour, but that is not the case.	2.7331593056876797
Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action.	2.7228180555624424
To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors: seek better focus, better coordination and concentrated activities.	2.658186509238983
May I ask: Quousque tandem - Noiz arte?	1.9793191170414728
We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia.	2.865177106548881
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000.	2.9959587984280267
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.	3.4691970167127097
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies.	2.0918227218565906
The intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support.	2.1614374743365956
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty.	4.274535158989696
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.	3.5317487709718867
If that does not meet with a positive response, the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed, not just by the Commission, but by this Parliament and by the Council too.	3.2725717068309046
This is in place too.	5.360809073404604
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty.	2.589210155813888
If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	2.874785850460857
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	2.9779147334844245
Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults.	1.8186532537612907
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers.	2.1187817173629764
If you travel to the Netherlands, you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free.	2.3972987453362484
Question No 8 by (H-0042/00):	1.1672026996941478
The vote will take place tomorrow morning.	2.5265829901616375
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful, because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million.	2.2679997953659616
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?	1.851509607075128
An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary.	1.63674460501932
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	2.631108898349394
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex.	2.230698470954943
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption.	2.759508308441517
In the course of the 1980s, most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation. As a result, the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years.	2.401054025654242
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw?	1.8517468166408333
We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job.	2.8246526767706377
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.	4.623461918902546
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	2.5514169020861748
European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner.	2.3699593272503408
This is repulsive most of all in social terms.	2.9546162198085195
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	2.552112236837107
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers.	2.810491404367141
My group is fully intent on helping with this work.	2.0392824668736336
The next item is the order of business.	2.695619994284941
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	3.466413128866837
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President.	2.8668954575126033
In addition to a report of this kind, I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character.	3.4154455084720277
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports.	3.242066941646104
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	2.2435428134633253
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK.	2.3288420757393555
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	2.86534849831019
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated.	2.371570409525663
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	2.493106230016505
The postal service is also the social service.	3.3456629109251375
If the world' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax, the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas.	2.680588070801931
Madam President, it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before.	3.776923816857168
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on.	3.333248739264809
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika.	3.2998808777727424
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest.	3.0292107867797617
Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.	2.241105697011933
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	2.9459177358081887
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved.	2.5489464556983403
. (FR) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment, poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending.	2.26213491748232
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	3.26437475816081
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to.	1.7845358221374945
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular.	4.216410481221966
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives.	2.740801765016988
The cultural programmes launched in years past - Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael - are being replaced by a single programme, Culture 2000, where - and I must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the European Parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor.	2.185431911088561
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	3.8059372202382464
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.692565634831119
I hope there has been an interpretation error, and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech.	3.2066783553346956
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	1.7879791748818306
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing.	2.15836006543089
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC.	3.1705500168532668
With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar.	3.340238323619918
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3573064339158158
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.	2.8131399558151835
Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions.	2.9801203589680525
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	2.851849776516322
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	2.407642217263353
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of.	3.549990009672438
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	4.8439071835562215
For my group, enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured, be they governance, be they the intergovernmental conference, be they reform of the institutions.	3.1433175829309166
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future.	2.901955377689955
Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed.	2.6580758890328484
A few salient points: the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect, especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours, including those of a financial nature.	2.1513596352565205
I have three short questions, the first being as follows.	2.387815944556369
There is nothing to indicate that the Member States' legal principles, legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting. Nor, in the light of the international convention of 20 April 1929, can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases.	2.29115617705111
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office.	3.094626679222244
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones.	2.7872866134276766
In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the "communitisation" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters.	2.464481217132345
It is minimalist on a number of points, especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of, and conditions for, implementing the derogations.	2.695941801332697
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal, namely China.	2.6646660080235636
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro.	3.4968079305265545
Overall we have a system which has made some progress.	4.2112992255117065
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports.	2.859474698121139
It is very difficult for a Commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time.	3.053451796596973
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products.	2.145037286680144
We are talking about macrofinancial aid.	2.8451143777469023
However, the thing that worries us most, Mr President, is the decrease in prices, by 30%, owing to imports.	3.115749781948549
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress.	2.857978768063186
I will end now.	2.609428922934845
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future.	3.4366481880643187
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon.	1.6432349131809936
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	3.099108161502454
I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance.	2.3110407466613734
(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes)	2.2101603850117555
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes.	1.5395045924594026
Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about.	5.388530342053135
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report.	2.3550012936866382
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	2.117761075416886
Serious response to reports, confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure.	1.633176136357853
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.	2.9850683862246385
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland, as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries.	2.708511952351935
Michelin caused a great stir.	2.189206689786583
I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity.	3.7140527774663417
We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted.	5.392212788640276
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism.	3.4359065658024486
Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union.	3.5818876443797256
A socially just Europe is still highly topical, for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union' s policies.	2.7595992313794775
Even the British Minister, Peter Hain, conceded this recently. We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government, he told President Dos Santos last month.	1.9621089913198502
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	3.821596035920117
Reality is obstinate.	1.224018089996612
I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation.	2.590742695568599
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market.	1.9923676123297642
We know what actually happened.	2.2455182313024324
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	3.162695662210228
On the contrary, it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further. This is shown by the following figures: the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30:1 in 1960, 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997.	2.475716349048487
First, perhaps, I should say something on the question of the legal base.	4.2646026657339675
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party.	2.1257975657461
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation, which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States.	2.3941870433576895
The proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty of Maastricht, raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 European system of accounts, which, as you know, replaced the previous System of Accounts adopted in 1979, and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories, consistency in the calculation of the ratios of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of ESA 95 and, finally, recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology.	2.5911132455654373
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	2.5457539356815038
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	2.033665975090541
Commissioner, Mr Solana, there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas.	3.552158916906587
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights?	2.94344950446327
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	2.083060302779425
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now.	3.122470330063494
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	3.0530469921665095
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles.	1.48402568619164
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe.	3.3419569160626574
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	4.378899691307656
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded, but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information, or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission.	2.464180059038734
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	2.247390064602931
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state.	2.891393163220668
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests.	1.8125133101219637
And there are more and more of us in the world.	5.23777200434717
The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	2.5606076082670644
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	1.4090652235943488
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy' s effectiveness which must therefore, in my opinion, be significantly improved.	3.1792754913621577
In other words, social security is a factor of production.	3.932551055555123
It is indeed.	8.817185903009971
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	3.1398523294343454
Yesterday, as some of you have noted, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe.	3.1132945518653243
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft, especially helicopters, of which it is clear that too few are in action.	3.4360311261791776
Even if we hear nothing else, we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see.	3.4283742867055897
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections.	2.8966851001417515
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	2.4021149572550997
I believe that, over time, the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue.	5.508888977638558
Amendment No 10 which I tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of 'economic and social cohesion' rather than 'regional development' as the European Union does not have any recognised competence in this area.	3.6038052482595346
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick; that of the power to act, democratic legitimacy and transparency.	2.674489299160995
For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur.	2.3677676870977957
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned, so far so good.	3.810405105582028
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role.	2.9153175498225665
It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement.	3.248084001459795
I shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment.	3.6892871539527903
The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control.	2.234441285902988
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank.	3.459742077064419
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm.	2.392829811037045
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	3.8443474321306534
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say, although of course he has no obligation to do so.	3.2495611765755092
Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration.	2.7823614728094817
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.	3.6044387791113044
We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.	3.015210220481701
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	1.885052577663453
Coordination is the key word here.	2.4688910389936862
As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources.	2.650705467356159
That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken.	2.968517160168257
This is a sign of hope, the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia.	3.913522434114793
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States.	2.699601858473957
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas.	2.719424928622469
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker.	3.0144233616450578
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration.	5.6509945000115875
Are we naively to grant 'freelance' enterprises the right to operate selectively and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot, of course, be checked?	2.2944399219937193
My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs.	3.3422723087276376
In this sense, I share Commissioner Patten' s positive attitude.	2.672419702187956
We will make the Community institutions aware of what we are able to do, and what is possible in general, as regards coordination, not just at political level but also as regards what the Commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process.	3.43457561101937
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive?	5.741099232567838
Once the project comes to an end after five years, the policy of free gifts also ends.	3.076671502906122
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age.	2.579326739425386
Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote.	3.0270208085717134
A month ago, the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment, as prescribed in the Treaty, in order to implement Article 13.	3.939399920716374
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal.	2.717315239457544
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts	1.9316290039895594
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other.	2.518854069390537
As you said, Commissioner, we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out.	3.2766019126553085
Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy.	2.8543720589276615
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	1.9606829103002963
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word "trade" at all.	3.079111035570054
That is just the way things are, however.	2.3350668455466503
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April.	2.586857431659453
For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use.	3.90551221771793
The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up.	2.4530500602587484
We need public and private investment.	2.1455470647218746
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector.	3.4787516706878847
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached, or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved.	2.532446369642558
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	2.133481752686084
That is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is, to a large degree, about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future.	3.7403890563515585
.	77.3301660757284
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34% of the developing countries' gross national product, compared with 5.3% in the EU.	2.9394490526575865
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.	2.048551002237932
In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission' s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property.	2.7879843149491927
Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey.	3.256531894397985
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so.	4.100180578128664
Common fisheries policy	1401.2667782526073
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source.	1.7577959089454542
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation.	3.248214886320064
I am referring to the situation in Austria, where the Commission has remained true to its role, being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the Union, but also the unwavering guardian of the Treaties, ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities.	3.238408165883805
I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course.	2.5403465215644334
and	39.1503417419713
As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.	3.023829623346936
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries.	3.066776885892969
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.	2.572911296239885
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	2.5797835044746233
Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay.	2.1097995150053115
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)?	2.218153377447265
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	2.0834119821085615
The Commission, in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference, has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission.	2.7565036777080243
With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE.	2.7565863504338055
Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system.	2.655816161197439
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.	2.0995507875260824
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	2.44314934095841
Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions.	3.6529476546410993
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.	2.6044463928373918
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	3.4481826606788286
I say: shame on them!	1.6445894372174177
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago.	2.3968037840009866
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	3.6341974683033347
LEADER II (1994-1999), for which a total evaluation has, unfortunately, not yet been completed, had a wider scope than LEADER I: there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated, after reallocation of resources, probably amounted to over EUR 4 000 million.	2.1103040989274287
Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe.	4.104968802975102
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is.	3.037440012962319
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level.	2.478620315498049
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity.	3.0090952746219655
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	3.010928134341188
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document.	2.78899620747768
We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones.	2.478995084463619
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken.	2.971864775786894
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	2.738891285696115
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete.	2.171926280237574
For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases.	3.3585265586668784
Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime.	2.6643766204176047
Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level.	4.63193915096735
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	2.5177223446767156
In the stance that we took at Seattle, why such a silence on the EU' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the GATT, including for the crucial textile sector?	1.961723340589125
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue.	3.2177142140987876
Mr President, Commissioner, Director-General, I would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von Wogau report: I welcome the Commission' s open-minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules, and to propose practical reform measures.	3.5031573098459976
Modernising social protection	13.031247207967853
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed.	2.2278778057142214
When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying.	2.989795989596506
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical.	4.784675952388088
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America.	2.8962218199080865
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month.	1.564916179154485
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen.	2.84241695880725
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	5.523551883673076
We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	2.644319488936379
This is not an option for us any more.	3.4332283019188017
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor.	2.779278543288198
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling.	3.3374980585338943
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment.	2.073830281374639
The new INTERREG programme, in the form in which we have received it, takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions.	3.0040929824138436
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I have read and re-read the Commission' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office.	3.7070522067091933
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4.	4.312445137742037
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.	2.092633250447557
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	2.182196275384631
This is why I personally have an idea to supplement Article 7 of the EU Treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis. Finally, this is why we have public debate.	2.910077722980278
The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme.	3.2080548411773924
The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security.	3.110765273144897
In 1999, the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions, pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets.	2.529787145332622
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events.	2.2684628968722986
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage.	2.104744939336316
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards.	1.972176256700053
Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union' s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole.	3.7465421532369723
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc.	2.5186945110819825
The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud.	3.8025212448850536
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom.	3.86129597367053
It is not a very time-consuming matter, but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays.	3.9057751200146407
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming, allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme.	2.125778576152842
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other, which constantly takes the form of layoffs, factory closures, not to mention extensive waste of production capacity.	2.236174761830635
a) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday:	2.22924007381609
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs.	4.09220785011152
I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life.	2.228022981835568
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents, is bound to support this approach.	2.1799481889701338
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	4.922623812713541
In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values.	2.913907721188011
TV pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife, in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks, have brought back memories of similar British disasters, such as the Torrey Canyon in 1967, and have prompted many British volunteers to help.	2.1029478369687826
It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together.	3.238553403392383
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.	2.665924607492229
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes.	2.14033909352432
Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one.	3.3798660951881856
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter?	4.058274403731256
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches.	2.579127281260004
Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets.	2.671180726093923
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	2.010775655360771
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	2.852678742557609
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined.	1.8805482399624478
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic.	2.8706668501994983
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.	2.8515841960511263
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe.	3.161534411608898
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	2.6915585985160786
Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor.	2.7023529516503033
From the point of view of economic growth, and therefore of increasing employment and wealth, safeguarding a competition policy in the Member States is becoming a crucial factor, and one that is certainly very important for our future.	3.2195902408019497
At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well.	3.0872016268020346
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	1.9082346005562565
The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought.	3.4533118634387168
Let us grab our chance.	1.9590470949036503
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	3.5200171591516343
Is this simply a political gesture?	1.8184934051892114
Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures.	3.327683993407647
The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns.	2.316073537524225
But I must record that other groups, led by the PSE Group, guided by my countryman, Stephen Hughes, voted this out.	2.6434073262203266
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile.	2.70975612125454
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382.	2.530330218355929
We see it as positive that an attempt is being made to reverse the trend towards water degradation, which is most alarming and which governments all too often tend to sweep under the carpet.	2.3229805914294293
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects.	3.8857629245680725
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	2.0963035031951245
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
As an ecologist, let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches.	2.8240286248250994
During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states.	2.3181910168175826
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements.	2.415083215409417
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	1.9064686674020417
Obviously, I cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here, but I shall go directly back and see what I can obtain in the way of information about this particular case.	2.9398215635578415
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy?	2.6441478166118064
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.	2.14944747119607
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system.	3.7222281775485877
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more, to the benefit of more developed areas.	2.753885073451825
By taking action in the field of culture, we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul, especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up "Culture 2000" are superb.	3.3526007320760494
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	2.0973396053847164
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	3.884116018104353
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
We therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions.	1.5481365059637577
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	3.3308207522029036
It is not the Portuguese Presidency' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants, especially those that the European Parliament is asking for.	3.154564138031048
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met.	2.6287641682748286
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training.	2.739054381845888
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say.	3.591886487161933
A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.	1.9583014746545961
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach.	4.624450673362371
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them.	2.3465765804851904
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament.	2.0782332579977845
At that time, she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof.	2.433654548607821
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	1.675771217499955
However, I should like to ask a slightly different question.	3.629465998007541
In a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment, the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change, anticipation, risk prevention and employability.	2.4492311495078765
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	2.1628222704167124
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics.	1.6962726216737538
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment.	3.165046536386461
However, I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals.	4.010437975556852
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises. What we have here, first and foremost, is an incredibly ominous mixture of power, arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union.	3.1093212471510534
We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament.	3.4087896804214806
We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary.	3.616341694293528
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives, INTERREG III.	3.2574646294286427
This is an effective, transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe.	3.531120500208686
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	1.9941965153627554
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges.	2.7469485218356793
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative.	3.7609098859866825
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.	2.5923769001436203
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice, both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer.	1.9998617313136313
Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us?	3.635066989506413
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us, they want clarity; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote.	2.6181862816528003
Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.	2.053611543057925
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market?	2.3267821264795643
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	3.8296549765542
Quotas alone are not enough.	1.7402117559537873
I am especially grateful for all of this.	2.8163722342822193
However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform.	2.41059330854815
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea, and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean, when we want to clean up purification plants, is a good way to clean up water.	3.2120921353209235
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	1.971131951189358
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner?	3.0728487436723353
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed.	2.290859642357273
Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper.	2.950963836289045
We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union.	3.0507693372120985
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business.	2.379418604105174
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions.	2.4668457710704836
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.	4.201959026154321
We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment.	3.702077493718612
The second area is that of freedom: freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the Union; freedom of information; freedom to vote for all who have European citizenship - and that includes not just Member State citizens but third country nationals.	2.203483821316296
Though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any Austrian government representative to this European Parliament has not carried today, I give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this European Parliament to combat the return of neo-Nazis to government in Europe can and will be taken.	2.978404659740739
It has become eminently political.	2.0859715542222785
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	2.146819541842955
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.	3.1263429329025194
Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well.	3.1620375481943728
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities.	2.17235670751258
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective: to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives.	1.9546559888397697
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so.	3.0398446508360015
An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.	2.0570526766903776
Secondly, the LEADER initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism, with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions.	2.577630021492535
Today, Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups, and these include not only Serbs and Roma, but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power.	2.2580812444155236
The first is asylum.	6.072308324211787
We disagree with many of the report' s views.	3.1323557258484374
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand.	4.709961824599093
And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development.	2.9349220016970787
Mr President, I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report.	3.794656185624048
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"	2.2190076175409184
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests.	2.9979583859799033
It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended.	2.577906738654254
Is this not a contradiction?	2.7489489648148435
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	3.421225108515717
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide.	2.5508642662398042
To date, the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect, and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary, including Article 2(7) of the Charter of the United Nations, which refers to sovereignty.	3.5957943772252836
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity.	2.303127990228652
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	3.182598719080213
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone.	2.3331006130269456
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems.	3.5570228511920585
Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community.	3.810937019219174
Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation.	1.9400555816780045
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	2.4897828425832826
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council.	2.847206391316191
Therefore, more than making amendments, we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done, apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews, especially in relation to the age of the different vessels.	3.4417135119975453
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved.	3.5474412638804877
If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	3.0791350003621543
I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report.	2.9782710249647275
I have taken note of your words; this is something which we all feel very deeply.	2.9122389290685224
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative.	1.7931404689740664
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account.	2.125028497488079
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	2.2738089908545907
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.	2.3150661643873827
Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council?	2.4401288551626803
Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday.	3.6577315908348167
There are still, needless to say, many unresolved problems and unanswered questions, also involving the Palestinians.	2.450759969890246
Report (A5-0003/2000) by Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on	1.9958742098936308
Secondly, we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable.	6.115710501627145
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries.	2.5194131376343045
On the other hand, more pro-active attempts, such as OLAF, which is currently operating, have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights.	3.322868961320144
Needless to say, the directive also needs to be binding.	4.266134038254487
It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States.	2.9725814811416953
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.	2.666627659083076
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion, what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn?	2.484037729160598
How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission?	2.152299156650062
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.	2.8514503387295695
In 1988, the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men.	3.3725503267613277
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft, violence and rape had been brought against him, one of which was for the rape of a minor.	1.897095641302521
In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament.	2.8339062385897567
What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation.	3.339849910070516
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively.	2.066916229140481
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement.	3.3340346216008974
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	3.449172593141217
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner.	2.294785357405369
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	2.699648520599165
Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	2.713226741669343
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic.	3.419111914626482
Another important area is protection of the groundwater.	2.9105917081564843
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	2.8257016413132003
Against that background, our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann, the rapporteur, as adopted in committee.	3.792790186172576
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology, employment - will be a decisive summit.	2.444596005733814
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Mr President, earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment.	3.410474897596595
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP.	2.120500728948743
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors.	2.1273260272955534
That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic.	3.1663957553618745
But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth.	2.7356208778542737
Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.	2.78076796498992
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	2.2105225319229342
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	2.8843772442647992
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	2.2440861875457614
We clearly have different views, one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence.	3.7996942342949587
However, before labelling we need clear rules.	1.7502433329612552
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	3.1397435546712416
In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	3.0556495778230044
Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law.	4.421708363995257
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	2.743119812815701
If we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next WTO round of multilateral negotiations, because it would be contradictory if the European Union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself, only for the United States and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint.	2.9660098488292745
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on.	2.9611504888366027
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods.	1.8480313793868541
As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets.	2.731236891222473
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions.	2.240089399965499
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover.	1.8477355991184958
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	2.5728431477063656
According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned.	2.9940601908646305
By way of paradox, I could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report, for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken, the more the world of crime will gloat and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious.	2.721592697480373
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	1.3777078499470898
We all very much share this opinion.	2.0557888937067363
Today, the Commission is obliged, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people' s demands for, and expectation of, transparency and, if the Commission' s regulation is adopted, the Commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration.	3.210125114885102
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	2.961907856731175
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other.	2.3643750889644597
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	2.1715762763839654
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible.	2.416386952657494
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays?	2.870129005324652
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	2.2671839611667886
If the President-in-Office has noticed, almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo.	1.7464684378788313
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.	3.1965995263360205
However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment.	2.4311566151111754
The other point is that Article 8 of the Council decision does not specify either the method by which the European Parliament is to sound the alarm, or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control.	2.8874148685349454
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	3.558842481240919
The consequences do not inspire hope.	2.359797723428578
Will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because, in the final analysis, we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the European Union?	2.847565986325665
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.	3.1405677362473092
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	2.6201782939362572
Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy.	3.2040608628679257
As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office.	3.0889742182919497
This is something to which we all want to contribute.	5.382499083021628
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security.	2.7371098130874016
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in Parliament, but the URBAN programme is one of the best examples of our work: it was created following an initiative in Parliament.	3.6280673997724575
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles.	3.18480732783232
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	2.6353158943664874
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised.	2.5751415033413774
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life.	2.011281182436938
Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties.	3.3381842166438327
It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made.	2.9080369479630277
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view.	4.470865256324027
In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language.	3.04036982441383
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety.	1.8640646510944583
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion.	2.1385902557282215
Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference.	2.426220867549138
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions.	3.3814997950313543
Two questions if I may.	2.2354303538728706
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	3.219855195319981
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	3.4422922029058394
We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand.	2.9465713000264953
However, because of the Council' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 (pre-accession) in the Financial Perspectives, the European Parliament agreed, by way of exception, and I stress that it was by way of exception, that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 (external action) of the Financial Perspectives for the year 2000.	3.271520478136413
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	2.9226473468031524
In September, we undertook to present a White Paper on reform, and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence.	2.9869378400841597
If we do this, then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount.	2.657239208633305
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration?	2.999822552880534
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level, but at a high level within the Commission - which, instead of enhancing the public nature of documents, is having the opposite effect.	2.7552259949981566
Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand.	2.0469306510897995
It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	2.5645027475825115
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and, in the Netherlands, a value of 86% recycling has now already been achieved.	2.597131501481989
Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries.	2.6346550751272466
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective.	3.1223377367805174
Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons.	3.7463476664411477
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated.	2.78601975532216
Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido.	2.6494569872650287
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying.	4.253139787359629
In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible.	3.0666030608506785
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	2.8853157406052916
In my opinion, it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas.	3.017157662056753
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997.	4.097940947029481
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	2.6352914552860187
Therefore, the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order.	2.410123431140364
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is.	2.696653537397122
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however.	1.6671621250329578
Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today' s agenda. We decided on Monday that the Council' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed.	2.916154554691446
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	2.9819876264237
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty, dependency and alienation with equity, initiative and participation.	2.23233851681367
Too late, too selective and too fragmented: this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community.	2.956639938578493
It is true that it is a stopgap solution, but we must rely on stopgap solutions because, at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.0873253547425863
Thirdly, unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time, tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes.	2.307090317802445
In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas.	2.939636988486076
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	3.0127904886697046
I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law.	2.136358544001159
We have also asked Parliament' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries.	2.6753724166285213
I would like to answer these two questions as follows.	3.3879354144436435
Essentially, the agreement deals with two points: one is the right of the European Parliament to be informed, which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to Article 8 of the decision.	3.0280930003103834
We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas.	2.0844818328419317
We will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted, and most important of all, we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous CAP which is disinheriting them and leading them towards economic decline and the desertion of the countryside.	2.6461588450855067
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	2.409703399753264
Parliament has proposed 4 years, the Commission 7 and the Council 13.	5.955735258335986
Indeed, the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system.	3.6851835456782696
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday.	3.477199812943003
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters.	2.594535213210865
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	2.3536543509807197
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to start a debate at this point. This was just a procedural motion.	2.844632308411473
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	3.174129901570141
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	5.396808773802531
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	1.856952568428885
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe.	2.4521489973813675
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched?	3.8165961817410348
I applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions, not just between Commission and Parliament, but also between these and the Council to underscore the extent of the political challenge.	4.462597963713094
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and, if necessary, abandon the scheme altogether.	2.9036270437949714
We attach crucial importance to applying, if necessary, the new provisions under Article 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty so that a country which, by its actions, infringes fundamental citizens' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the EU' s Council of Ministers removed.	2.8538718123749747
The Commission is new and has to be given time, but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission.	4.415858466132606
The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor.	3.1845255842163485
From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament.	2.926460292832917
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.	3.3300232100468388
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure.	2.4731664095784325
The problems in Europe' s urban areas are getting worse; fortunately, we now have consensus with the Commission.	2.3076042732042112
With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations.	3.93597367875263
The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council.	2.7093859336560655
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	2.5827536887995923
Question No 42 by (H-0817/99):	1.2605856117352525
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	3.012175722480417
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	2.8708286065955035
In connection with this, we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well.	3.0079065152789943
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.4043963999816018
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	1.6831833603994906
Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly.	4.06477395436331
When six European countries have granted the right to vote, the President of this House can venture to extend this right to vote, and eligibility to participate in the municipal and European elections, to all people from outside the Community who have lived in Europe for more than five years.	2.5951135457419277
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal.	2.551962817568594
It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates.	2.735132393010862
The foregoing is the reason for our vote.	4.541861720320476
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet.	1.698469582117933
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.	2.57395291983305
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called "a big bang approach".	2.964197928691572
Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context.	2.5810743145242805
That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation.	2.9855247471537285
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion.	1.6003990792452611
We now come to the third proposal which is for 'Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.	2.9124851763951605
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart.	2.881182275585394
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty.	1.7817633569969493
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement.	4.221362187535486
The affected area is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project.	1.7617886035482786
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, real per capita income in the world' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries. In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher.	2.384569246770458
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed.	3.710146438437099
As is also explained in the present communication, it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis.	2.8706632988102982
That is not correct.	8.455866735661733
This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively.	3.7058317623196046
Firstly, because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives.	2.5898955089302382
I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything.	2.268405855135144
We must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us.	2.5505342442692234
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners.	3.5439991925632515
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally, for example by means of the IMF.	2.551151063146111
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.	1.7040887817017876
Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight.	2.985244055824915
In this respect the Commission communication before us today is opportune, as is the report by Mr Viceconte whom I congratulate.	4.038363544148194
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case.	2.6407996161210128
Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	2.9483281686014453
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right.	3.38953789693127
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	2.397039006852651
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority.	4.4203807301648155
I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	3.184189242871746
I know that this directive may have problems, given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union, as has already been mentioned.	4.188772995994264
We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle.	3.1513710735151643
The European Union intends to permit 5% of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market.	3.26488461838845
These could include withholding Community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a Member State.	1.8416574289066399
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up.	2.631907653987044
This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission.	3.0044826004010172
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel' s request, as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti?	2.0931228520764464
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents, yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity.	2.5262171151919492
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament.	2.6597830347266465
Mr President, as a Member from one of the outermost regions, I must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned, because of the debate on two Community initiatives, URBAN and INTERREG.	5.021456796458876
It should no longer be the case that, although Europe is an economic power, we have no political influence because, when the chips are down, we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it.	3.013116646298043
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either.	3.493497134815999
We will raise that, too, in the representations we make.	3.7458970437273713
It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.	4.745759643354574
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission. To encourage, to assist promotion, to create statistics, to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination.	2.1894068574476684
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	3.8870268955388614
Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity.	3.6472987485613135
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects.	2.368944012243814
Ultimately, we also need to achieve better cooperation, of course, between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts.	3.705689023674567
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro.	3.0880702880886974
I should like to be absolutely categorical.	6.24279637248505
I would ask you once again to work on this.	4.397037590646796
In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation.	2.8606559582384596
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another.	1.475425597048432
I think that your proposal, Madam President, to keep the debate and the vote separate, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date, is a reasonable one.	3.7285331754003663
With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.	3.1296106240012764
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	3.307295931771724
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.	3.3213285163731783
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	2.685074623889717
We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values.	3.2455260625303137
Why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us, but rather expect the usual people, the ones who live there all year, to pay for it and maintain it?	2.653232370703969
The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third.	1.5625207589048578
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises.	3.5541925889644372
To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights.	2.2323297450623687
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated.	1.6647551127023048
It is my intention, as it has always been, to work in cooperation with Parliament, to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results.	3.9271273727448546
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	1.5286989376688482
It is for life.	5.6731124891863045
For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia.	7.868162951102961
It was erroneously included in today' s agenda.	2.4692029472390193
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it.	2.4901658898168777
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters.	1.8175884666828297
When will you make it compulsory?	2.2609419931410226
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	3.2511169270921587
It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue.	3.284424997868238
A start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter, but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists.	2.6702550171313044
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue. If Mr MacCormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning, I will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both Article 11 in general and Article 11(1) in particular.	2.4090315981906283
This is a basic element of the decision.	5.698018146910878
The term 'tourism' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun, sea and holidays, which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level.	2.157999972475078
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are, irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse.	2.2354634491314673
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	2.7648544251029814
That is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in Austria; for the Austrian People' s Party, the ÖVP, wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability. The ÖVP wants to ensure that we continue to meet the Maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit, as we have agreed here.	2.8516240863210047
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation.	1.6202792338756318
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.	2.087891333843377
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique.	1.4207659072978984
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy, our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense, are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole.	3.023827311741727
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland, for example, English companies certainly operate there.	2.0559619577422716
We must live with our consciences."	1.5007508347437362
Madam President, Mr Bolkestein, the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable.	3.7561206219032197
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain)	1.6696848010906933
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety.	5.904562332484299
I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be.	2.3626514443590234
I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments.	3.6245375945116476
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	2.2496922028101016
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.	2.0091457593748627
For our part, we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which, far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency, imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket, which has been imposed on the peoples of Europe.	2.5065752869562337
Unless the necessary means are secured to pursue environmental protection, there is no point on the one hand in continuing to raise the environmental awareness achieved in recent years, and on the other hand in incorporating the environmental dimension in other policies.	2.8733094262136847
As to the healing effect of alcohol - to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference - I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit.	2.437508561401206
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment?	3.2403701734526944
In other words, accession should not be held hostage to a political solution.	3.3716581189122685
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject, and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate!	3.1078313761881775
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	1.937143986473698
We can be proud of a European competition culture, for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality.	3.6925502970301287
Certainly the process has always been very complex, as a result of historical decisions, and these must eventually be rationalised.	2.704490190122228
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt, and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment, as well as social justice.	2.873762095318047
They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries.	2.868778388984387
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	3.5009552133137087
This is the theory behind it, anyway.	3.2838138611757257
I am thinking in particular of countries such as Cuba which are isolated but I know, because I have travelled there extensively, that the Cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world, obtain different information and pass on different information.	2.200836559244681
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.3783433285941222
The current situation is not good.	5.248762057164092
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens.	2.685797131007274
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	3.5972487785753
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	3.274116105473406
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs, of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime, is very political.	2.7131263943829595
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	2.025708157110268
Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase.	3.622965073142402
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	2.6252476783462053
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense.	3.4776133826061373
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	2.0771099621935343
I await with interest developments in Cuba.	1.5290169590827376
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process.	1.7964403996819265
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.	3.1723072312280083
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track.	2.525935643478519
This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage.	2.5023708104011826
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements.	2.4133520379380102
This limited training element has, however, been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times.	2.3616757704785094
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting.	5.123255574536213
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions.	3.4994641473623576
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree.	2.1872436335025163
All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule.	3.3691815801243483
Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance.	2.648904179066488
Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit.	3.0293256496690844
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.	3.558045863692828
The situation in the north is different from that in the south, and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas.	4.272924282089294
One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe.	3.687464925105946
The key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water, the protection of eco systems, the promotion of the sustainable use of water, the control of floods and droughts and the termination of discharging dangerous substances into surface water.	2.672573434098505
Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?)	2.257596242380575
Today, the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union.	2.984158857324447
The Commission would like to stress in particular that, in the drafting of the code, it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman.	4.958914293540484
Thank you very much for your replies, Mr Barnier.	2.8340009462563915
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system.	4.128185903455064
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	4.022674843677235
Until then, there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations.	3.2304404820375905
But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of "privatisation" and "liberalisation"!	3.079134230751706
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision?	3.304019368158519
Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection.	2.746005858929788
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself.	3.952112541639631
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg.	2.8495984288543674
Without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made, we, the European Parliament, would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the Council to implement these decisions in many areas, as well as its lack of common vision and, in particular, the lack of transparency and cooperation with the European Parliament.	3.771459313779193
Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group wonders if the idea of foisting unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen Member States might not be, essentially, flawed.	2.6818814017442207
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	2.947362305781281
It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality.	3.137955275306668
The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies.	2.4945387556245295
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively.	2.7122547124311436
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority.	2.017736201635813
We negotiated with the Commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically-modified organisms in the directive, taking the text on which Directive 70/524 is based as a starting point.	2.546480946978223
Secondly, in my view, while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the Commission - it should be essential. And, since it should be essential, I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training.	3.68872562346826
This means that in terms of quantity management too, we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it.	3.2946686981197857
A key problem is the time factor.	2.644986729684278
(ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war.	2.282083524029688
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms.	2.3292760494274014
This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species.	2.2130101619819187
Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees.	2.9134675362239433
In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments.	1.9222027021070727
It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds.	2.192249324395677
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House.	1.8000323464502068
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	1.3563735036225113
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States.	2.9838109639557056
It is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the Council and Parliament - we will have to identify so-called "negative priorities" and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity.	3.2066466698861453
That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place.	3.291181493809072
I, for my part, have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme, and I have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the European Parliament devoting special attention to them.	3.203116143861993
. (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety.	3.95736217714066
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	2.798131483995173
Europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Yet some applicant countries in central and eastern Europe are taking in gypsy refugees expelled en masse from Belgium.	1.883690849959938
This is what is meant by the term "close-to-zero" .	3.063299645378919
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process.	2.6473709237109913
Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow.	2.0650245438057135
A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.	2.250132303062095
The Union has decided to assist with a further EUR 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, on the basis of an IMF report which estimates that a further EUR 115 million is needed for that reconstruction.	2.659354465510572
You are lucky that Mr Böge' s report only deals with this on the sidelines; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so.	2.066840698693157
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue?	3.0254561881752187
I wholly endorse what the Committee on Budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the Commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way.	2.679711189048679
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	3.390534227934466
Mr President, Commissioner, I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years. I was therefore aware how the situation was developing.	2.245759869707261
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.4043963999816018
As Commissioner Vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches, the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules, which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner, with this disparate agenda, with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation.	2.96819908784891
I am in favour of preventive measures, starting with feeding which is suitable for the species, rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out.	2.3336896995362015
Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	2.3855286456228035
I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods.	2.2582993290345414
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34(2)(b) of the Treaty.	2.450157107205663
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon.	2.9883688782829303
Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996.	1.7789323524832108
The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups.	1.8714181751440258
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool.	2.765400259891896
In the second, LIFE-Environment strand, which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies, the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed.	2.9039345945863513
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years.	1.5882603099632955
The fact is, showing solidarity with Eastern Europe, is all very well, but it is not enough.	2.8626830887899914
They are wrong.	2.4909096783666147
Looking to the future, we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission.	5.202796302618888
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70/524/EEC for the replacement of the authorisations.	3.032629773906266
However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint.	3.4569728697379607
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget.	2.3458544700081143
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views, I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe.	3.718160606645033
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.	3.0074833862370585
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable.	2.2753700991796646
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	2.986087132493236
Mr President, before we begin our discussion, as an Italian MEP - and I believe I also speak on behalf of all Italian MEPs - I should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the German Chancellor, who interfered in Italian internal affairs, when he threatened that Europe would intervene if any neo-fascists became members of the government.	3.067038464924879
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States.	2.3482640407810513
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group, I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission, its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers.	3.475559208716266
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament.	2.385275005389556
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today.	2.8314114912999386
In this connection, the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries.	2.539972551333482
I hope we can have further debates like this.	2.3948681554661793
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	2.7411722003386436
It is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a 'public service' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within European territory to receive the service, and this entitlement must remain an acquired right, an acquis communautaire.	2.5479153476117156
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	2.5679484036573075
The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition.	2.6722829367518113
Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD))	1.9213299226102019
We have no difficulty with the "polluter pays" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level.	2.2247024946874636
We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War.	3.401757407042602
So what do we need to happen immediately?	4.522289627326883
Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG!	2.2877909692941834
Surely this cannot be the role of your, my and the citizens' tax money?	2.7279807131681744
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity.	1.7129594330724112
Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate.	1.7777190424415683
Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view.	3.8898481919001737
Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste.	2.0019579340568185
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions, the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime.	3.047026472563327
It is, above all, the manufacturer' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car' s life-cycle.	3.4645347995129896
The examples are, I hope, all well known. In any case, they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products.	2.6480948428329936
I hope that we can thrash this out.	6.009459409664091
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	1.8868578004266026
And yet our President is a fine economist.	1.8138765485084236
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project.	3.2153440133391684
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	5.213986588479645
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty, the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which, to this end, studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions. The Court also guarantees proper financial management.	2.5622707827023072
Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here.	4.938261723310511
Mr President, with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon, I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them, that is, the URBAN programme.	4.691060669271348
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement.	2.6802550346944076
This is my main concern in this matter.	2.4298187804760816
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted.	3.006463741764547
Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki.	3.93992819624126
Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget.	2.9029971623852586
So what should we do?	2.8362693170996174
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed, you will be doing us a great service.	2.7262585529366983
Report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999	3.2756253224034135
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.700461282468465
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.	3.738584705586597
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	3.3078129335364554
This situation can be achieved over a period of time.	2.6429274854431712
So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women.	2.4212030902724155
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	2.822517293605312
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this.	2.522072202906874
Although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to ACP-EU relations, the European Union also plans to police immigration, as article 13 hints, in order to justify the policy of the European states against illegal immigrants.	3.261808727255548
In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime.	2.751010938139178
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	3.9301477092263526
Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities.	2.291535464650783
Brussels, which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task, now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset.	2.043885092132525
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements.	2.2002589521400124
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	2.180834755858494
Furthermore, I have asked the president of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, that is to say the Office in Alicante, to comment further on this new question and I can, as a result, inform the honourable Member as follows, on behalf of the Office:	3.3606777898260383
What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function.	2.8315065623599214
Mr President, acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe.	3.0404542727875907
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	1.288342709821954
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO.	2.1772021493598053
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms.	2.4637068086518643
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative.	2.2095784021366653
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers.	3.8609653733259415
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.	2.645782732638737
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area, for example and the United States, is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here.	3.6829379713685015
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society, economic policy and reforms.	3.1282504249824044
However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government.	2.9222898492940845
First of all, the Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement contains, as everyone knows, a concrete timetable for the implementation of Israel' s commitments. This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements.	2.9011542161617023
I would, however, remind you, and this is my final point, that the Commission is not the only Community institution.	5.02776188463417
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House.	5.958022339634177
The proposal, as formulated by the Council and subsequently amended by the Commission, provides for a convention based on three titles: the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters rogatory; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance; the third and last provides for and codifies the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a State other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be intercepted.	2.392005471104473
By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere.	1.9216330522086198
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors.	2.329723107030616
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries, and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system.	3.7099196145341717
As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter.	2.696755166492943
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict.	3.445254964966475
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true, and that figures do not lie.	3.58476249139078
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	3.8234307635530165
And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region.	3.1998840076158768
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	2.293603092492777
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty.	3.143566657359415
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small.	2.2140651710043473
We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	2.6854349333991
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro	1.7991558689584528
In spite of everything, all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society, and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation.	2.7168069197889895
These are the modern means to be used.	4.563033527138935
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	2.436128753876398
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle.	3.2259977481700326
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna.	2.1302485175228334
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out.	2.688749928738775
But the Member States failed to cooperate.	4.19363762391199
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman's office.	3.147896653769361
Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO.	3.278046238210053
Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement.	4.5216843655230825
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade.	3.1908396758658673
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU.	2.2670412534039275
We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation.	2.542682380327232
As the Commissioner knows, farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities.	2.8311882007023
In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended.	3.492460863115963
In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly.	2.653508818692089
Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe.	3.4547009050965243
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter.	3.2704877368726875
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted.	2.806310304094739
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects.	2.1380629176643158
Second part	72.17482167067989
So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.	2.780773154916634
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today.	1.9195134843430794
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	2.9397101138530486
This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers.	2.5280855253237555
Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent.	2.9632016343506162
This report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100, the ten so-called "strongest" regions reached an average of 158, and the ten so-called "weakest" regions reached a figure of around 50.	2.0290938579599365
It is in this spirit that I have three criticisms to make. These must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new Europe, as proclaimed ambitiously by the title of the Commission document and Mr Prodi' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric.	3.1400106962055596
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights.	1.7106548365503345
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique.	3.8351133883769117
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states.	1.652058905006373
Let us ensure, Mr President, Commissioner, that this time we really do learn the lesson, even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down.	2.9276200340663197
Last year' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues.	1.9168540496438446
We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.	2.926676012538677
The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services.	3.072218350091091
Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister.	2.299989393531439
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	3.0247038355702944
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.	3.061027539571769
According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds.	2.472932405552292
However, they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire.	3.921098727105961
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries.	1.940692014433058
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	3.7680905806430562
And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees.	1.4074383135748196
In Finland, an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic, with the words "Good morning, Madam President."	2.9387419816450633
It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	2.2183352256728424
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book.	2.0422620954598845
Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture.	3.4468494036987503
Mr President, first of all, I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan' s very expert work on this report.	2.887791524845146
Should we complain about this delay?	1.5356175626912554
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues.	2.795777545380966
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	3.1956081048402085
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims.	3.292115331464234
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	2.6496300026391117
Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious.	2.7926349365452157
In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time.	2.39611291642586
In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council.	2.6244719825445015
We want EQUAL to go ahead.	1.9124618786614707
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward.	2.9517334001421833
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament.	3.7595196878369705
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries.	1.9453307264564739
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council.	2.5386894558228197
This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action.	4.037286458417266
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese, the Chinese leadership, is Communist first and Chinese second.	3.043788035426231
Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims.	3.6113964808068335
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	3.2413687137934097
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.	2.8452302374739076
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force.	3.180727473998023
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	2.8689561472837264
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding.	3.145679033314089
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling.	3.9984760726243995
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue.	2.7246693904924375
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected?	2.272795404950014
Ladies and gentlemen, we must challenge the monopoly the world' s speculative elite have on planning the world' s economy by remaining outside the tax system.	2.551043447381315
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week.	1.82931475659643
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment.	3.090442352921205
.	77.3301660757284
Three annual crops of Moroccan and African workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly EUR 2 million; and yet 60% of them have no running water in a region where, as we know, the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer.	2.1606752303484877
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management.	2.9372115231308036
Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere.	3.1594064711670913
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters.	2.2665686515846697
For this reason, I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level.	3.2463448113620292
Report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS))	2.193913068393041
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs.	3.331066909271231
We are now endeavouring, at huge cost, to get the country back on its feet again and help its people, and rightly so.	2.4019651130307307
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with.	3.165506802853363
Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts.	4.376382846967877
In any event, speaking now as a Greek, I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places.	2.5841653191843936
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability.	1.8320167414228274
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions.	3.440542267862024
Madam President, the Socialist Group proposes the following oral amendment.	4.0387445786496485
Mr President, I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair, in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative.	3.119531583238085
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000?	2.525297619867588
Bankruptcy procedures	48.116547780453246
Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything?	2.1399712422035946
Furthermore, the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States.	4.193565545737573
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	2.855878783044491
For the sake of our credibility, we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the EU are different from human rights elsewhere in the world.	3.0563145237969644
The French text contains the word "refuse" and the English text the word "shall" , which means that the Commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public, for example in my own country.	3.271142948078268
Regarding information and training, in the past this budget line has been allocated for information, communication and training.	3.031329173493231
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.	3.437934047455803
First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: "The future of social protection" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk.	3.0058006498813663
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.	1.9851397063787743
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history.	2.5020704467381565
Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing.	3.0762729476471784
The impression that Africans get, namely that they are inferior world citizens, is not unfounded.	3.5996768475273178
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions.	3.1648422873796855
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year?	2.089119040442474
Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible.	3.7053107761965993
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs.	1.9393155265124395
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report.	2.803008569153311
There, the border question is obviously central.	1.699360505682737
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	3.132156650060153
Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests	4.522231031927703
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	2.7070305416674043
With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' .	2.5360840016782125
The conclusions of the Tampere special European Council, as Mr Hernandez Mollar said, clearly illustrated the will of the Heads of State and Government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based, with particular emphasis on the Union' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants.	3.356953431287289
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another.	3.1059810448253478
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre.	2.388831985213263
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy.	3.3842164653974685
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Gallagher' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee. It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur.	2.83690572582118
This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States.	3.66753329819241
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	5.2299808746186995
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.	2.6176261239068697
However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.	3.005314696515403
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it, we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament, the social partners and non-governmental organisations.	3.93030761713184
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car.	1.747544238693466
Mr Beazley, my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise.	2.8469835020872996
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	2.8076791239450904
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	2.0103119574990034
The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers.	2.753617226727008
We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies.	2.190965789997544
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to.	3.9105037555484614
The facts are clear.	2.635805929177641
We have recently had cause to talk about the 'polluter pays' principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.	1.963364796721462
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	4.497345023336767
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	3.6770598119065045
I look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the Members of Parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available.	2.348953954447373
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	1.7715805140921657
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	3.6022185474159305
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.	3.2422713538641523
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water.	1.8435766862801708
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union.	2.7844061529021595
Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around.	2.442091440007693
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems.	3.219037704897804
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.	3.1677196999689854
In the new millennium, with new global problems requiring new global solutions, they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now, rather than why it has not been done in the past.	3.0126736948549113
But, probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members, the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level: a framework decision.	3.2743929994349625
In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres.	3.6749615148888757
Values should take precedence over power.	1.7949894830007942
The issue here is whether a European manufacturer should pay EUR 250 million or a Korean manufacturer, say, EUR 2 million.	2.316299999570331
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems.	2.4957121782029894
We need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption.	3.1086544043834405
At my hearing last September, I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper.	1.8341958919109171
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency.	2.459794917339293
My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me.	2.461647142318434
I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament.	3.165749784085164
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention.	2.4609748553981317
The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified.	2.8759836386826283
I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe.	2.865954068341828
I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy.	2.703021812460018
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability.	2.504178608826004
. (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	3.5710551638330625
With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.	3.029792645262926
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM.	3.4554826061908277
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council.	3.0187052732335182
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on.	2.9128575802929295
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services.	2.599487349491487
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round.	2.96039180383698
Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened.	6.868757664123234
How many people found work?	2.3396030548978537
Amendment No 11 replaces 'government or municipal officials' with 'government officials' .	2.0518154970177283
We want the UN embargo, which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports, to stop.	2.412733784528053
It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women.	3.0287847847442597
Madam President, this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa, who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States.	3.116366028668043
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.	3.203886951540113
I hope that the accession money available to assist Cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in Cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given.	2.381641633308561
That concludes the debate.	1.5326323786505276
It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale.	2.6493234545974875
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective, as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal, Greece and Spain.	2.5465388265296585
Every day, new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo, and there are hundreds of violations of the UN' s Resolution 1244.	2.5042450520918456
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use.	3.5924772117949617
It specifies the necessary coordination between LEADER + and Community cooperation and partnership programmes such as INTERREG, PHARE, Sapard or MEDA.	1.644270256966851
Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area.	2.930624785750553
Unfortunately, in my case, he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer.	3.073006621878568
Fortunately, the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened, and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject, to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs, in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office.	2.5494113552628526
At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations.	2.088939209713448
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change.	4.442356878443567
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	3.0385276357284767
Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council.	3.544065681265846
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	1.7717136272728105
For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work.	3.4913447958915538
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law.	2.9769311398517435
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	3.7997577281937276
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken.	4.333674341564601
.	77.3301660757284
Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever.	1.7889525873749248
Financial control' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate.	2.383823918627944
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control.	3.477136835847027
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.20885043331848
The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles.	1.9569319560147358
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy.	1.7213936189804782
However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct.	4.605191826254799
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.	3.4179465876937
Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that.	3.303451425508812
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying, especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union' s rural development policy.	2.81022706516432
Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided.	3.1973788826316403
There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	3.411450018530863
The basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation, to use the carrot-and-stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water.	2.656454531685487
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	2.644164702386684
. (DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations.	2.9432915184749118
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union, where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures.	2.093054316525742
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured.	2.0064033428198913
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino, for your valuable contribution to this Question Time.	3.0471469128170003
Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets.	2.5687711691222543
I too should like to ask the European Union to put its own house in order here, i.e. to call on Member States which still have gold mines to commission expert reports, so that we know just what the situation is.	3.0760520328780903
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now.	2.3684137563153147
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view.	2.0227802455733226
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government.	2.2818858737086347
Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures.	2.4318959856960727
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area?	2.985370835103409
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily.	2.6828549062602396
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail.	3.510981086077754
The experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the Commissioners from belonging to political groups.	2.111791756559905
Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start.	2.9710036109864006
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation.	3.6714929545235373
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated.	3.1382392617745856
However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation.	2.5715808162037948
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment.	3.120434934783466
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	3.3689222752117325
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage, namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted.	2.3462231066076566
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees.	3.8866165173304985
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999.	2.966163124355954
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period.	1.9767233675347318
This communication must contain a clear timetable.	1.5628457011231376
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	3.0799119783978104
I must highlight the part of the report which states that, in 1975, with regard to the size of bluefin tuna, a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15% tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic.	2.7827274340281605
I urge the Chinese again to do so.	2.6027240568333245
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	2.612211333454754
On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State.	2.9944058101234754
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	2.4612127283420606
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness.	1.493152298676558
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people.	2.2747207206701834
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously.	2.5738108954243657
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor, whereas in France alone, over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy.	1.9943802375219193
We should, at any rate, judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words.	2.832708928393351
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.	4.8976326794876925
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations.	3.902957085406879
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.6634238620972148
So we must practise selective fishing.	1.8306871932021203
Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive.	4.545185051074729
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	2.3420231432836482
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that, as yet, it has been left unused.	4.787301151439626
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this.	3.537907203526698
These areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families, elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity, and families facing difficulties; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society.	1.806796972653862
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky' s whereabouts and his state of health.	2.2611184797776596
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	2.152495166126563
In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives.	2.9821283209225316
This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	4.215391957075623
As you know, both we and the Council have addressed this issue appropriately.	2.9946158192154098
I hope you will help us.	3.184361639478427
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life.	2.6438782186454426
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	7.817021967730336
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital.	2.192991130932204
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context.	3.5643727925017252
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet, so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point.	3.5354043245608544
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of?	1.4244260445586066
Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old.	1.756035191144743
I believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of Europol, and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved.	3.807896076060761
Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency.	6.117533759484953
These are questions which we should all be asking, but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations.	2.596125744515062
We are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 USD 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take-overs - restrictive practices are being held in check, not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the USA or Japan, or others, until we get the international competition law we so badly need.	2.198047619391269
My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy.	3.6294027259765778
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	3.1286735221920434
We are sure that there will be an important "reform dividend" as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources.	2.7977887599783524
VOTE	21.75018985665072
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions.	3.013474311043597
Their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new CAP' s disastrous consequences and the disorientation of small and medium-scale farmers, and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives.	2.327003579727905
Mr Corbett, I have not received any notification.	4.9299467628336195
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent.	2.239205655819049
I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway.	4.736298159311044
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary.	2.048633796744529
This increased awareness does not, however, affect identity alone.	2.5741168372709775
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	2.925745375306312
The problem has been overcome.	2.1653469761779327
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled.	4.271783500165328
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled.	2.837898750976327
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message.	1.9393678445177118
But seriously.	411.0140801047986
Union Economy (1999)	1.1528548695420215
I am making a personal commitment to do so.	1.8663968166384874
Combating certain fish diseases	1.1952175487610375
Our priorities (i.e. the "left-overs" ) must be:	2.047977737722017
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	3.1434304702950553
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	2.617571571759653
But they might accidentally do great damage.	1.538827579709294
I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	2.7899384392212263
I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers.	2.601562954852484
We must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation. We must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process, so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries, but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world.	2.9071685240624734
Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the day before yesterday, there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme, which I would ask you to comment on.	4.028458730635721
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises.	3.533696786334972
As for us, we our bound by the terms of the texts: a maximum of four months.	2.760868351339539
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster.	2.604284098994213
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	3.2096908962077415
Supposed draft environmental directive: "European Parliament and Council Directive establishing the obligation to maintain, during winter, a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets, squares and parks of the cities of Europe ".	2.0185493267572183
My question, which the President-in-Office did not answer, is this: if this inquisition procedure begins, in which the main or, if you will, one of the main people interrogated and probably found guilty will be Mr Solana, who is today the High Representative of the European Union' s Common Foreign and Security Policy, should it not be, if that happens, if the General Prosecutor of the Tribunal is determined to begin the process, that Mr Solana' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean?	2.75130636549973
Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a "scoreboard" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States.	3.726035477558095
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	2.1466251378727215
And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?	2.3142548270747136
Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement.	2.6612906004301027
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.	2.659153969671307
A single key is to suffice in future.	1.479949122419824
Minister Gomes, I have, of course, heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency.	3.8533872637061757
The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values.	2.0654096385531515
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work.	3.8951741976822456
Numerous policies have already gone in this direction, albeit laboriously, and many more still need to do so before Europe, in terms of subsidiarity, is seen as one house, not only by its own people, but also by those in the candidate countries.	3.4476520300051043
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	2.453008546022988
Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity.	2.7257005091016353
This Parliament' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties, making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes.	2.779594773568852
Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure.	1.8625143847417478
Again, I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission' s accountability for the future.	3.2556058009884863
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	3.5454756601322694
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.	2.0275593212794196
The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not.	5.479271090916297
On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.	3.489015995056867
But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is.	2.416338980894441
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	1.6118050580991665
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations, the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market.	2.185090794969837
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks, which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long, to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact.	2.45963927096059
However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission.	4.290702733787538
Nevertheless, as my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions, when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately, different considerations must be taken into account.	2.3616134126603634
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this.	3.6343856458779533
I shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution.	2.5057892035561347
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation, and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject.	3.726922317754308
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	2.8055696172712783
Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation.	2.953205954563558
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter.	1.8394618964509766
The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea.	3.4381402075147807
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved, even silent, specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed.	1.8625591757625897
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender.	2.3723560895178313
Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old.	2.7964525035960834
We should not be so politically partisan.	4.677400562355403
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.	3.039906500916436
The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion.	2.2216750342059526
However, we must be vigilant in the face of global operators, against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits.	3.0485283500084757
Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them.	2.878055518964027
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century.	2.653585626319645
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	2.737786909480968
There is a problem, however, which we need to address together.	9.32221898031003
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.4550725128474453
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD))	1.9896402463635772
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.5393383587511975
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99.	2.8856627162211237
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends.	3.4119213454263275
It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.	3.2721140318130773
The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	2.4724336172977437
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls.	2.272307981488987
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	1.7968727357534926
Mr President, the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance.	3.9217540130913653
One is to adopt the Commission' s own excellent, outstanding econometric analysis, and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible.	2.6527179558862404
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above.	2.5186845377305493
Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself.	2.7026027048057593
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two.	2.0644436077807384
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion.	1.6769990765910805
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians.	4.1338812922349595
This is the crux of the matter.	3.433444851626867
There is time.	1.8774726511046689
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties.	3.0853333369724774
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	3.0961256597155895
Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate.	2.782545525934154
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong.	1.418280796835543
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based, by means of the INTERREG initiative, on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent.	3.154155365624183
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage.	1.6765015562252015
I cannot accept this.	3.206980016224383
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products.	1.6525039925506024
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	3.4089648808272583
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	4.167670311306325
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links.	2.338797465828646
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.2866170460046753
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law.	2.9648481923481538
We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with.	5.587173894072102
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	2.0963510658401825
With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater.	2.880371431601929
Would it be possible for the EU to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment, out of Community funds, for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost?	2.4995907251539355
To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	3.587300019081703
The Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, is not here yet, but I hope, and expect, that she will arrive in the next few minutes.	3.32782762343958
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	3.7136608543968257
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one.	3.555905695824579
As I have said, we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in Europe - without intrusion from interceptions, without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in Europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than administer justice, and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds inconvenient.	2.374368137756723
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	2.169097744349956
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	4.472633259578269
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again.	3.395956211391814
I can testify to this remarkable work.	1.5640700563021632
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts.	4.618156324783739
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation.	4.399243423753328
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	3.045201168757979
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind.	3.2675431946931477
Mr President, we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform.	2.6658726320335338
There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk.	4.001864430193871
It has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to issue an auditor' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful, and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we, as Members of this Parliament, were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned.	2.791134873876886
In my view, this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis.	3.0165154009485495
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives, but Parliament' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained.	3.088687951138193
At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative.	3.2145359615070754
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	2.0651321100187126
The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion.	2.3583480692213614
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	2.4241875971147846
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities.	4.184246009886929
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society, and also important from the point of view of effectiveness, for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently.	3.053305779389396
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers.	2.987471625341056
Moreover, what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action?	2.576300059812563
We have achieved nothing so far, and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union.	4.152527380836317
Will it discuss the matter?	1.6688526936726407
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.	2.3803346887925767
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles.	2.142500951987819
Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure.	3.6851966405346275
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas.	2.38029895137471
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	4.228511056219881
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	2.2908624640746753
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	3.789299141114944
Regions which, culturally and economically, sometimes match the interest of some Member States.	1.984361891985851
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission' s humanitarian aid policy.	3.3778328967549798
However, more work is needed on this.	1.9888221460173865
. (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.5934961174345776
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years.	2.6127341837158773
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	2.427720215212121
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.	3.0117525943913503
We also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism.	2.5618528603629245
We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination.	2.6736036835018333
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B, especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy.	3.4169716346936494
Mr President, having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market, the House now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the Union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other' s competence.	2.629551441235083
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not, at the same time, available for critical scrutiny by the public.	3.632626350026228
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important.	1.8638394432866754
We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics.	3.096879988051048
Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	2.0329322207446823
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	3.4293389976885744
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink: as I said a few moments ago, it is also economic and political globalisation itself.	3.140460662733957
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation.	1.709444263089324
On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise.	2.8063102608824093
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.	3.5188955593977114
Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment.	3.8989110494626247
Where would Europe' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture?	1.7846634258593024
When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness.	3.2148222832371456
Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone.	2.9126664873101658
No action has been taken on our report which unanimously proposed a European framework status for assistant spouses.	2.025670977912464
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act.	2.7759160534439054
Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals.	3.620867414542646
Both of them have done a first-class job.	2.8233632180703765
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	3.6333090371308767
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	3.3337978218794855
It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress.	3.676984703355939
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive.	2.912467899825804
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.	2.7119502054372924
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem.	2.646908842376277
There is one thing, however, that we cannot deny, and that is that Mr Kouchner' s efforts to return Kosovo' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive.	3.28161259775706
Mr President, Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, without wishing to compete with the Ministers as regards emotions, I have to say that I am not moved, rather I am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the Union!	3.3967612467417663
I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg.	1.7487894697500468
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government' s agreement, ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire.	2.145663200302108
However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement.	2.7580995934258112
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' .	1.936251675772483
However, the financial controllers must work independently.	4.520744504210709
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment.	2.4416445735925967
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings.	2.135538686554679
It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, "I am the one that the Americans phone up" .	2.516995182872052
Because they have fewer opportunities.	2.666739015885763
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures, as indicated previously.	2.7349268048030653
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age.	3.38481722880741
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading.	2.792816330773876
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country.	2.381417669357649
Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist.	3.1511765484201852
I urge you to look seriously at this problem.	2.2121122333078245
As I have said, we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues.	3.700883693130845
Furthermore, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999.	3.091028679969544
In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements.	2.020508145204259
Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	2.2227062888454037
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	2.600395445941806
We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers.	3.8008345236668197
To conclude, the next five years will be crucial.	3.312952588857257
Report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/2000 - 1999/0240(CNS))	1.7669994386487085
However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable.	3.7279839618305695
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to focus on the point of internal reform.	4.467665039349992
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits.	2.644866965888262
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments.	2.239975878848067
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	2.68986106705862
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	2.736244345921968
I welcome Mr Barnier' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced.	3.7053042093768584
We have to lay down the rules of play today, before we all lose.	3.481922389959885
For example, if one product has been approved, similar products should also be approved.	3.1437360915399952
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	3.8319929331569216
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle.	2.3270732783657664
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	3.2303735970618224
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable.	4.494935880760436
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	2.345762234581124
In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast.	2.7048344148449095
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism, both to local economies and as a factor of European integration.	3.4257919154588667
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome.	1.7298998188018555
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	2.9125586543293096
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	3.4840783606387613
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections.	4.45482045485823
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement.	3.0898639545432487
Let us be honest.	2.2851836978685163
The widely quoted Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the repeal of membership rights from a Member State where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established, is, of course, only a kill or cure remedy, an ultimum remedium, which, in the case of Austria, can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective, and by way of warning.	3.179404488438593
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	2.1355910581999904
On behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the Council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible.	2.9727784998103637
Madam President, the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities.	3.6488917853927454
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	2.8226358893004195
If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' .	2.938482190137118
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal.	3.039210677369872
Madam President, particularly out of respect for you, for myself and for this House, I did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question. However, as a Member of this House, as general secretary of a party in the Basque Country and as an ordinary citizen of Spain, I will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own, which has a long democratic tradition, and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years.	3.277362713167246
It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive?	2.745026044509315
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda.	2.5199580548877143
In June of last year Europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism.	1.975112335416251
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds.	3.409670999457319
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team.	2.379049414226948
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana.	2.91669009429825
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	3.704665301676618
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem.	3.2762828498162593
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly, but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval.	1.6418226166386425
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention.	3.589983573616656
However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens.	3.1107423139500088
Does that give me hope for the year 2000?	2.3525401218726483
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa.	2.9198097849589915
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding.	2.967146901917537
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	3.2567457156842723
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded?	3.296216697098188
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women, or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies?	2.095200588414312
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested.	3.6700367203245325
In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least.	2.248750884939433
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions.	3.1196564134338662
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force.	2.2427412064954466
I am also grateful, at the risk of being repetitive, to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which, if she will allow me to say so, she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating.	3.4970697335127396
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur.	3.1351648551197906
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs.	2.015480917761154
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly.	3.3549275970209984
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results.	2.7652242124280697
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo, that is to say, to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States.	2.1572928870621024
Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars.	2.8469783629378047
.	77.3301660757284
When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.	2.1644227715182365
In rural areas, for many years, even before the Irish Free State came into existence, we sometimes had this service of a post office.	2.438872907843345
Next, we have flags of convenience.	5.029363949077148
In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	3.0327374843378765
It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place.	3.9629305499817553
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council.	3.099784451646107
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.	2.789473680959927
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	3.2829060594485187
That was the charm of LEADER, and that should please not be lost!	3.965105345569237
There is, therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union, a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself.	3.9357033265775403
Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making.	2.5353654766721796
There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment.	2.9632811469950573
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	2.642645326789196
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	2.70392725776067
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº.	2.356371345745917
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	3.6252931920531313
Mr President, this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward, with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time.	3.1597247176862133
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation.	4.573267368353891
In the light of the fact that 50% of unemployment in the Union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - I need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative.	3.6782482064733713
Unfortunately, his text has not survived the vote.	2.3359661747354616
Commissioner, we must be consistent.	8.57363502361283
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	3.008724204445365
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians?	2.122117775098989
We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy.	2.70780850622099
Clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget bidding race which is particularly mistimed when the convergence criteria for EMU are imposing a very strict slimming regime on the national budgets.	1.881626637541095
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie.	3.0049001243074724
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with.	2.112602827072528
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment.	2.4347822305357676
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud.	2.696264335795312
Essentially - and with legal change - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the Financial Controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that Directors-General are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the European Union budget.	2.521270151806079
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity.	1.6957273328428588
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union.	3.306939523650654
It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo.	2.261005477384017
If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002.	3.7299560503864924
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years.	2.516006888842994
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme.	1.352038090507402
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far.	2.6829281048820954
On behalf of the House, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament.	5.580406414801115
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.	2.284505531664661
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.	3.517476443160358
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	3.134046632544991
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled.	1.8901806888700372
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	3.3205497470541117
In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged.	3.248134373296294
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources.	1.8402849176348013
Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.	2.401205183761318
I and my colleague Dominique Souchet, who is well versed in this matter, have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of SMEs and craft trades within the framework of INTERREG, the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and I welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously.	3.4010278841625974
Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	2.7552114739371087
Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan.	1.454848782934732
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	4.456853377037647
However, let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues: the death penalty, Cuba and China.	2.1359192382089094
The government of the United States, or of Israel?	4.658631051243435
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies.	3.451707295727488
As Members of the European Parliament, we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it.	3.528988277638553
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where, when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union.	2.476339197797433
Apart from a few exceptions, the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party will vote in favour of the committee' s amendments, and of course our own.	2.854012229115626
In other words, this is an important facet of public health protection, which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base, not Article 37, as proposed by the Commission.	3.723415226739145
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	2.781236811593642
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House.	2.107383062321945
Mr Kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but, at the same time, it is entirely unclear, at this moment when we have to make a decision, what, for example, happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or Parliament.	2.812836038906158
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established?	3.920275634581858
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime, for which they are being persecuted.	2.6689800796997956
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9.	3.304676900158419
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	2.7884445493887364
This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy.	2.3427075254808005
Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act.	3.317017711912966
There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector.	4.204095979083025
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	2.889033890319878
As far as Mr Papayannakis' question is concerned, in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment, the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment.	4.365137227051114
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	2.876822000170591
In my view, it is, therefore, immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and, consequently, to study and approve the provisions referred to here.	2.3489538874577476
Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too.	2.1382334843476123
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	4.13366919736672
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	3.576668581978792
This is very much on their minds.	3.330876063538036
Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish.	2.5886002347846158
Despite this, he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question.	1.8606818314323057
All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it.	1.7969238358072037
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible.	3.0745575246649746
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	3.096362951037762
This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient.	2.8759331464951723
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	2.664712254348585
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?	2.498478008762905
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	3.9554033996045233
When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good.	2.4828659799672446
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river.	3.119930963648195
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life.	2.526236670388919
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations, depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988.	2.098063058629688
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure.	2.611458771439163
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars.	2.740197283041436
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish.	2.3302200731973
On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion.	2.7087066521293255
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	2.533924436234605
In such cases, there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers, thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy.	2.632023832887951
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice.	2.166632869690766
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority.	3.7681207482368135
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	3.1990548118052886
Beyond this, we have concerns that the "flexibility" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present.	3.2189554363479638
It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it.	2.873034802898204
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission.	2.179861495970833
It also inspires a few political comments.	3.8814292053060755
Lastly, I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us.	3.0034296858183316
We are concerned, therefore, as others have said, at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society' s most excluded, by aiming for a very narrow definition of "refugee".	3.0097393506769206
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	3.5949202856104874
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997.	3.715086188611307
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives.	2.5703774407465407
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement.	2.612161834238849
Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time.	3.2143810024223005
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax.	1.9541683874636127
Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union.	3.147336735713726
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation.	2.4737504122529854
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them.	1.9428548610126601
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments.	1.6598030812356657
What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	3.9250283433682673
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind, and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere.	4.354444701217148
As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat.	2.1239610924514345
In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well.	2.070227804763015
Mr President, only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement.	3.5929874029975246
Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive.	3.0461143614859845
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women.	2.5679052578694828
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more.	3.657399700863092
The amended text will then read, and again I must read it in English, which is the lingua franca of our Parliament: 'transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with' , etc.	2.3557053703813815
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	2.418028951928312
For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020.	2.496778472927126
This is part of risk management.	2.790939156998522
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	2.3516559840097337
Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage.	2.0820721975053975
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making.	2.6433919052322783
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today.	2.8758447317871885
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation.	1.733112767855383
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	3.5006665825742247
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	3.5342986107534338
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	1.772237961600547
What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union.	2.4244167617146677
- (PT) Mrs Lucas, I was not present at the debate you are referring to.	2.405247277386871
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing.	2.8916564934537807
Which is why the environmental aspect, which is becoming a matter of urgency, must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs.	3.5391173161305765
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	3.019705683749452
Terrorism, whatever form it takes, is unacceptable.	1.788771989063772
I have mentioned the example of social services before: nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer, including the pensioner in an old people' s home, and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition, whether that is the right course.	2.7110370141683386
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them.	2.459009288040446
What other explanation could there be for omitting women?	1.6820299981169888
First, streamlining.	1.224018089996612
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.	2.8812264566392205
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve.	2.7787808192443286
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers.	2.769741170062044
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy.	3.009186530033485
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	2.9519941628138513
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.	4.20440826985464
The Commission did not do that.	1.9055197051329098
Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will.	3.169355234495923
Recently, because of political developments in Austria, there is growing unease within Europe. Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue.	2.8397478688373714
The first is the issue of the media' s influence.	7.721960931867693
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found.	2.6001918124537355
In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania.	3.0703256557965894
In any event, the outcome is in your hands.	2.5690259925658228
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative, Álvaro de Soto.	2.306191214852908
Inevitably, that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended.	2.367292198536917
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment.	2.479356511043535
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity.	1.9736367419548693
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis.	3.8096282530982313
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	2.232093331122356
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	1.9549467229268487
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region.	2.788350047259415
It is important that business has legal certainty.	2.153402205096677
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world.	2.9992620060747663
As I have said, numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - I am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team.	2.3837450714560577
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus.	1.8713950561825423
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	4.308246420795913
It has clear, ambitious objectives.	1.5782717180677766
Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens.	2.3450518059564374
Furthermore, he considers that "genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document, official or otherwise, which is affixed to or accompanies the additive" .	2.4513261017670964
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.	2.736672201653367
We sometimes regulate things which could, by and large, remain subsidiary.	1.6023803676229922
Unfortunately, this is not true of them all, but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report.	4.302574770544432
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period, I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations.	2.5800576853286676
There is no backbone, and no teeth.	4.253593617328237
I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming.	2.858815002410061
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority.	4.216343023337539
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.	2.7172621504670227
Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.	2.228073624608898
The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria.	2.381657335577172
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992: this is the topic of this debate.	3.2872601583957026
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter.	4.2703057196426935
That is what we expect of you in the next five years.	3.440774058467069
Some of these parties, despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic, adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right, either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy, if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment, and generally making their lives more difficult.	2.4316007567966627
We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again.	3.245124354923055
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations.	1.6747721373070865
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved.	2.393685629668484
If you ratify ...	2.4723016332397125
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements.	2.3753622716279756
I also hope that, if there is any life in outer space, as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn, it was tuned in to Mr Havel' s speech as well.	3.244415780250464
But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.	3.237826051575044
This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it.	3.4705101794206987
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future.	3.636623379454409
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN, is it not about time you abandoned your traditional, conservative views on refugees and immigrants?	2.172248146510795
In my opinion, we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems, also deriving from American legislation, which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector.	2.496596370577836
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within.	2.176436982136393
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	3.1301597834337347
Lastly, I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area, as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground.	3.241359649184111
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, as expressed at Tampere.	2.7443215404972165
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	2.1715461512093355
This is what intelligent restructuring is about.	2.61806901795797
I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic.	2.513417436086137
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.	2.0311111810440075
Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important.	2.045324580351015
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy.	2.9394416488375246
Incidentally, many thanks to Mr Scharping, the Chairman of the European Social Democrats, for withdrawing the call to take part in demonstrations in Austria from his homepage and therefore not advising anarchists in favour of violent action to go to Vienna tomorrow.	2.709515215916075
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union.	1.8074725262471079
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas.	2.751961777471276
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament' s corresponding powers in this area.	3.46262287501971
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of, and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often.	3.6901146043960917
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing.	4.204667329322536
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which, in seeking to introduce greater flexibility, run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative.	3.53956727129994
Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed.	3.82614842050002
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed.	2.2880042641599365
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam.	2.576940259430621
However, the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	3.5581213236218057
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport.	3.1779655722665647
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time.	1.7989277862545794
We therefore welcome the Commission' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs.	3.2096209957047432
That is why it is so important.	4.561593104563888
Mr President, the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts.	4.143114573165086
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group.	3.592669931455494
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date.	2.4615427972294293
This is one of the aims that LIFE-Environment must achieve. Thirdly, the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment' s priorities is an extremely positive step.	2.9267272802773174
It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way, particularly in Directive 90/220.	3.257028742668337
I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted.	2.360848040847247
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	2.36575312185334
Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness.	3.821268856588695
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.	2.122105054308017
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union. That, however, is another problem altogether.	2.6755875558188316
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	2.8610016759435553
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	2.515607233560073
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures.	2.770740692814277
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment.	2.0044624210001714
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.	4.069622261223337
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study.	2.0979913349530572
So far, the promises which have been made are still, however, to be fulfilled, especially where transparency is concerned.	3.6037137693649326
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this.	2.6842551045723946
That is why he deserves special mention!	3.4163904999843213
Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past.	2.622005778447796
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting.	2.223014340503879
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree, things may be different with this report.	2.803193790033144
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel.	2.0198311514292873
Well, the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face.	1.6752466856552541
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for, or advising, the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level.	1.774477213581256
This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations.	2.0057287995813264
On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed.	4.58928993866068
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included.	3.245567490225224
Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven.	5.634345950095816
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are.	2.9743885123335576
In this field the Commission, in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February.	3.4092635385506234
The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.	2.4450341049510578
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them.	2.7031908248491963
Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held.	3.2549816762441313
The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market.	2.836374210870306
We are well aware that, in the European Union, a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation. With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility, the validity of the objectives of these directives, and their capacity to be implemented.	3.4017034895793876
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe.	2.42971596183882
Direct business to consumer contact will supplement, and sometimes also reduce, the currently, nearly exclusive business to business relationship.	1.6012479798486041
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	2.8437993707170994
There was no majority for this at the time.	3.2780880424003547
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us.	2.2647130198285463
That was how it was.	1.7020009662060451
Action is not limited to legislation.	1.961649592832541
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species, such as tuna in this case.	2.4479295826430048
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can, as rapidly as we can, to help cope with this catastrophe.	2.87597952602743
That is a fact of life.	6.597983227824475
By adopting these amendments, Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors.	1.837403486734819
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new; the Commission can approve these.	3.0023943700095574
In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.	3.1867803869949043
In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors.	3.107178973743036
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies, which have been particularly badly hit.	2.4907239313766474
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I do not have a background as a Member of the European Parliament, you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague Fernando Gomes.	4.014296870920194
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources. This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world.	2.574883886204898
On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously.	3.7048949944945377
What she has said here is completely justified.	1.7799822623819606
The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money.	1.9551840124416413
In this sense, there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology.	2.8430637364176445
In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights.	2.504755132020281
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect.	1.691105669344837
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources.	2.992971627237423
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	2.7027623171535904
If these amendments are adopted, I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues.	2.5738100646075357
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	3.5238037215770692
Hence, to my mind, that includes having the courage to amend Article 4 of the EC Treaty, which defines the Union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition. The same applies to Article 105, in my view, for the European Central Bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the Treaty, of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment.	2.6922618408737424
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	2.159686649890819
I should just like to make three comments which Commissioner Patten will perhaps see as similar but which, for various reasons, a Member can formulate more openly.	2.313672441870549
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack, either before trial or following judgement.	1.910085417181937
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support me in bringing home to the Commission the fact that what most Brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will.	2.6188196613282004
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue.	4.176456465862839
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business: a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy.	2.374472550360884
In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union.	2.7434055577513026
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal.	2.124810619740789
What we really need to focus on, however, is making the checks more effective.	3.0071842782402487
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more.	1.8357986240104005
In the meantime, let us support this first step.	3.2242836506035992
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe.	2.370892150101501
GMOs are the new challenge facing us.	1.9340475864544349
Underground networks?	447.4899709028953
In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives.	1.5221013684746325
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed.	3.178705851565478
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	4.12647251296127
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	2.9320096613539706
Well, patently, if we do open this debate today, Madam President, as you are requesting and as the Conference of Presidents is requesting, on the basis of Rule 50, we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments, enabling some other majority in this Parliament, at some future time, to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free, regular, peaceful and democratic elections within a Member State.	2.7988259318942603
However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about.	2.9310885888401548
Why are there no fire instructions?	1.4959242167674056
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	2.905027676393932
This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation. This will fundamentally weaken European environmental legislation and particularly this proposal.	2.5042699174634278
Subject: Farming and the Portuguese Presidency Will the Council outline the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares?	2.6897960700135326
Finally, just one more brief comment, Mr Byrne.	2.0424962554904544
The present CAP, however, is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis, granted that the 1992 CAP review and the GATT agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and impasses for the agricultural economy.	2.477140009599068
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question.	2.668501302601769
However, I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution.	6.008745049871947
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee.	4.324647755694621
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	3.1016735791777297
(DA) Mrs Cederschiöld' s report reflects an extremely peculiar form of logic. The EU introduces a common currency.	1.8735502171435716
Question Time (Council)	2.0788997051212883
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US, I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them.	2.9452012062583974
What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list?	2.341338459348756
I am using the phrase 'is said to be' on purpose, because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war.	1.9562222426964926
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	2.728037628018563
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that.	3.194338801010067
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004).	3.223799339208029
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development.	2.3810143930090444
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers.	3.6022623105725784
The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced.	2.3880245659885153
It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	2.8287342578058823
I would especially draw your attention to Amendment No 45, in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer, for new cars at any rate.	2.9459872654483785
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose.	2.243348953767064
Are we doing enough?	2.299462483113377
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions.	3.3515852499344794
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States?	2.8038600326264387
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	2.7157398780976796
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making.	5.733371218421189
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	3.5173181234174113
Mr President, what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today: an ideological instrument which helps to enslave peoples rather than free individuals?	3.1406162436993985
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community 'acquis' .	2.8226735243451424
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence.	1.7294762773531167
Then, by gearing actions to micro-projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and, finally, by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of Cuba, which all the ACP called for at Nassau and which has now made a formal application.	2.624864844366601
We cannot accept this.	3.441821949416956
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately.	4.135978914480527
I cannot accept that.	4.149432540545856
That is why, and I quote, this framework decision "is confined to supplementing the provisions of the International Convention of 20 April 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its Protocol" , i.e. the provisions of a timeworn international convention that is a good 71 years old.	3.407296699990733
We would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion, and frankly, we did not appreciate the discourtesy the Portuguese Presidency showed towards the European Parliament by scheduling the start of the Intergovernmental Conference for Saint Valentine' s day, the first day of the Strasbourg part-session.	2.9805093013190045
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet.	3.3589621322033936
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible, in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties.	2.771587918034878
Mr President, it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions!	4.866209343583486
If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you?	3.992117291007374
I feel, however, that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level.	3.1367244663203913
B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain);	1.9132529787868646
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105.	2.9812108234610877
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check.	2.35459670865639
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter.	1.873374915060974
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account.	6.32019195397154
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	3.091978611079235
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	3.4806007059529276
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory?	3.550145626375637
Our own staff policy is outdated.	1.4271680159907176
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.	2.700658076807365
I believe - and I shall only pick up on a few ideas - that Parliament alone, and no one else, can exert an influence over its Members. If this were not the case, the European Parliament' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years, and this institution would not move forward, as it should.	2.906837713319459
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning.	3.8066838518271537
As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another.	1.9989512096141215
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	3.1852718987536295
If, for any reason, the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else, if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude, they will be making a tragic mistake.	2.707130750328914
As the smallest Community initiative in existence, we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected.	2.228243797167541
Of course this is also the basic idea.	3.6984528212651835
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive.	2.061105690380088
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	2.9527555486678567
How will these people be selected?	1.4406291157931914
Some other points of agreement highlighted in Mrs McCarthy' s report, the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention, the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and, finally, the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes, on the basis of a real partnership.	2.760286788667746
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation.	3.092704842512289
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework.	2.690553682910599
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans.	1.6484371784987262
Tourism and employment	4372.887323222662
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies.	2.660704610475182
As for videoconferencing, more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded.	2.8234012379556797
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives.	2.824107196152739
The next item is the report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/68/EC as regards scrapie (COM(1998) 623 - C4-0026/1999 - 1998/0324(COD)).	1.8995937845774755
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race.	3.1647293605836757
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	2.1940192852484413
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial.	3.0997110995308286
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment.	3.8637265272585553
The next item is the report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS)).	1.8261473936180816
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.	2.812998321216254
In a fortnight' s time, I shall be in Berlin.	5.24580090967174
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders.	2.9606843178159297
No longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of, or for this fatalist approach towards, market forces as adopted by the liberals - and I am sorry that Mr Gasòliba I Böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin.	2.270586538622688
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office' s business abroad?	3.2309792595315807
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.	2.2525434469202392
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance.	3.7288010179425637
b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels	3.5796068231957063
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them.	2.4173800534125
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	3.284424664576328
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements.	1.9379074410762422
On the other hand, the Portuguese Presidency will continue, if and when the new WTO round begins within its term of office, which is by no means guaranteed, to ensure that the presence of Community production on international markets is strengthened. It will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported Community farm products and preserving the multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just referred.	2.7075815109393795
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again.	2.4048553536104778
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support.	2.165326961679262
Commissioner Fischler, of course, knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries, along with his lusty colleagues, because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland.	3.1034411226949326
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.	1.765124605731412
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	3.0033868952489495
Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model.	2.698448563755169
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force the Commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of Article 13 including, in particular, a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin.	3.377152670634003
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency.	3.014974398967472
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	1.8033230233052548
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects.	2.7742610733359934
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects.	2.3807539736353336
The spate of mergers, takeovers and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the matrix of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive.	3.930065426014893
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	3.3731340239455436
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	2.235255022661296
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious.	5.158935443504186
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services.	3.3958116679004156
Mr President, I listened with interest to the Commissioner's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market.	4.280393848199839
However, it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant Community legislation, for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or heeding the obligation to render an account of their use of Italian and European public finances.	2.733734266405223
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment. However, this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments.	3.035561611857836
So I refer to the things I do not agree with.	3.8441031438847593
One of the reasons for the Community' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market, which explains its attractiveness for women and young people, to whom it often offers their first experience of employment.	2.6650957468827863
It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean.	3.3922140157571516
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side.	2.832143871729504
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby.	2.568567253527113
They must, however, not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy, but must develop their own self-sufficient role.	4.059952063635997
In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions.	3.795606322597026
I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty.	2.3262067400160107
Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways.	2.6662296457490937
Did these firms need state aid to survive?	2.2047796846799117
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words, and I quote, "of the highest possible standard" are replaced by "are safe" .	3.049189717527779
But where will you place the emphasis?	1.6399785764020849
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today.	2.2112651025988135
The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	1.9443569333241584
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score.	1.5913477006251053
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case.	2.792257347905888
With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency.	3.436383274688995
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and, in the end, to promote the freedom of movement of these persons.	4.39747026807767
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community.	3.5139710397740465
I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties.	3.882913577554535
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness.	3.664567901499149
Today, a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking, and the current systems are, in the main, run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States.	3.3142982940264942
I come from a country which manufactures 50% of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable.	3.67477158976993
Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment.	3.0005705737118378
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	3.337373324619465
But who defines these tasks?	1.4014286700686212
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports.	2.6185702537837745
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way, Lisbon will turn out to be a success.	4.147115332883351
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go.	2.2568599970282923
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs.	2.3823270334746787
It is good that the procedure exists.	2.4696463849649817
In the meantime, it is nature that is taking the rap, as always.	4.57318591393842
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	1.8588115033250072
These days, the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable.	2.1163999472580586
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances.	2.9965420112451397
However, there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union.	2.890966992824157
Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	2.408483654022127
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	1.6466647911716938
Moreover, these are factors which create employment.	2.439204599334874
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council.	3.1474863498985037
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish.	3.238228374513668
However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project.	3.6146463630670613
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	4.924178974486203
However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you.	2.4602690669299028
On the other hand, we have voted in favour of Recital J which, in fact, is in line with what I, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, proposed to that Committee, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.1207079790366934
There is a great deal of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.	3.585625225891428
Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today.	3.1907461949093143
Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly.	3.3978305629690926
Uniformity needs to be worked on.	4.192528196356329
Secondly, it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology.	2.3931226353776314
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.	4.4521165419913435
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries, but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union.	3.1768914874261696
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there.	2.6099958518323905
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	2.476335922007315
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	3.533469355964311
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	2.0681221072236524
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect?	2.5198813126846566
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, LEADER I was an outright success due, in particular, to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators.	3.6166110533122584
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last.	2.6966267380627698
In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	3.1931677934142
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves.	1.6718892459748194
Mr President, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work.	2.8703015940038714
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote.	2.703686645994826
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	3.1921840930705323
In any case, the authoritative version is always, of course, the original language version.	3.203699907915466
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high.	3.4424700550685925
If there is, we have generated it in this House in the past year.	6.631025510526906
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter.	3.1895664522123774
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	2.359592334258638
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	2.649652447126226
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama.	1.944364894958909
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia, it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland.	2.6986027498494463
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries.	3.049498104242302
It will be voting against it.	6.636533129255356
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments.	4.531227450549596
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February.	2.853030894263424
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission.	3.608072390949658
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	2.3333920537796877
In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid.	2.5141883893385795
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda?	2.3248604559390253
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on.	4.695250340199181
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	3.2229165707320164
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM	2.4935167318116895
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission.	1.7465900465523188
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste.	2.264595321644009
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints.	4.022759650040558
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	2.0980076008292152
I accept that Mr Andersson's report is very well-intentioned, and I respect him for the work he has done, but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the EU.	2.7466631465091274
I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted.	2.9746846318176994
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens.	2.3489006561389343
I personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear Members of this Parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem, which is fair conditions, fair pay and fair hours.	2.8630292726280193
Subject: Working time directive Can the Commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive, for non-consultant hospital doctors, who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a Council amending directive (COM(98)0662-C4-0715/98 - 98/0318(SYN))?	2.4096598161280607
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved.	4.362370606491005
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads, and to repair them as quickly as possible.	2.803962395709413
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail.	2.364665701656495
Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation.	3.345375078950871
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council, as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state, in maintaining international peace and security.	3.2644832769389547
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading.	1.6636263700020328
In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too.	2.432661266045952
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat: whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium.	1.9351163944021283
For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion.	3.5180076239064113
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	3.1165698850134933
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others, which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start.	3.3998473555246744
We are waiting to see what the next move will be.	2.374073815857744
President.	77.3301660757284
.	77.3301660757284
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	3.2526108419965474
It will have to initiate these negotiations.	3.739729047238113
That is our role and this is the point of my question.	5.10838960891124
We are therefore all to blame.	3.5178524908856628
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road.	2.5624790079050346
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered.	2.3714497925573528
The Food Safety Authority's situation is quite different.	2.2846849387369392
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	4.170043192951404
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party, the delegation of the Spanish People' s Party, with regard to Mrs Terrón i Cusí' s resolution on the area of freedom, security and justice.	3.207937428231334
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe.	3.2923777623360433
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction.	3.7138256934542837
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities?	1.848435131513877
Legal security requires this.	1.3233450027739422
But the source is threatening to run dry.	1.6844384622116524
Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life.	2.6116163456819663
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities.	2.2510769906680013
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss.	1.8034913033554614
Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament.	2.8067163735135767
This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal:	5.036125785506099
We want instruments to prevent abuse.	1.5492312660600969
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed.	3.2876825302475265
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission.	3.2418575170252444
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	4.0993417794038365
However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1).	2.609153808392569
Yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong European institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole. In this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society, all of which are described, with no form of hierarchy, as 'integral elements of European governance' .	2.3802157365637213
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers.	2.1297124119573185
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.	1.9229025583091852
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission, Parliament and Council.	2.79504678677586
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member, since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission.	3.060811684896146
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.692565634831119
The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office.	2.9816834709653177
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union.	2.63235902068623
However, for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance, freedom of movement is still highly restricted.	2.2851347525142724
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand.	2.6777992591658455
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region.	1.9305535674479386
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month.	3.6242659642989974
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets.	3.2806702560488645
The Council?	447.4899709028953
This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money.	2.8892363259871976
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting.	1.8456361856650974
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report.	2.5730600982779386
In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question.	3.916125031521708
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials.	3.510661900238904
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action.	2.63550581459541
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it.	4.33853180209153
This is wrong!	1.850307517523997
In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff.	2.397518189815159
Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter.	4.186839621260759
I therefore took a European Commissioner, and not just the French ones, or ambassadors posted in Paris or MEPs to engage in this dialogue each week. This made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected, listened to and informed.	2.176288625825767
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority.	2.2290060244926426
Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency.	2.446585815790546
Mr President, it is our opinion that one facet of the construction of Europe hinges on the construction of a common judicial system, for the Europe that we want to build, which comprises administrative law, civil law, both substantive and procedural, and criminal law, both substantive and procedural.	2.9827892455400513
This applies to every country.	2.5818049512951267
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist.	2.6856256692861584
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	2.356983691529469
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies.	2.7756975333879423
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13, namely the fight against discrimination based on race, gender, age, and special needs.	2.53546115706521
Finally, even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies, there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected, and that is not the intention.	3.560746573049207
It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	2.2556610870651297
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced.	2.6593673843618446
Mr President, we shall vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group resolution because it denounces Total-Fina' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and I endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of superannuated vessels should be prohibited, or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers.	2.655776038821231
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted.	3.2370204958334354
The problem is that, when we look at FYROM, we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries, such as Kosovo and Albania, or to cooperate politically with, for instance, Yugoslavia.	3.0083675237440284
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	2.0854694869059665
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	2.8594662493333804
Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation.	3.918290827873206
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	2.7550211453061437
We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument.	3.2918224495694006
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions.	3.9441304616069095
As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods.	2.906788031292536
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	1.9779786975772429
In my view, as far as China is concerned, and knowing that the European Union' s policy towards China has been a total failure, allegedly constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or, worse, it has given the Chinese new pretexts for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms (as Mrs Wallström has said with regard to the Internet) in all sectors, in Tibet, in inland Mongolia, in eastern Turkistan.	2.569279043838732
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	2.38593040058171
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates.	2.040955935382161
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.	1.6851734763796364
Madam President, may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry.	2.819637053094696
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	2.9366769890978004
I think this proposal is a good one.	5.048132621167781
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.	2.189140740760132
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you, as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries, will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board.	2.7723216341227372
Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment.	3.655357354946785
Like yourself, he promised "less and better" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered "much more and much worse" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise.	2.7660137678165366
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe.	3.0744235760981664
I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP.	2.584290707167478
For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.	2.356011775909955
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies.	2.6846302404308693
Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation.	4.1957975854962575
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July.	2.9246669696146284
The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law.	2.4173745128158144
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the "what is to be done" variety.	4.603533202456416
But, listening to you, Commissioner, we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in 1992, I believe, the Commission and Parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee.	3.0712976592540664
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.	2.883613441904105
I am a European and even a federalist.	2.844412773273447
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	5.000033300384582
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	2.2325039749250544
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	2.3965077274277
We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future.	3.3998815328970364
Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another.	2.091521661068936
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	2.7397022374215116
Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible.	4.033749258538328
The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements.	3.1014413420608142
This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well.	2.896495691188056
Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.	3.219349107874838
The damage to your country, Mr President, and to mine, Spain, could be horrendous.	4.2992214130607955
We know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which stem above all from the Treaty of Amsterdam, which has reinforced its political dimension. This inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development.	2.9729247839806114
This is also an important point.	7.098546253042045
Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views.	3.993059600795121
Why do I think we need the directive so much?	3.623205669571494
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	3.3766262748431197
With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period.	3.369684575254754
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	2.276033307484607
The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States.	3.8633895069664477
There are, I believe, around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment.	3.011790199971038
After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail.	3.7106150821081094
Commissioner, there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so-called 'ecological hull' in which case, in the event of an accident, the seawater penetrates the containers and, as a result of pressure, the oil is transferred to other tanks.	3.311505972413254
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	3.29675039609176
In order to generate extra means if necessary, I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors.	3.6768287163740707
The first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of pariahs, the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment, the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion.	2.830204714921775
The second subject is flexibility and simplification.	1.5939084272077837
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention.	2.6645144340008833
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	2.4668143045790845
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe?	4.251487200412924
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point.	4.664848493697263
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either.	2.8359770550423824
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either.	2.306380277580266
The Commission' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie.	2.141495342424086
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	3.035564862223327
Today, nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems, with Internet at the sharp end, mobile telephones and digital television, are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models.	2.050769521415401
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process.	3.4739039885093788
Enlargement appears to be an end in itself, but unless decisions are made on a social policy, a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the Union, the Europe bequeathed to us at the end of Mr Prodi' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation, rather than the community of destiny which we hope for.	2.9947614123112665
However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against.	3.2511278048997805
Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important.	3.7229653690709803
Action simply has not been taken.	3.6149032330222033
This event must underpin enlargement.	1.2873792553322034
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues.	2.009242623143268
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote: "Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts".	2.5252231195224444
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution, to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group.	3.9445003979253563
I hope that this building will then be occupied.	4.008534404343029
But for my part, I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts.	2.8618585707758837
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union.	2.698249087299515
We also intend to initiate a new debate, a more innovative one, on the issue of Europe' s film heritage, given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a European cultural identity and of a European audiovisual economy.	3.434477921130698
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer.	3.6341974683033347
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	2.3324435490996405
Then the content: the Council draft fudges the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems, varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain Member States of the Union.	1.8310583775507907
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	3.447165415885398
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	2.7802362512597627
That is absolutely absurd.	1.9941570334497976
- (EL) The Freedom Party' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union' s political future.	2.9383278626025056
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.	3.679235330140462
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	2.3710709871485727
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes?	2.474613087549145
Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place.	3.940590573843658
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today.	4.212688473063448
Mr President, firstly my thanks and appreciation to Commissioner Patten for his comments here today, particularly in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of "banker" for the entire operation.	3.809215472292577
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.778910951802909
Today, thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants, he is in Portugal.	2.5127429464897983
It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds.	4.134708220454797
Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month.	2.3040379147146974
It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust.	3.8026949074930956
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative.	2.391024712214971
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité.	2.279575154562205
. (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union.	2.632264081165566
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	1.626905098943158
But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel.	3.125812546071788
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention.	2.997279837810639
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here.	3.6348090827507433
For that purpose, I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission. This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods.	2.666020158201379
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.	4.975524779500591
, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.6918852835802336
However, turning to the substance, I should like to ask the Commissioner to bear in mind the following: that for all national and regional programmes, Greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the European Union - via its central administration, its central government.	2.673456557895827
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight.	2.7563422995253974
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament.	2.714088048359544
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	3.0031218672802136
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	3.74135204038572
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis.	2.1016479043219727
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities.	3.275550134138628
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself?	2.613608661794834
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means.	2.252384031812824
The European information centres, which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency, should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting.	2.2648907212012386
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Where necessary, workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment.	1.9580172084158791
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.	3.1253541134938607
I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85.	3.2508555474801084
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	3.0361892357417704
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray.	2.224090094158871
First, I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.	3.537659539189674
I know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties, but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the Danube and what happened in Doñana.	3.247415878732475
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments, involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria.	2.0286213665102113
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable?	2.3229275007143264
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	4.135417169052692
Given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many commentators that we will see an increased incidence of conflict, of so-called "water wars", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's view about the potential destabilisation, both in Turkey and in the wider region, that will be caused by this dam?	3.2540036608248073
Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances.	2.781012012497293
I also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in, as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 November last year and then on 26 January. I further regret the fact that neither the regions, nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme.	2.7081862582353686
Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria.	3.9589147927123784
It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	2.8903905941277483
Subject: High infant mortality in Kosovo According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm.	1.933214276013846
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised.	3.0885859142417162
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again?	2.7383184316387927
Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific.	3.1986873440695356
Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence.	2.785017482870937
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another.	2.3112901821782197
We have taken good note of your intentions.	3.4804275641630937
There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens.	7.033600900823551
Fifthly, the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear.	2.2821234949463873
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	3.002838727946458
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	3.4205824695610834
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	2.2245263550758687
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable.	3.4119857648851672
It is quite logical, it is consistent!	5.901867666980429
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique.	3.3984771860665903
It has been a useful debate.	6.582137685743991
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	3.8808808341412493
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow.	2.1451633419159255
Most companies hate competition.	1.6604911443204613
How are we going to assess the results of these five years?	3.153812839389321
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment.	2.049171626687769
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them.	2.388877145734329
That does not apply to Austria alone.	3.6353026977415026
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result.	3.1579309553425263
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	2.2187745084895343
When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States.	2.3834977542915263
I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide.	3.2951724679601235
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility.	3.7693009416609304
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility.	2.69809675800631
The Austrian elections were held in a free, proper and democratic manner.	1.990608067549044
Furthermore, and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence, we demand respect for biodiversity, for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature; but at the same time, and this was apparent during recent negotiations, we force ACP countries to sign TRIPS agreements.	2.360847337732155
We must resolve this issue, because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat.	3.282371171594037
When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks.	2.4804987937390592
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	3.4446799176395233
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	3.1501795883263775
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	2.444692536739839
It plays down one of the Treaties' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the European institutions' policies and measures. It seems to ignore the fact that various European regions are still considerably less advanced than others.	3.0697019799360503
Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too.	2.9783799765873415
Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals.	2.574757961059414
The same applies to European air traffic control.	1.9224109718690916
Secondly, I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner' s proposal to create a European civil protection body.	3.9044884448364674
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country, Israel, does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility.	2.8396729966339973
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	3.250076469419269
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure.	2.920504916321757
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	3.00845121638493
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	2.2916514241417363
In this respect too, I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies, specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted.	3.8435943069420193
These failings will result in particular in the late implementation of INTERREG III and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid.	2.3230017024458554
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation.	2.1733663900826867
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.	3.5325105747812313
To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively.	3.681097431953285
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.	4.0153110271558194
Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report.	3.799701698965352
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way.	2.68925852237096
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	4.260778699688056
Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	3.1207719150081883
We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points.	2.92288929669274
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS.	2.76770019399145
I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	2.726048157223886
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image, and this is a fact, not a judgement.	2.7573318035480763
The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased.	4.658289021091813
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	3.5332839546845567
You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit.	2.407987468433259
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	2.936718181306757
The INTERREG initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas, islands and both mountain and non-mountain areas, such as the prefecture of Arta in Greece, whose omission from Annex I of the Commission' s communication is ill-considered.	2.608635351073151
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings.	2.309162059239091
No, equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life.	2.2754541925982696
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished.	2.5533907508867184
What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this.	3.180829587933904
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal?	2.3993031972023875
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up.	2.9584480616602593
Given this context, I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago.	2.8180751253978804
For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence.	3.4438413278857922
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	3.118973710310879
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be.	4.916803557884811
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents.	3.130853446042727
We should salute it - and I think we do.	3.6025809194344243
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	3.8243949735709273
The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	2.277971865153782
Here too there is at least some progress.	1.9664204041804458
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean?	2.6689677315240905
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU' s overall agricultural policy.	2.752766484935622
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks.	2.5387304035381955
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic.	3.815525182181921
Now that the Commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity, this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid: one that is inessential but demanding in terms of resources.	3.6535258231783567
But tomorrow will be too late.	1.7638344067623897
As a result, we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997, too.	3.1614485061724715
The hurricane of the same name swept across Europe claiming numerous victims, mainly in France and Germany, but also in Switzerland, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.	2.2814399467940367
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances.	1.9291866802309574
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things.	4.1806484592956386
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	1.8731067460380602
I would point out that there is no European legal system, but that a different legal system exists in each Member State.	3.367059418373483
Result: a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself.	2.37774616217264
Secondly, this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too.	2.340363342730604
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind.	3.040985642799222
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future.	3.3182231688243964
But that is not to say that we are satisfied, and that everything in the garden is rosy.	4.6012124646751165
In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period.	2.53245234209335
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts.	1.7148704950829778
As regards the precautionary principle, I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon.	4.242795314178851
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.	3.168313391021109
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts.	2.6288913368255216
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation.	1.5173928977810445
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	2.220568573198045
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	2.516594858530752
For instance, the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered.	2.4446477620547395
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party.	3.414663984806097
Commissioner, this morning President Prodi, among others, stressed that the Balkans are testing our ability to act effectively, the very credibility of the European Union is on trial, and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed.	3.042462542510792
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda.	2.35031588571743
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	3.4831623337328685
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts.	2.3824724770242613
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious.	3.023242174522669
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector.	2.338197624663104
Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies.	3.7092356200009133
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	2.393513699083961
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.	2.00019486919496
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	3.9332529275780774
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living.	2.234225825866622
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	3.2566191408672465
There are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been relocated to the so-called New Lands.	3.739037600604974
You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States.	3.007006694181932
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	2.3437547570694677
Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid.	3.7392049873637205
It is certainly not my task to judge other people' s alliances but if the People' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance, let them at least propose something positive, something that has a chance of working, not repeat the same tired old platitudes, ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past, nor oppose other people' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them.	2.2791771188234087
The environment is in a parlous state.	5.810122908293369
Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas.	2.5662955373437395
Of course, it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport, services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement.	3.2638447666801538
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	2.647707712435297
However, an exception should certainly be made in the case of Shell and BP, for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate, rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability.	2.3905600926829838
A list has been compiled, containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment.	1.6446366377588169
Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved.	2.1385036177403367
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	4.110461100377749
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health.	2.7943358793254154
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers.	2.4095867878434705
I think we should take a more positive approach here.	3.406617429816129
BSE has certainly not gone away.	1.8054613121336867
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	2.53270629482762
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about.	2.800363942874689
Amendments Nos 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions.	2.0005882038324585
Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed.	2.8352703430246344
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves, in the medium term, to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus.	2.332746110242209
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April.	4.47239972526024
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction.	2.2150863785802883
On south-eastern Europe, I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements.	2.4882262628240084
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.	3.150203917331784
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.	2.6706978700061614
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State.	3.5998895301879092
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	4.082411326825694
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	3.741298993183792
It indicates, however, that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction.	3.5451997574294696
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied.	3.123249131210269
We are not going to enter into a debate now.	4.234450608349509
As I said earlier, there are always problems interpreting the directives of the European Commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another.	3.0244296322337205
It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed.	3.6794897059266494
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.	2.7975211506524964
There are reputable companies too.	1.3517617036030851
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution.	1.5862518727133794
It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned.	3.5769048848816944
Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%?	2.8300376663258957
You still have not finished that agenda.	1.894981098686189
I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society.	3.0568504945491455
Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system.	2.711354172050341
It is a 'Trojan horse' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War.	3.4956008807385626
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	2.5005414845975804
So we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the Amoco Cadiz; a wreck on the North coast, a wreck on the South coast, a wreck on the West coast.	2.269750146354233
Mr President, I too believe that tourism has a very important role to play, not just in our European regions, but throughout the world, because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development.	4.212773651846613
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter.	2.6367497466206093
Let me explain: it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities.	2.2599994252667464
The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it.	1.4029107249637256
In other words, it is positive discrimination.	7.166440482188628
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster, because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today, we have the hell of Milosevic, followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces.	2.922963835333415
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss.	2.6256457335816785
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.	3.223483585200385
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	3.0273416514218114
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle.	4.101299429923893
For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas.	2.98170309651394
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	1.827111063762627
We must meet these challenges together.	1.6027357781274305
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	2.0230126421378283
This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government.	2.348881914029106
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.	2.700878483512066
(FR) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency.	2.8369691568207274
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	3.2613477914194666
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services.	2.2511468962988346
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision.	3.594839142633822
We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments.	2.5124359566785697
I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world.	3.132175847191786
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal.	3.5959168384020956
We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.	2.6314025506256016
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	1.603567681569681
Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy.	2.8375944443495587
In terms of comitology, Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part, insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned.	3.2738777254359444
Second Part	72.17482167067989
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms.	1.5277843275818963
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	3.1615789147139988
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which, following the agreement, the European Parliament' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it.	3.1299717900045176
We think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy, and the EAGGF, of course, has a crucial role to play in this.	3.8180623659457096
All this is important.	10.537802860897218
In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union.	3.1200072299236696
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	2.371178290480148
(Parliament gave its assent) President.	1.796645521183409
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question.	2.456029438343247
From that point of view, neither local governments and much less non-governmental organisations, for example the farming cooperatives which would be interested in further development of the farming sector, have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third Community Support Framework, nor have they had any involvement in the previous CSFs.	2.5782961674112763
The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension.	1.785140778519888
.	77.3301660757284
Africa is, for us, a worrying topic for discussion. We therefore have another duty at international level, which has already been proposed by the Commissioner responsible for trade: the undertaking to relaunch the Millennium Round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries, not just in terms of writing off debts, but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world, with a great deal of willingness on our part, which we had already proposed prior to Seattle but which we could not put into practice.	3.1555463788683125
I am also saying this as a former environment minister.	3.2481010398926173
Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.	4.162677568934903
Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution.	2.169385716550965
As is known, the Commission should already, before the end of 1998, have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67, guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service, securing its economic viability, and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved, including postal workers and customers.	2.7359351470696534
I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change.	2.4170364252224417
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning.	3.388587815212022
One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny.	3.7795394820892882
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits.	2.0370338485285253
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution.	4.950177850437832
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability.	1.8528860654813302
This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government.	2.509275920257682
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	2.6055903304381056
It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis.	2.983791857970006
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.	1.892192069100422
I am persuaded, however, by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability.	2.8750814607341058
One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners.	3.5159774309766725
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection.	1.9964414923870444
Mr President, Commissioner, does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy?	2.8006956054187455
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State.	3.01600194466038
The compatibility with the various national systems of law, as confirmed by experts, shows that criminal law is another area where Europe has a great deal in common, for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned.	2.8978719530411334
Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre.	2.55743049650168
I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins.	3.922260203068616
Excesses are no longer the exception, they have unfortunately become the rule.	2.566169029900879
Therefore, independence is prerequisite for effective checks.	1.4526343709291585
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed.	2.8873302373851706
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	3.1603906019068697
Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax?	2.629160001007247
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?	2.8910814784971315
Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled.	2.019338095613564
Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery.	3.2939108716087744
And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation.	2.8261521761417323
We must not kill the goose that lays the golden egg of tourism.	2.52373077348356
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	2.918820883360374
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002.	2.8072140362227764
Let us remember what is at stake here.	2.4762361779708537
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	2.310325686893125
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex.	3.034691683111228
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	1.5954482493630877
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking, and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech, which is available in four languages.	3.478168121961842
Certain amendments concern improvements to the Commission' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the Council has removed.	2.783015303268397
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	2.596791985935162
Mr Prodi reverts to the contested concept of 'governance' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the IMF, whose ideological agenda is predicated solely on liberalism and monetarism.	1.7580603667909673
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council.	2.4300008910788726
Gentlemen, obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes.	2.381918334246535
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this.	5.0106430396893336
The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers?	2.906774194472454
As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective.	3.36171980418177
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect.	1.6085904404875306
We could, in no way, agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package.	3.384722166778824
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers.	2.6651278919445063
This is why it is so hard to strike a balance, not only between the different countries or the different components, but especially between the different groups listed in the programme, and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date.	3.3690927705115414
Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision.	2.2496603865505724
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	4.911547818565869
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to.	1.615648685273174
This report, therefore, appears at a crucial time, on the eve of Mr Kinnock' s reforms.	3.231149177796501
You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee.	2.8798811112436473
Having made these general observations, I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG.	2.7336224124274673
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	3.171096775135405
It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is.	3.8901141933641994
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000, having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate.	2.2586369962305857
This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu.	3.9844130304075183
Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid.	3.912410267311204
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board.	3.1844372625025343
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	3.7014716861883605
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good?	2.6064900808544036
I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	3.648326715104603
- (FR) The Commission' s White Paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (now 81 and 82) certainly does not propose any "renationalisation" of competition policy, as some Members of the European Parliament fear.	3.082328626327738
The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing.	2.34762659302679
Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union.	2.6842976810479184
Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned.	3.3307318664045917
Mr President, I welcome much, indeed most, of what has been said in this debate.	3.4718164416489117
Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament.	4.580998555457779
When we have the chance to ask direct questions, the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked.	2.5688481281936473
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy.	2.054370000501239
As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision.	5.842506364254641
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense.	3.4231429225246672
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	3.6917525344738893
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision.	2.6789397915877107
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets.	2.6333087517832903
Our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning, action to prevent juvenile delinquency, the reintegration of offenders, and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved, for example the police, the courts and social services.	2.1218014116642263
During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures.	2.194315056659732
The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions.	2.464625191972693
Therefore, if the regulation is adopted, the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000, the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year, will be made using the new system.	2.903472802295012
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	2.6314484892322074
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	3.322421843105354
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.	2.2300392161896054
It does, however, support my view that I am not, apparently, the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion.	3.9345155819459663
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term, because they are very important subjects in themselves.	3.4241065227202685
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities.	2.518837144864729
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine.	2.286585145961933
As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets.	1.5383173904816996
They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens.	2.9651205335216533
There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved.	3.1458519960492377
As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.	2.9323375787606425
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability.	3.714991799062127
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems.	2.709086912858917
The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission.	4.006649982973397
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures.	4.566229803122704
It could have sunk anywhere.	1.8220651280237097
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	3.8559918147468033
The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.	2.6761368765290903
I can only fully share your concern.	2.5365348468871636
Question No 5 by (H-0785/99):	1.2605856117352525
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds.	2.9307243886764462
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second.	3.2711790890439403
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?	3.730719128599153
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important "Amsterdam leftovers" .	3.5758628186853936
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.	3.4397666059264713
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent.	2.1086038960916658
However, there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved.	3.8672996038344083
We must be very vigilant.	7.144350910279325
I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep.	3.2500726410438414
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	2.140083813859714
That is a sensible forecast to make, it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain.	4.578254644141764
It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly.	2.317988734931574
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not.	2.3844582086707184
Mr President, 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council.	3.5663835850252656
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen.	2.415281627078496
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised.	2.7370040766844026
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive.	2.579263077219458
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	2.4346700235284526
Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence.	2.510482404515212
Mr President, Commissioner, Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy.	2.249642126291156
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty.	1.9805470685922795
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions.	2.8045660511925923
Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations?	2.535199331796909
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of.	2.898648558333418
At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified.	3.212070979066573
From that perspective, what I am saying here is of deep relevance.	2.2161293373596016
Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it.	3.3433161194718535
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action.	2.905982381853282
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.	2.8574436760692095
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world.	2.1990592327663303
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is.	2.6404311586770923
Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold.	2.2835649472903152
. (EL) On reading the Commission' s statement on social protection, which is animated by so many good intentions, one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality.	3.4619774625118906
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.	3.159458724068293
We are recovering from a crisis. However, I believe that, in the future, it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next Commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme.	3.9632479602735344
Hitherto, such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically, and was of no use to our services; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself.	2.4516124113708866
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	2.8066750916838727
The day before yesterday I was pleased to hear an interview given by the KFOR commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in Kosovo were starting to be, particularly as regards security, crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level.	2.0774866737969773
But in Belgium too, there are a great number of people, older people for example, who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman.	3.5978617357295777
In this area we must respond to public opinion.	3.3299333402939615
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently.	2.568866650302123
It is a fact: China is the major threat, the major threat to us, the threat which we must confront, the threat to peace.	3.233871865245032
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance.	2.6466738922177786
In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2.	2.26286880533824
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside.	3.1477226809170373
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties?	2.097299682042615
The Commission sympathises with these considerations.	2.7159515391777584
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	2.834840715363317
This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking.	3.472657694638079
In my own country, more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds.	2.8895985035099714
The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed.	3.051583591564123
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	1.9463852023602046
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services.	2.457695831075396
Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that.	3.044930418927028
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	2.815017873920483
These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty.	3.566373311955351
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	4.203684126727899
My conclusion regarding INTERREG, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this. They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union.	2.691716325821875
Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility.	5.060151293145614
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments.	2.2606330789379494
Mr President, there are three points I wish to address.	6.982942129164607
These are sound, first steps which illustrate that, if this Parliament so wishes, changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly.	2.338329352384018
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters.	2.0822681856445286
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons.	4.04357499103843
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	4.007979079172099
We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees.	2.4087235518804406
But I really feel that, in the circumstances, we want to know what the implications would be for business.	3.8117312885184975
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament' s position on the case all the more appropriate, as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence.	2.185036227444886
Much of this data is confidential, as has also been mentioned, which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises.	2.8989737514721363
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: "The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft" .	1.7718459221086522
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April.	2.5586991573572395
To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection.	2.699887227012075
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done.	3.0118473229747065
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment.	2.5149259037967475
We will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case.	4.221173597784162
In this, their second report, the experts tell us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that the ERDF and the Social Fund represent two-thirds of the Structural Funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the Structural Funds come to the same thing. They tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the EAGGF-Guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the Commission and to the Member States.	3.2629084025537094
A5-0012/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established in the Community (COM(1999)3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013(CNS)).	2.148306835986578
At the Santa Maria da Feira European Council meeting in June, the Portuguese Presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the Commission presented in its White Paper a few days ago.	2.9967939949799396
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	3.1954809291920565
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence.	2.7218639724769553
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding.	2.8897743390773885
We have to get this right.	5.030149734037638
But what then instead?	1.3303568438244793
Thank you, Mr Murphy.	6.609368735472913
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream.	2.353451769596331
As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State.	3.040805225341176
Firstly: a regulatory framework is needed, which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens.	2.1996384246591694
We want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future.	4.242054139978002
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these?	2.4140433776208585
Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered.	3.7324213399086825
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed.	2.996543065905326
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.	2.595409240436467
It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves.	3.161780612998421
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time.	4.4421757165410645
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	2.920543113663843
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe.	3.101078356226108
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget.	3.1152244218183487
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group, Mr Poettering, in his opening address.	2.6070166210409798
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	2.7766370122132735
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the 'polluter pays' principle.	2.155027400046527
And thirdly, if we are to have a transparent consumer policy, we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs.	4.285927360077334
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	2.608385303883872
If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions.	2.7062007303906133
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings.	3.6232475842659086
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union.	2.317940113299337
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?	2.5939412858389668
However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999.	2.818904289692408
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income, with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies.	1.8671829414057615
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions.	1.5806623497711632
I do, however, think it appropriate to say that, at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement, the European side must point out to the Skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will, so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in New York.	3.5353782938640923
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields.	2.8864112266760173
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public.	3.994105911690895
We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it.	1.8657334103587964
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	3.2387826443217818
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy.	2.610539235206635
This is an economic community, of course, but it is also, primarily, a community of values.	4.4460247041819905
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	2.5994790309176747
The challenge of enlargement is political.	3.334263079918141
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	1.726641908310614
Never mind that the Commission' s requirement to produce an annual report, set out clearly in the Council resolution, has produced only one "non-paper" , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is climbing uphill and the cart of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards.	2.587076754842172
In expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, as Amendment No 38 stipulates, even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer, Parliament would, for the first time, not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of Europe, it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies.	2.798723322989081
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	3.413011452591089
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	4.155313907853348
It is only natural that we in Parliament guard the interests of our citizens, but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable, international environment, in which the goal of human safety is pursued.	3.748041556616085
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life.	2.8261754364398746
That has only happened recently.	1.5597435433161257
The market is a law unto itself.	2.172191706192271
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement.	3.327838141141893
Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together.	4.481873605004439
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	1.3460683689795439
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests.	3.3744032176210186
The development partnerships within the thematic fields, which are referred to in Amendment No. 22, would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative.	2.7070397890562283
Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible.	4.294424239122324
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	2.6328840320451126
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.	4.676570481064209
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA, and therefore in other parts of the world, and of a sudden rise in inflation.	3.3228392757882443
Like Mr Miller, I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or, if at all possible, within the next couple of days.	3.0576287969211733
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs.	2.026609641056889
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings.	1.730513175832126
The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough.	3.386640102297951
Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said.	3.3907553840413684
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement, but with a view to joining in future.	3.0274907841678473
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia?	1.603226574764766
What is the role of the scientific committees?	5.74607830987704
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then, of course, she is young and full of energy.	3.024764690620153
We are therefore right to demand improved controls, sanctions and preventive measures.	2.2449397651114738
I should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter-state cooperation zones has taken no account of the Mediterranean' s geographical peculiarities, which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions.	3.423587545949673
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more.	2.1833188466899633
I would therefore ask you, Commissioner, to help me in my task as a new Member.	3.575824917218682
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles.	3.4591412267593302
I must add, however, that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States.	2.4005858620663147
For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	3.8792848375587177
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction.	2.3135002687122013
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez.	2.1279095465606135
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects.	2.928922925500953
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate.	3.0274693689515373
After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia.	2.682996817345737
As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept.	2.319883762639827
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks.	3.365446000116474
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject.	4.273947520504971
In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are.	3.7471768933706184
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published.	2.100422504729081
I come from a rural area.	2.7590623745851652
It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions.	3.5296390755818874
In conclusion, Mr President, Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy: we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers, not go into reverse.	2.813554829007113
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	4.059504055829424
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast, effective work of the conference, prior to enlargement.	3.400878612635587
In terms of the IGC issue, I have a specific question for you. I believe that the Court of Justice in Luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and OLAF.	3.6876036721815453
Mr President, may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on his report.	3.2018178382139926
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society.	3.31533113453805
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform.	3.21198177711457
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled? If we are, then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved.	3.3416868965677886
On behalf of the TDI Group, I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro' s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe.	2.8822161753846194
I agree that Article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about, but that is how the Treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination, discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place.	2.315958976424923
Similarly, during the WTO negotiations, at a time when, to quote the second paragraph of the Schwaiger report, "the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries, especially the poor" , the European Union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring ACP countries, albeit with a transitional period of several years, instead of strengthening it, especially for the poorest countries.	3.1172402170191584
I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards.	1.4882064869504301
And in a democracy, Parliament should be able to challenge the content.	4.216273514788002
If you are, when exactly are you going to do it?	3.6789572723686637
A fair and, indeed, generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East.	2.584682260739877
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	2.4442033450260823
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked.	3.529274636519596
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come.	2.5480894584597875
They even reject the strict minimum, i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels.	2.487332089612528
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds.	3.1372174740076386
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing.	2.915269464036149
In particular, there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty.	3.612803683165996
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report.	3.376729961966812
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country.	2.2931405042765
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.	3.9078482213803607
These cultural dimensions, however, almost always have their own economic dimension in turn, that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives.	3.224760208507527
Mr President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.	4.6454593212075865
In this respect I must say that, in terms of your commitment to a political union, to which we are favourable, this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model, on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world.	3.346931801611934
An initial joint PHARE/CIP committee is to meet in February to assess this coordination, and let me confirm my attentiveness and availability with regard to this, together with my colleagues and fellow Commissioners Verheugen, Patten and Poul Nielson.	2.375228615433075
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	3.1407586713180278
If we simply import raw materials from these developing countries, rather than allowing them the add-on value of producing their finished articles in their own country, we deny them the very poverty-eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations.	2.4267835039740473
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.	3.175999643366437
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance	1.714986248367458
This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond.	2.290171788409507
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	2.3118284496226664
It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself.	3.0570724177046373
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted.	3.3795963652473664
Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public.	3.9080700451991164
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative.	2.6363723284583966
The polluter should pay.	2.3610928176256953
Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament.	2.9640061253130545
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period. This is not very good at all.	2.829849022054309
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	4.460814985814885
In saying all of this, I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems.	3.6239046573726355
The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza.	2.1034456443564973
What are the scenarios for development and the potential risks?	3.84218332060172
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently.	4.1368710971602285
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives.	3.4460740240084364
My third criticism stems from the first two. The weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations, a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus.	2.2602589582403576
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	3.51906179219407
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements.	3.547180944366965
The main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings, for example units in funds, standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments.	2.3601712745177577
Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive.	3.334389087727015
This was, after all, one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission.	3.3539146383138605
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it.	4.2263067995600325
How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes?	3.2297068578775963
Mr President, permit me to say quite publicly to Mrs Stenzel, who is a member of the ÖVP executive, that many MEPs are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with Haider, and that we wish to denounce you for doing so!	3.1494597185519364
It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned.	3.612979856284574
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war.	2.116790802466454
A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible.	3.187419055038723
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement.	1.7512895323936497
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive.	2.3473097266024077
However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men.	2.3309014258838148
We support these critical remarks, and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd, against this background, to vote in favour of approving the accounts.	2.8888811401425945
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel/Syria question might be promising.	2.129190410646423
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils.	3.0153905981732834
Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this.	2.5362344700904136
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
To give you an example, in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions, the equivalents of the English words: "in so far as" have been omitted.	2.484388201364811
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	1.9736408853940683
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell.	2.0314748572070402
On the other hand, we can go a long way using the existing tools.	3.3772498113386082
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	2.970105652039291
As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.	3.6768786633771127
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far, while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal.	4.114807057187991
In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag.	2.9275465293531164
Similarly, the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the European Central Bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding.	2.5711538750765013
Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.673812512667692
I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided.	2.8375959868771807
Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified.	2.561838426048301
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	3.4903430119092707
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports.	2.2633433434774037
We warn that this coalition, if it is formed today, unacceptably legitimises the extreme right, directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation, which bring us together in this European Union.	2.4241678551186854
The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy.	4.6665914454306945
And yet, we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid.	2.1800660122887083
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.	2.8417507921965464
Mr President, it is very likely that, during this century, good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil.	3.5246755829506102
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution.	2.4038969466109723
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	2.5585925244359693
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can, in a few hours, cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country, plunging its whole population into recession.	2.726451161277809
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	2.5540079280400048
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks.	2.872912152115596
Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future.	2.69119538416365
Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.	3.2241790593340975
So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty.	3.502167278831827
In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures.	3.4966319450187946
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	3.211670152981438
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close.	3.0318206305938733
Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time.	2.6041533715695415
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed.	2.3239138313024257
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems: high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment, poverty and social exclusion.	1.7311097700666922
Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.	2.602342716960882
We have already heard about the various aspects involved.	2.8637740159870515
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	1.7707718422290357
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees.	2.787796731094048
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system.	2.483685074728751
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO.	3.721725904626403
I believe that it is important to point out one thing: expenditure effected under LEADER+ is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running.	3.0109959456454516
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope.	2.332233672042774
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244.	2.661487621006666
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms.	3.162275067596235
Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition.	2.2673707542840935
The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage.	3.353324010657671
Secondly, because it can promote recycling, which is important.	4.703267474427522
As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December.	3.1412833698309184
Need I remind you that the European Parliament itself took the initiative on 1 February? I must again thank Mr Napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are, of course, the representatives of the people in each Member State.	3.1528049270130163
Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China.	3.8861996711395537
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	2.30373889650984
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible.	2.7074997634659335
The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	3.4717352627894025
In view of the seriousness of such situations, we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field.	2.7808922155166496
Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?	2.531883625562027
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	2.5112534879738067
First: we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways.	1.9030315805002795
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union.	2.7509159670327326
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	2.865100164968143
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up.	2.570977980570308
Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse.	1.8779615712997264
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	1.3873778473934828
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities.	3.2395702868763636
After the planned accession of new Member States with their 100 million inhabitants, the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current EU Member States, this squandering will generate even more protest.	2.7909224298629383
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market.	2.652622526547206
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing.	2.0644495275947468
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors.	2.6800729594706225
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	2.1756743049858986
In any event, for those Members who not aware of the President' s position, I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today' s Minutes:	2.9333033887609026
Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me.	2.3927327252426616
Madam President, as my dear friend Elly will know, I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy.	3.177783215019297
Resumption of the session	1.7491832698293113
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended.	4.807082708321092
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set.	2.8477179705880937
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation.	3.611981149408433
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups.	2.4035021562135666
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	3.8140521061315673
Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation.	2.9044405740413097
This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	2.58483627113977
Certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations, in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom, in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure, which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.	3.012304822617269
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council' s position, but I should also like that position to be equally credible.	3.184806302601056
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands.	3.688337585014266
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data.	2.3056386050671276
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances, many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect.	3.1289161806749166
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years.	2.156149163397156
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones.	2.252639118163347
At the moment, the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem.	3.0561972444737173
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	2.1972637085054654
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process.	1.5391785432282814
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation.	2.1113577874921914
I feel that today' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider' s party.	3.517743784280291
This is my first additional question.	2.7582155053392303
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	1.4859015613596753
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this?	3.954224593307421
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions.	3.138261270954805
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme (B7-4012).	1.670544840431339
Nevertheless, our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware, Mr Sjöstedt, that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations.	3.475158341268572
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	2.894523363770069
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying.	3.7497345760916065
Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon.	1.7964682731476675
Brittany and Galicia, two European 'Lands Ends' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks.	1.9971811886644526
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve.	2.7347444408578117
However, it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union.	3.9083848217145944
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy.	2.4366408161633086
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays.	2.9362883521489795
We have enough agreements; they just need to be implemented.	2.779523049122445
The whole of the Union must have the same protection, a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting, not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation.	3.4563830779519975
There must also be savings.	4.183826626306825
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	1.7209284155490698
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated.	3.52603240794474
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less.	2.0525317880606924
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.	3.520990774838782
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	2.572572267098135
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	3.536127709219845
(PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this.	2.845024693115666
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152.	2.37542716107096
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets.	1.6693356158706092
However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.	2.356049200760723
In this regard, it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit.	2.6004600578982666
Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour.	2.8427472748856046
After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table.	2.6672681531772016
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	3.9103997479513453
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place.	2.4347745839161608
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	2.2845471612169836
As you can see, as a new MEP, I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so.	3.2779603706622193
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland.	1.932656130154825
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	2.3680314263113154
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal.	4.071839723936223
For the first time, the European Union tabled a resolution on the death penalty, which was enormously successful, and led work on a resolution concerning children' s rights, which was a joint initiative with the Latin American group of countries.	3.0120303662056593
Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	3.187077699496725
This is, and will continue to be, connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation.	2.864150299555201
Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists.	2.4385396703719575
Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions.	3.371784157744389
One example is the use of peat.	3.936159052162031
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project, which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire, to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex.	2.625216613068932
Furthermore, it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament.	2.4323399960423195
Mr President, firstly I would like to express my very sincere thanks, not only for the initiatives of the different groups, of Mrs Grossetête and the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats, but also for the initiatives of Mr Wurtz and the Confederal Group of the United Left/Nordic Green Left, who proposed this debate, which has led to a positive and important discussion.	2.9986761457757303
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	2.147015187417177
We trusted this Commission, from the outset, to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women.	2.351010374951142
The company went under despite this.	1.4243786018629214
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket?	1.596009634142204
Firstly, the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors, with the backing of the European Investment Bank.	3.4496956509570786
In this area we have to work with the world as it is, and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation.	4.753361017473426
It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences.	3.336437128475743
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur.	2.3072982992028823
Mr President, Commissioner, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group.	3.7585287198212933
They need a political deal.	2.167031851574773
However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low.	3.592013788447533
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too.	3.4617664852062107
According to the information which the Commission services have given me, this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel, means and inspectors.	2.842811670146787
To explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles.	2.1238489098271147
In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be.	2.931264169983943
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy.	2.684999123627974
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote.	2.2319982529816214
Russia' s new strong man, however, added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration: 'As far as I am aware, Mr Babitsky already feels free.'	2.2233390723071618
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage.	2.6319431928130244
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere.	3.1890719429970185
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability, of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain, is part of that confidence-building mechanism.	2.575757978024976
Although these floods began three weeks ago, the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in: there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport, particularly air transport, to get them out of the situation they are in.	2.331578632341136
We all know that!	6.789728383478419
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question.	4.034605635215897
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it.	1.8106394176688525
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives.	2.377145496126508
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.	3.803916098209224
Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees.	5.600620063424522
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15%, 20% or 25% which are unrealistic in the long term.	1.6883763316691438
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives.	1.8318280724857259
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	2.892753325353486
Today we must give the green light to this conference, and, for its part, the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr President, is ready to give that green light.	3.0263879543134764
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words.	3.1326491379301045
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	3.3421826791291953
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name.	3.2445601935409734
Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	2.623486484848536
As for the inspections, very much a key question, the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked, as Mr Hatzidakis has said.	3.1577078099116056
I would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two Members who were named in this particular BBC interview are not running their companies from this Parliament or from parliamentary offices, because that would be a very serious matter indeed.	2.5590758046892987
I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much.	3.1303172207061483
One of the most important things, for me, personally, is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under.	3.217727644286159
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars.	1.8468097148823759
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	2.5874729391901896
This war must be stopped.	1.949876667000417
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre, thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible.	1.6819842201799544
Calling under these circumstances, as he does in paragraph 20, for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological outbidding tactics which are customary in this House.	2.4727001638608543
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters.	2.2449318981985695
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.	2.978405323403102
I can partly accept Amendment No 11.	2.131284943278263
Besides, Commissioner, is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo?	2.4059309520108583
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	2.4260071867174484
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because, in the final analysis, it is our health which is at stake.	3.4619604827813686
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold.	2.0224951512823672
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago.	3.517040797762316
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny.	2.1488808684351204
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard.	3.359108142314898
We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.39720970772564
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks?	2.273673804422157
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this.	2.778758441281136
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way.	4.7758932222692625
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	2.349327154643187
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach.	2.750399381477596
It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions!	2.8014870200136586
VOTE	21.75018985665072
It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission.	2.9907021605094952
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution.	3.993294477486635
There are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy, but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system.	2.9380744621412065
However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.	4.490208016889082
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics.	2.344848772798234
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming.	3.7634694448577464
However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct.	3.055085950497808
In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff.	3.709017919175534
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.	3.185065819045835
This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative.	2.613314082519688
. The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters.	3.1647920519311037
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet.	3.177308475932891
What is left, for example, of the right of Austrians to choose their own destiny, if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner, as they were recently by you in Portugal, Mr President of the Council.	2.439899059419036
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	3.1669167190436585
In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today.	3.0348453151130053
In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain.	2.102964128962901
Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' .	2.8769620043361104
In this respect I would like to tell you that the Commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality, on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance.	3.704543992518933
However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive.	3.5088949814144783
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions.	1.6415601289196589
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council.	3.128949993411194
In the autumn the Commission will report back on the progress made in this respect.	3.5344365165569056
But we must also play a political role and Mr Moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own; the Presidency of the Council must take action, the EU High Representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the Russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves.	2.6806988629627035
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy.	3.1366407802329603
This is a responsibility that the European Union takes very seriously, Mr Posselt, and I would like to mention that, at the General Affairs Council held on Monday, this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing Kosovo.	3.5088072388593154
Mr President, the facts are well-known.	10.273322480471103
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	2.2610425965397805
As Mr Sterckx said, we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which, after all, is close to us in terms of democratic values.	4.145092450421374
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event.	1.825769723754836
Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries.	2.0230870743098555
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well.	3.1992448575827783
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	2.7083604623645807
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes.	4.4277958866289735
With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities.	4.425448149934324
In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context.	3.6506623753319336
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	3.4793287339372108
With regard to the environmental impact, it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions: pollution, over-fishing, changes in climate, etc. It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock.	2.3782256917722147
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text.	2.7520450039498843
It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence.	3.2819054629582083
By definition, investment funds use other people' s money.	2.045448166902097
Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	2.7118110009998553
It is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the EU.	2.282137539322086
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences.	2.4548876752391555
Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities, non-governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation.	2.424797068889558
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	2.4629966196082074
Unfortunately, very little.	1.915584037525735
It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security.	2.350896504923287
Human rights	72.17482167067989
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned.	2.7393053808920715
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one.	3.317820761782677
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	3.196999360159818
We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors.	2.8834389718131215
If not, we will be fighting a running battle.	3.490115990966937
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard.	4.319965546883671
Mr President, most of the time, the European Parliament, spearheaded by environment committees, does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the European Commission or the Council, so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view.	4.301606548514426
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	2.5274534917291342
Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures, in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6.	2.7293985629802844
Firstly, its continuity, which, in principle, I am not questioning.	4.048892276294962
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support.	2.7057357609983708
Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95.	2.1716259165303398
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions.	3.073433285276379
Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten	3.332444416293962
I also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and to make progress in adapting Community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses.	3.0427585176468717
I am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well.	2.889737968024833
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	3.1034535367836398
I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, "The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000" - you can see how topical this is - "the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."	2.1632461872900675
Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face.	3.0692327812487346
We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	2.8576789549116572
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	3.272842301089379
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate, it is evident that it is an important one.	4.00161918784306
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers.	3.0663202915585996
But opinion differs as to the solution.	2.8924384023181164
I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council.	3.9752475031482977
. (DA) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market, which ought to be promoted and encouraged.	3.3747253204084675
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here.	2.4533289299308163
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly, by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud.	2.4160953199090938
In the important debate on competition this morning, I expressed my views on Mr Langen' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code.	2.491926453066326
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services.	3.3798966927890572
Mr President, ever since Plato' s 'Republic' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts.	3.1080106823236906
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	1.8705518013953897
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.	2.20789592182586
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	2.497865325611652
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	3.099519086389726
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies.	2.438933574782615
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	2.9571053917224153
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services.	2.0115670460098567
Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that.	3.1303888291723827
In my view, it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments, including this one, so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means.	3.3091962368098207
We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad.	3.2318275229640148
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly.	3.210576747618275
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30% of ethnic Albanians in government activity, in government policy and in society, is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.	2.4313792159777887
The debate in Geneva, however, is more focused on human rights issues.	4.053939478273223
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	2.0801014150502475
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle.	2.6403936110220774
In addition, and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system, the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - "the second key" as Herr Bösch said, established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts.	2.8803231405621617
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision.	2.479144252098652
In any case, I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them, notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances.	2.5174686033586404
Mr President, one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy: the flag flies high, as Mrs Malmström put it.	2.836266916393766
That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far.	3.947615895017952
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system.	2.896183464504235
We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates.	2.4415492519750948
I believe that Turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty, but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in Europe and I think it is quite right to discuss them here in Parliament.	4.0740862091804155
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit.	2.604565975932409
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment, industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries.	3.0733801894709276
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine.	3.043811196787084
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.	2.3213731800501174
In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal.	3.3199578279610904
I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters.	2.8852070657940714
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments, and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which, as debated by the Polish parliament, fill 140 000 sides of paper.	2.3775141536277355
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.	2.0241017961820806
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	2.665572448771819
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away.	5.503871931575105
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed.	2.4283200901653546
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	2.8897193890827233
It is, I think, regrettable that the Commission could not make a similar assessment of LEADER II, regarding the quality of the projects, the quantity of appropriations spent and, most especially, the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered.	3.254809771874859
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	3.651293602284579
Madam President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen Member States and shares the concern that gave rise to that view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning, as soon as the Commission could discuss the issue, it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the Member States.	3.099592386729761
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	3.376833499114346
(Applause from the PSE Group)	2.2516470636649086
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue.	5.92226253173489
Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation.	3.376052010398055
In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty.	3.939344363274434
Mr President of the Commission, if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions, then this Union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people.	3.3316674138042037
Some of our working practices need radical reform.	2.0845013447314007
This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States.	3.5225546360103066
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective.	4.1638999280879725
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability.	6.084432358247796
We could not agree with a proposal like this, which challenged the authority of the European Parliament.	3.530264642672872
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	3.012829051603987
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise.	2.0728143335785085
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions.	2.581721694278758
Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days.	3.8676223257517943
The Council therefore expressed its satisfaction, in its December conclusions, at the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission, which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal, together with similar contributions made by Member States.	2.83011296707922
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share.	3.6015877905461924
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans.	4.381293253808776
What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union.	3.606862653650525
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	2.130054902463866
In an article entitled "If women ruled the world" , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence.	2.2142981229784207
We need a body of food law, as you have said, and we need to agree this together.	4.61726711945397
Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud.	2.493150559334411
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication.	3.2645181444409888
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would, in all normal circumstances, wish to do.	3.42854275538063
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?	6.665048577225562
Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred.	2.466778207251971
Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	2.8794410860481308
Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject.	2.7786271482685496
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments.	3.7881071690388666
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	2.5722340777615016
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today.	3.52629188499116
We can, and must, take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century, a century which is globalising fast.	2.1475698167976836
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country.	2.324611643873117
The Commission' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, human, animal and plant health.	3.2262462717348384
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	3.734892108623358
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report.	3.725399935914917
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed.	2.531499857844402
For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply.	3.031563437277284
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	2.5196170009157366
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon.	2.22386148929407
The Commission' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, which we have debated this week, contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject, except the reminder, in a single line, that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 January 2002.	2.996344132885425
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	2.351917912151469
.	77.3301660757284
Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia.	3.0686839523676683
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does?	2.2005432501840745
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar, but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner' s outstanding bills.	2.7683385145000705
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this?	2.9587638341367315
If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason.	2.032661651791581
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.	4.788427857109317
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme.	2.9786689628813523
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998.	2.4061176236710717
Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything.	1.6821247004620141
Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us.	2.0080074851476977
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	3.721057131969428
It is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used.	3.222858502734279
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	1.8612688771251729
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure.	3.110696950880785
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	2.1924579425768633
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come.	1.5386672519420266
Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	3.164637973601307
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	4.125340932445391
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself.	1.476536063800738
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions.	1.8325628172396622
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities, as they do not have enough resources.	3.3560469728716553
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process.	5.393342615870873
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group.	2.91602606801755
Take, for example, the pledges made by the Commission. They look good in themselves.	2.9316908878117283
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality, without governments reacting?	2.2318048632125747
However, in this regard I share Mr Salafranca' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week, namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe.	2.7195793824340613
This body, for example, alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety, is already doing good work.	2.4282242492731365
We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement.	3.8176366387319614
He was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas.	3.3213021703317587
Madam President, Mr Prodi, Europe needs a strong Commission.	3.787077371172469
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	3.8369651670528513
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution.	3.187137517417567
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	2.829522419572748
Social exclusion, the programme for women, the efforts we are making in the social protection area, everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society.	3.595029139862662
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	3.266028021604058
Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ?	2.366547710885973
We need to match this vision with reality.	3.2991508730439763
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision, establishing this element of conditionality.	2.8854642249145077
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF, particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean.	2.530780711366984
I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo?	2.903045272164249
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual.	2.808071206710905
Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson.	8.094631064138223
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive.	1.7106725558484361
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery.	1.692324344023711
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay.	1.782751790350373
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	2.3608582653427677
Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation.	3.6052281443799066
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits.	1.7822981911332978
Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist.	3.1729862442137273
Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould.	4.569152423095421
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit.	2.576343152766786
Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group.	3.663967454388071
Almost three weeks after the disaster, several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones, 500 000 hectares of forestry land, or 100 million cubic metres of forest, have been ruined, and our historical heritage has also been affected, as the sad example of the park at the Palace of Versailles demonstrates.	2.399016701120496
I wanted to ask the Commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the NATO armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area?	2.8789093537498873
It is, of course, the responsibility of policies, and therefore our responsibility, to guarantee the safety of sea transport.	3.7649563206961223
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	3.054711058035363
As a result, we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed.	3.0257695170654597
Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States.	2.9462270559133112
However, we should look a little more closely at some points.	3.8176209010744016
The Greek Government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed, firstly, to restructuring public sector employment services in Greece, secondly, to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and, thirdly, to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable IT systems to monitor all these policies.	2.197522342489572
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders).	1.8236781302238418
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located.	2.7062362514054765
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem, it shelves it.	2.9699040755350543
However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	2.850654319424465
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.	3.008528194162667
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this.	4.172272646847232
ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned.	2.4775513305252788
This is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work, not just by securing approval for the EU strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium, but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists, particularly at Council level, on issues concerning the fight against organised crime.	3.395215541078653
In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population.	2.753480263181222
I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court.	3.9235821422625894
This is an important matter.	7.254426294885275
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	2.853626641391615
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement.	3.5951161140198415
I want to mention, as has already been mentioned by many speakers today, that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the EU during the next two decades.	3.2614111681340776
Can you please do something about it?	2.320662784041901
On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles?	2.374439992158674
I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area.	3.2593072863706474
As far as we, the Council presidency, are concerned, we will continue to follow these developments very closely, and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter.	4.095820992400141
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People's Party or does the Austrian People's Party continue to sit in that political group?	2.2302510757212857
I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it.	2.3660738587461156
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.	3.446333277238771
As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session.	2.98584455221726
Secondly, I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment, it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment, or to support an increase in employment.	4.1246693428929
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that, because of the need for division of labour between the international donors, the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation.	3.080160417238262
To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies.	3.3610722393199595
I appreciate Mrs Cederschiöld' s work, and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the Tampere Summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied.	2.1583343334458758
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.	1.9212099229402857
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	2.222869789263221
There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all.	2.4071728715603737
What do they see?	3.1919339671935485
And who is not in favour of security, freedom and justice?	5.036717402940502
Commissioner, far too little is said in your paper about regional policy.	2.06619152921279
Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times.	4.992518827885257
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.	2.628393330985476
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	2.4213135372206307
Taking these aspects into account, I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind, as proposed, and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF.	3.41776277930353
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days.	3.3561613639075136
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type.	2.363790743491127
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	3.0122200769112397
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation, without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy, the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression.	2.43087258123893
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State.	3.6241197795083577
We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment.	2.103835246979901
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and, on the other, more widespread exclusion.	3.9218517784955655
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question.	3.2419575539824455
States can carry out port inspections.	1.6353912206991914
I remain at your service in order, when the time comes, to present the report of previous planning which you request, but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning.	3.096639938107315
I do not have these concerns.	7.419479221001678
Please excuse this very legal answer.	1.451611190573728
We should get it into perspective.	1.8514734527978551
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians.	2.0795834851212827
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country.	1.934504956789085
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93/75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States?	2.0195436504437403
What is the Council's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project?	4.410330997201605
What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient.	4.47104033254788
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds.	2.140961720294966
Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts.	4.858911002311476
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.	3.2882848631637334
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	3.2596135570088722
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history.	2.1901814495283234
And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security.	2.844890057732524
I wish you a good evening.	2.173772728465141
First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented.	4.918249851187752
Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate.	3.090481587613123
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities.	2.154534923850494
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March.	3.0369003767588167
Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies?	2.0654262742955716
The second point is human resources.	3.4043379288053286
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner.	3.556370042879527
.	77.3301660757284
This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation.	2.475970471153539
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.	2.509329536155919
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	2.773440346590678
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	2.7588563329044273
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union.	2.0981016606996494
So, Madam President, maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance.	2.4473081335369278
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council.	2.89064997034789
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	2.471085139466612
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	3.965249086644617
In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation.	2.7945209484898306
It would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because I can see a particular problem with coordination, specifically between the Commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments, but also members of national parliaments - and our committee' s programme. Following the working meeting of 1 February, which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission, the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings.	2.7273717123811085
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	2.280748934371109
- (DE) Mr President, the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper European financial area, which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency, but also to increase competition.	2.7028884400995885
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45.	1.9401727724607263
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court.	3.7638868835671104

B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party,	2.8988371317962303
Madam President, as a member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party, I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer, Jorge Díez Elorza, and the Basque MP and former vice-president, Fernando Buesa.	2.6941702484443777
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	2.96025137155957
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree.	2.659767192702786
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	2.9423179551552634
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product.	2.0250370278371594
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party.	2.5177387700582976
There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle.	2.01078264806646
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard?	2.5668618034324924
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives.	2.0816410591564565
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety.	2.6028496496919735
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds.	3.7863244134563816
McNally Report (A5-0082/1999)	1.288342709821954
I repeat, Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster.	2.3362176728624835
Mr President, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive.	4.9188587078664225
In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties.	2.7552951853375784
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future.	2.179276792406279
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000.	2.760564185137998
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	2.756177750951759
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.	3.1140228972440087
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	3.623012182389762
So if the European Union, the Council and the Commission are proposing - and I assume that Parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south-eastern Europe, in the Balkan region - I am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that FYROM itself has worked its way into a good position, in economic and, of course, mainly in political terms, in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority.	3.289057265066214
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern.	1.7161919360452305
, rapporteur.	1.3017874054835612
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium.	2.5947461021599825
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount.	2.395149525743574
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press.	3.7891602322372426
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	2.5246758130439484
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats.	2.9803330435416453
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	2.508324434003715
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon.	2.6927379139416225
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament, as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations, consumer protection associations and the public.	3.489184423190672
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.	1.8453404063201564
We must point out, however, that even if the actual appropriations available for LEADER + were increased, the Community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti-farming nature of the CAP that will be implemented in the context of 'Agenda 2000' and the WTO. The real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover-up, to lead people off the scent and to salve consciences.	2.7607432836615238
This is a war which transcends its borders. It is not just UNITA which is to blame.	4.387098968304456
In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken.	3.044325040142345
Naturally, it is not in the first place a question of cost; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided.	3.3006481552127798
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place.	3.253529722037293
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice.	1.9954566825079134
Mr President, in accordance with Article 69 (2), I call for referral back to committee.	3.478257509905289
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	2.8364057968149687
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	1.783166023565772
We have failed to achieve a qualified majority.	3.49631972322124
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references, and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article.	2.573650645529507
Take the trade agreements.	1.6968258401457985
That seems to me to be rather too long.	2.705215584934334
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	3.8352653813911672
It is obviously the Commission' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General, but this is precisely what we do not want.	3.822130677837795
That is all to the good.	3.452624023164647
Mrs Lucas should do the same.	2.0611163355483715
I would ask you to confirm that, if an official has said that an Austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects, then this official has got the wrong end of the stick, and that, if he has not said this, then there is no story.	3.2554208740258788
This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment.	2.9178328129421356
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission.	2.644430361147143
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States' obligations are laid down in detail. There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation.	2.9491384613589253
I think, therefore, that paragraph 7 contains something very central, i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies.	2.4154061454048197
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	1.6530094121396874
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography. 'We are in Europe.	1.5113415012902192
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	3.0741785344690222
There are certain other key issues: relations with Ukraine, relations with Russia, relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly, the important question of relations with the southern Mediterranean which will be a crucial point for European history, and for security and peace in Europe for future generations. In this regard, we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa.	2.965097335473836
Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely, effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers' and employees' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced.	1.8313047010305203
Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' .	2.2314864241689887
(PT) The Commission' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. It is therefore crucial that the European Parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity, given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective Member States.	2.8395851297964017
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.	3.6158188470228643
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy, and will be applying a number of tests.	4.377270885007448
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this.	4.9190292654688585
Cross-border services	72.17482167067989
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised.	2.4408075214228027
It is not a quota!	11.640601578049317
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty.	3.3050675238977942
Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights.	2.3305878012760486
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	1108.7151899121682
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear.	2.943126711946478
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	1.5238227066436483
In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded.	4.188817058506994
Nonetheless, I agree with you, Mr President of the Commission, that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge, inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which, to put it mildly, have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent.	2.938989743540061
The situation of Turkey's relations with its neighbours will, as the honourable Member asks, be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy.	2.9043781037438783
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	2.6223311670960228
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	2.690348777609024
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States.	3.536229194173437
There is huge duplication of effort.	1.4244306211962305
I can understand your concern.	2.6384199591390933
Third, there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment.	3.309733310501187
At the same time, we are aware that this is a massive programme and that, during the overhaul in the next couple of years, it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in, as before.	3.947752561406389
And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle.	3.623867330476329
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary, by making commercial interests subservient to human rights, to which so much lip service is being paid.	2.9109558475664485
The foul monster has been reawakened!	2.765776990025166
. (IT) The report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in Europe will be accompanied by an analogous process of cohesion.	2.9179455818710496
Many directives have already been adopted. Furthermore, the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives.	2.9850307966743794
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	1.747192099003276
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda.	3.0807824670795942
Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery.	2.7268466788719166
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work.	2.1191179940517872
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but, over the years, it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.	2.3679466764274224
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements, or the OSPAR objectives.	3.5364711325922897
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	3.772494891967465
The introduction of these new technologies is not a threat, but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services, which our tourism needs for an ever-lengthening tourism season, so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism.	2.391292543265521
It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis.	4.310119074118784
Mr President, over the years, the following situation has arisen: one subject has developed into a subject of many facets.	2.942535963464092
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	2.755739908488322
It will most certainly be necessary, we say, because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable, to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits.	2.272787750866534
It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU.	3.599119392855282
So, once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability.	2.2653414239491565
I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012.	3.093816215043314
As you yourself said, Commissioner, these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes, and we think that these are the first signs of climate change.	3.119391534672257
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	3.158249266205596
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce.	2.9832083209827265
This White Paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us, an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions, rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at Union level when the Member States number 25 or 30, and what will be the best thing to do at individual State level, at regional level and at local government level.	2.6018386050251374
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.	2.0850089125221705
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very quickly like to make one point. Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency.	3.029331030819347
In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust.	3.041978815030015
In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.	2.3759063160795675
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House.	4.025910730506857
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union.	2.3351987802249528
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission.	2.596934901890818
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature.	3.268183781301449
This is why this report is so important.	5.489650479947509
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	3.8026414149939916
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit.	2.461319821945046
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided, we must say that external offices will be used.	3.451642598224215
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	3.5579745910387643
I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement.	2.353364568480393
Amendment No 12 responds to the expectations of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of this House.	2.657784797863845
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements.	3.333351616063777
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large.	2.839698484548504
We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future.	2.206779725466613
That goes without saying, but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term.	3.0456816384385785
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	2.3951680923326113
We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union.	2.8716388695372514
In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible.	2.879813889418452
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year.	2.5861605006921184
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	1.8336609721352835
I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result.	3.6945133087071977
OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud.	3.6022591581463685
During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved.	3.271622712702068
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered.	2.761196699962066
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed.	3.127068860494782
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds.	4.108792762707141
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted.	2.7786426249562326
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly.	1.8891568692051608
There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.	1.8731323918061995
We should not be bribing these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction, giving them money to absorb laws which are as alien to their culture as a black hole is to Mother Earth.	2.3556019082499735
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster.	2.5043243420099572
We will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions, the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even, more fundamentally, the global balance.	2.251902219786767
If Amendment No 45 does not fall, I will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that Member States may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services.	2.8809036049114076
Secondly, I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently.	3.532713847847565
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	2.8827238416969134
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people.	2.483035499986139
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.	4.346493780493729
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	2.489979710717341
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far.	1.8621634479173743
So far as the September communication is concerned, it is unprecedented.	5.215516001406798
Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region.	2.9877331829397007
That will require a new political culture, not only in words, but also in practice, which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions.	4.101113829740184
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria.	2.734398795871034
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States.	2.244294906982169
Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House.	2.964359491610602
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	3.2942893148182146
Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly.	3.183132223419567
Do we have any figures?	3.644819109722591
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty.	1.8049654231556806
We will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which I regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this House and for outlining future prospects. The time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted.	2.315210357021552
My third point has also been mentioned already.	2.761733990154631
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year.	2.5031616249366326
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments.	2.4311000989716995
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00):	1.1672026996941478
Unfortunately, a number of deadlines have been exceeded.	2.9383157960869455
rapporteur.	77.3301660757284
In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures 'without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role ... in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.'	2.767294875067102
But we need that reform process.	3.337418431795844
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be.	2.033466957699768
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	3.4030381497559046
Unfortunately, it was then changed, and changed for the worse, which turned it into a document which in fact, proposes something that we cannot accept.	2.868921217819618
It is also a timely discussion - as Mr Pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the Lisbon Summit, which intends to find out how we can put economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe via the Information Society.	2.6993165142370836
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	2.67963188007287
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	2.787481446774333
It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU.	3.812709047458989
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	2.4992827682083143
I will monitor this situation very closely. If necessary, within and pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation, I will make comments on the use made, not of Structural Funds which are not yet committed, but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these Structural Funds.	3.103175370409332
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say.	2.5797074030607243
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries.	4.326493973146628
I think, however, that common rules have to be applied to this sector, so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the Wild West, or even the Wild East. We need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service.	3.2042579141552636
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
More specifically, with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean, we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs.	3.4378675385095443
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding.	2.1456681850055763
One last word regarding the programme. I think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there.	3.261431787289824
Although a few other groups have been mentioned, it is the Member States, in particular, which are on the lookout.	5.022046013894478
The honourable Member raised the question.	4.142925184557158
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million.	2.3274762966781526
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme, because there remains a shortcoming in the report.	3.0748999429731056
While Commissioner Patten' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.	2.0171939199443374
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated.	1.6872379272464064
It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion.	2.341683488924668
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress.	3.313658771561927
Those realities, together with the approach of further enlargements, all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission, so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development, of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness, maximum responsibility and maximum accountability.	2.365656325848669
As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character.	2.053277789202625
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
I am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so-called EU passport.	2.102756337971418
This is not in question.	9.022191978822557
We need to look very carefully at those.	3.7231074946548306
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe.	1.639300061636882
However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing.	3.8310990525997797
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!	3.2738834908151384
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	2.9243607170390686
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.4985632424871724
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe.	3.1504478759686756
Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: "With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika.	2.504104405052339
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	3.2646539898336364
I do not know what the metric equivalent is.	3.3350645530553793
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report (A5-0018/2000)	1.1856624812447194
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met?	2.1857844450796935
First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied.	3.2775516548637005
It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.	3.08174487127673
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	2.3161688965310363
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products.	2.5670622419819957
Like a previous speaker, I also fully support the appeals which have been made.	3.2575982010223887
May I quickly add something to the answer given just now by Mrs Wallström to Mr Martin?	1.770955949435963
Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process.	3.517502335214779
Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS))	2.143316671367644
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	2.240678080977132
We must never forget to defend civil society.	1.5007799777226898
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin.	2.302447680523675
What is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and publishers are persecuted, as the young historian Jean Plantin was just yesterday before the Court of Appeal, in my home town of Lyon - he was the subject of an absurd, arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout, the smug expression of straitjacketed thinking and intellectual conformism?	2.6509260545723383
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works.	1.7173733780514213
Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations.	3.199520983105449
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action.	3.141530149798438
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.	1.6315477668196803
This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	3.2204455569911383
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace.	3.403298298159058
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved.	2.7470866481191636
By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	2.719444297401007
Question No 46 by (H-0052/00):	1.1672026996941478
Mr Byrne, we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work.	3.08018025375423
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure.	3.746061863053447
Fifthly, to publish an annual scientific, technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out.	1.9013106936804145
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors.	2.266303240963554
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented, farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly, which resulted in their depopulation.	2.4491336103737678
No, of course not.	6.843654633316758
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented.	3.032997124663394
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system.	2.808423406562759
Mr Havel reminded us that the Union is not just about markets, about GDP growth, it is a Union of values that is reflected in the Treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance, reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do.	3.125140534394407
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors, with the possibility, following negotiation, of increasing it to 54 hours.	2.5963429872503383
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe.	3.3798834849219785
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully understand the frustration of Mr Di Pietro who, in a short space of time, has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today.	3.0679030554505364
We have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that Jörg Haider stands for.	2.540220102240022
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.2819488876076677
In this respect, we support Libya' s participation, provided that it recognises human rights, renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process.	2.5685773048847573
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	4.027635089725065
As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy.	2.7301146953075395
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period.	3.3471723439633796
No human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the acolytes of the new world order are saying today, the new world order which reigns almost unchallenged in financial circles, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, and in educational institutions, to mention but a few.	3.4154999983829555
The Commission has no means of influence here.	3.6419809588844267
So, the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all.	2.644833386094773
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services.	3.071281269315719
But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation.	3.907538582968612
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue.	3.2017582662358115
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society.	2.8577830610707062
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	2.113263722532111
They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said.	2.622812195512089
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights.	2.2424516840948265
Furthermore, Europe has signed international conventions, in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments.	3.0642038499010846
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	2.827494415043678
The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	2.094744602990102
Commissioner Byrne, it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament.	2.7590009112699407
I should like to raise three points which for us, as Members of the PPE Group, must be focal points when such an area is created.	3.3469108572559563
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU's areas of competence.	2.255904945346806
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us.	3.6600141002133917
More than anything, the country needs peace and quiet now, in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity.	2.9402664405059107
First of all, I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly, but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control.	3.0460981406455274
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	2.8360958039913187
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm.	2.5251727344743222
We need to make our citizens feel at home, according to Mr Swoboda, and I agree.	5.123810738654803
Indeed, this is one advantage of the present system.	5.605770762751036
In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate.	4.3550987594364114
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings.	2.998386077775262
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there.	2.2516407112356127
These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them.	3.9995947908007463
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.268646800656208
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future. In other words, what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves, what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide?	2.9949520698318164
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?	2.5257808597903666
Therefore, once our legislation has been brought into line, we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law. We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the 'polluter pays' principle of responsibility which is, of course, supposed to be a deterrent.	2.8784270935411866
Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century.	2.7305604678071322
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness.	3.049793470757998
On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card.	2.806923870113063
The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.	2.1666185600979855
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union.	2.577779938332385
If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation.	3.835885905822591
I shall take the floor very briefly, Madam President.	2.9435618260252805
I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate.	3.2590670639729162
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	2.9369416874080456
When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change.	2.699285518585771
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	3.052430122410079
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	1.5592282134619782
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative	2.110740319054272
Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG?	2.911976709679942
We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process.	2.412617573402075
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to bear all the cost.	2.396331715952537
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	3.465156936062849
I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented.	3.159852295174424
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	2.6809485569748768
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner.	2.82078998567106
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.	2.5912936856207502
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	2.7184450186456273
What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call "le parcours du combatant", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment.	2.5984640663721588
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy.	2.9195367351120898
First, funding for preparation; second, implementation; third, mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience, and fourth, technical assistance.	2.09164145322796
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.	1.8903675789259595
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	2.4652769844454
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	3.604488908606075
Firstly, is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners?	3.5428699350826496
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	2.592343304654919
This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies.	2.6544677905535625
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	4.038741233176098
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	2.5636656641747506
We are losing market share.	1.7906733299316715
This, unfortunately, is not the case in Ireland.	5.319337898268763
If Europe has any meaning, and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.	2.2263965247265465
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.	2.66423584044882
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	3.3665392214782774
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	3.278517817599256
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and, above all, for their proposals.	3.9013119193704564
The actual appropriations available for LEADER + compared with LEADER 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15% (from EUR 1 775 million for LEADER 2 to EUR 2 020 million for LEADER +).	1.8759214160108415
Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques.	1.8159287744953845
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments.	4.284140780838724
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them.	1.9419327512771916
Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract.	2.5420107480320047
It is the result, first and foremost, of the ghettoisation and exploitation of immigrant labour.	5.1044285155807945
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue.	4.031138983697056
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	2.257918522264852
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on.	2.9220782753871277
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	2.294007786848033
Relating to Amendment No 31	1.3661090577094717
Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment.	2.572066178509799
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently.	3.0009621819041845
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities, the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but, unfortunately, their troubles are not yet over.	3.302166842617439
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks, we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective.	2.5739836707051635
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the 'continentalisation' of the European Union.	2.21633255846724
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds.	2.6424177397833155
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent.	1.648100119624243
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds?	2.2470498735338826
I do not want to minimise these, but progress is being made as far as strand A cooperation with candidate countries is concerned, even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain.	3.189276772640219
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	2.0562411382082653
Read Mr Katiforis' s report again, in which he says that in Scotland, for example, 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned, and impact upon the environment.	2.646496405193639
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again.	3.5879819477278807
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General.	3.9257153772579128
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow.	2.193200509344712
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions.	3.0578442146699216
So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible.	2.4796655476921474
Social policy must facilitate employment, creating incentives for employers and employees to, respectively, provide and accept jobs.	1.697575453935196
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger.	1.8623977138360697
Mr Medina Ortega, I naturally share your concerns and I can assure you that a coastal country like my own, the country currently holding the presidency, is naturally very concerned about this issue, all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own.	3.065011713695234
However, I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State.	2.995613403364974
Yet, there is some risk of dilution of effort. If we pursue too many objectives, our overall effectiveness suffers.	2.1018172719086405
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	2.277344233714488
We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem.	3.3339300788480957
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	3.0205690076292733
On the same day, I understand, Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead.	2.4589720582349672
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully.	3.2344822473049732
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless.	1.8041788609836045
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording.	3.597530042493084
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3, financed by LEADER, with those of other actions financed by other Community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership, such as INTERREG, SAPAR, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, in the same areas.	2.6707623960093394
Of course, a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States, and a network which will assist the exchange of experience.	3.894333658794338
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	3.525224258421068
Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days.	3.196006671365138
Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that, as a general rule, the European Parliament will adopt its resolution, stating its reasons, at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the Commission adopts the draft implementing measure.	2.7172755432733915
Firstly, we need a successful European economy.	4.8645712860136
However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment.	2.9378993572922107
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson.	2.9463486151262344
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration.	3.165095823752172
As far as the budget is concerned, as already stated, URBAN is there to support and complement national policy.	3.335184993897367
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work.	3.9987842394480237
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	2.663851158456541
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	2.1987491301643276
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba.	3.534372891840642
The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the "stabilisation and association process" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability.	2.7925804852199096
It is also important that a debate is held where the long-term effects of mining in this region are discussed and weighed up in economic, ecological and social terms.	2.6805069523366565
This is totally unacceptable.	1.6115613792273713
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments.	1.9867244968693145
SAVE	21.75018985665072
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work?	3.212223654730338
Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995.	2.242468702280212
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser.	2.627787574037128
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)	2.565304505970121
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital.	1.6552290111469963
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible?	2.5068828572411244
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up.	3.7609826031253886
Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way.	3.746778159553565
In the Commission guidelines, few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA. The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented.	2.262663103225952
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions.	2.596264642040051
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement.	2.059464723404704
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries.	1.8040364528738897
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.	3.080365963087982
I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision.	3.5619178466313555
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process.	1.6814887385416923
We want a colourful Europe.	4.260946622048848
A paper this short is a farce.	1.5034821360453892
It is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, and we believe that on the basis of work already done, it will be possible, at least in the field of seizure of assets, for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions.	3.759975669558029
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay.	3.0044564480403
Finally, a compassionate thought for all the volunteers, nature lovers and bird lovers, who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds, organising rescue operation with the means available.	2.4581709559888196
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?	3.0755914647728195
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	2.8636837421948704
At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread.	3.179307086811534
Finally, once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed, we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment, as proposed by the Commission with the support of this House. In this strategy, young people and women, training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention.	2.93120757792526
One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.	3.7623040105284664
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0142/2000) by Messrs Mrs Hautala, Mr Lannoye and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the strategic objectives for 2000-2005	3.1921086988203933
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	3.0504179520194485
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer' s freedom of choice.	2.2642412893311854
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	2.9878626621142748
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	3.561024323094455
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	2.2546005113581056
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States.	2.796609901954687
I really think that people should be extremely cautious.	2.0625138606192652
When we talk of transparency in the food chain, that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs.	3.1208780789694464
And now the Erika.	1.8528936557947846
Like Mr Radwan, I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition.	2.5822450734055784
Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.	3.2407386551999386
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers.	2.6296136508880994
In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice.	2.7442667241209535
To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture.	2.743974610703337
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament.	3.354792319455495
This is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a NATO context, but, as the European Union shares NATO' s view of these issues, it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this. I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council, so that there can be no doubt.	3.9791571715011913
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.	3.5180593305026493
The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	3.573696436276064
That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years!	2.2260679655673927
Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference.	3.399069304665525
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent.	1.9274387985630235
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union, has its relevant role to play.	3.5602305861847983
So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease.	3.817594513833298
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa, where violations are viewed as a necessary evil.	3.1503858679887435
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility.	2.8589494998874017
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation.	3.2966021305583677
It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now.	3.5068818731361397
Of course, the situation was not idyllic, even before the bombardments, anything but, I should say. However, since NATO' s intervention, there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment.	3.4148757342405225
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country.	3.5187197684439067
So that is the world as it is today.	5.3057147034750844
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries.	2.349931798127992
Nonetheless, as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned, overall, this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge.	2.8278500893817626
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words, but we will try to lead by example.	4.137296865151474
Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire.	2.4017531016382367
Mr President, there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	3.734374252577715
People should no longer be forced to move.	2.6342383299928454
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept.	2.2766763727728274
Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion.	2.1805796542899705
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme.	2.386302396926796
Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, under Directive 70/524, high-technology additives are treated differently, depending on the date of authorisation.	2.6468685938517464
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.	3.0545380437993535
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	1.8807891167556676
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community, reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe?	2.608093091543201
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	3.242566766965678
I wholeheartedly agree.	2.9352297338926494
This discussion is not new.	1.5829823644141312
The Community initiative means community involvement.	2.683513686273204
If further regulation is needed, we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive.	2.5091749718043843
Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction.	2.7777700683571824
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation.	3.279994811325792
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time.	4.418612573499614
Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart.	2.24014447804191
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement.	2.433901775163648
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House.	2.6318277059903497
Secondly, Cuba.	1.5960711524255125
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.	3.128268345062091
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago.	2.9159389136915377
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	3.036365467347247
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.	1.984992266146299
What are the Council's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)?	2.037429708201517
As a lack of coherence, one can cite as Mrs Sandbæk did, the exporting of milk products to Jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the Jamaican dairy industry.	2.4407602002517215
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question.	2.031542211787814
We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers.	2.477829077367807
I hope that, in the future, things will change and meetings will become frequent, because there are many issues which require the attention of the Commission in order to speed up and conclude, as quickly as possible, those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women.	3.195284657324927
This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish.	2.936153403288823
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports, a series of details.	2.8824532389465536
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10.	2.5922362561962795
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe.	3.0531624609913495
A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder.	2.375305688194569
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	3.3677148026158
I am, however, optimistic.	7.812889625625686
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times.	2.2213055304982996
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right. Unless we achieve real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk.	2.8689795022508817
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself, but only a means towards improving services.	2.751734986047691
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services.	2.6686576679694944
B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain;	1.9968552989689223
I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values.	3.86097215983457
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market.	3.0420217489716794
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	3.4007061244560393
At a forthcoming review of these programmes, it ought to be established that the EU' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU.	2.955625925075148
In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position.	3.499113168023607
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	2.175956436194358
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year, 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more.	2.556642205794806
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires.	2.1847861080039506
Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).	1.4445952442750394
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.8384467724761684
It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide.	3.1731867838424623
I attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because I am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone; I refer, in short, to the multifunctionality of rural areas.	2.2927469216434404
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States' national accounting.	2.7978069987404828
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	3.0004346547704643
It regards tourism for senior citizens.	1.4659880145396955
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you.	3.0482827977673366
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	1.6807586782199522
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark.	3.20765826751159
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy.	2.430204112993933
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.	2.7844304924581427
There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.	2.7887501136858526
Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded.	3.679737649853178
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms.	2.44253929983161
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted.	2.7946174377362683
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	3.3538316496209917
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening.	1.8454935599431994
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House.	2.1009593827732527
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken.	2.192988799290952
However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	2.8176712374583244
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.	2.2575684419923716
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute.	3.7570995647045855
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	3.2280602487814343
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment.	2.0689995337089178
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	3.6526019578612967
Nowadays, taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming.	1.4885280278939095
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years.	2.3371290823060997
It is also true, however, that, since the signing of the Sharm el-Sheikh agreements, 39% of the territory of the West Bank has been handed over to the Palestinian National Authority, together with two thirds of the Gaza Strip and, more importantly, this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with, since, under the terms laid down in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Israeli Government has the right to delay that handover.	2.946670822753645
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead.	2.800233192502129
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions.	2.409512048317604
This is the challenge.	24.393760910526904
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance.	3.2178397071319993
It is already included now: "indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products".	3.724821211622487
Today, at the end of the 20th century, a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency.	3.730952454552716
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra.	3.787131806355956
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future.	3.08946067840646
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	2.3723404744293
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	1.8389063659397265
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment.	2.3341075301944985
In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields.	3.0870290226610013
It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence.	2.4149699827176696
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account.	3.256450911973436
Europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom, including freedom to use one' s own money for the purposes of one' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will, others who make demands and then, when the break is made, refuse even to discuss the terms of the break, despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally.	2.67412658673436
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	3.8489212717322236
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period.	2.8605241838087903
However, we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council, as referred to at Helsinki, was contested recently.	3.4210419911523866
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.20885043331848
We should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions, by protecting the Union' s financial system with a substantive and procedural European law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the Community' s economic life.	2.499744510039305
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties.	3.2291555836983736
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.	4.610981698903266
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign.	3.7647027068652656
What now needs to be done, and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the Commission and the Danish Government, and with other governments, is to find the best way forward, so that something which is decided at European level by all the Member States, and which constitutes a general framework, can also include workers posted to Denmark from other countries.	3.4541816067096693
Finally, the Commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high-level group, the Commission communication on enhancing tourism' s potential for employment and the corresponding Council conclusions.	3.497201280943167
The European Community' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector' s potential for growth and employment.	2.047964736244447
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system.	3.520036677762021
This sort of monopoly, which could lead, for example, to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs, should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 April 1998.	2.4910835082794938
And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow.	2.670040929201219
Amendments Nos 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer' s liability.	2.368527932503295
Sadly, only 7.2% of the projects requested receive funds.	3.1413261338775977
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States.	2.713877842949719
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making?	1.7528005535243196
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	2.7553973932158806
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	2.823970935516562
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds.	3.564342117149818
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice.	2.686720634660603
Are there any objections to this oral amendment?	2.0563129075472872
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable.	2.4307355602497522
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	1.8113985739312455
The population was not allowed any input.	1.5226279499478192
We have stopped counting the damage and destruction in natural habitats and mountain zones.	1.7658033026692654
But there is a common factor, a hard core, comprising unemployment, the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises, both commercial and other kinds.	2.57528104655686
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area.	2.1351431223978965
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence.	2.614457975748024
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	2.7311955399123256
The Portuguese Presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the Eurojust network, since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of Europol to be a matter for Eurojust, this option cannot be ruled out at present.	2.6009249533031644
It is the humane face of Europe...	3.5647083171776677
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	9.221421856888213
Which is why, unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees, all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans.	2.4004643023694374
As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means.	2.1001373913491515
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay, at the expense of the environment.	2.3483649362206687
80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region.	3.080628537063086
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are, of course, underpinned by a mantra of the kind which, in recent years, has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding, but pernicious.	2.623985827743563
Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important.	3.564632848094159
The virus harms cold-blooded animals.	1.3954631004873324
Rapid action is called for!	1.8357174561501597
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties.	2.517291572482355
Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems.	2.664052176222957
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	2.78694582805843
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice?	3.564411748961477
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	2.2588428316947406
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development, that is to say unit managers and more senior managers, have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised.	2.9589508164825373
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted.	3.640766689882362
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat.	4.490508358394894
I come from Munich, a very densely populated urban conglomeration, but we have the same problem there.	3.897964798442352
We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994.	2.476085994597636
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.	3.037058792439375
Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth.	2.576450245305515
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	3.3364027232947997
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.	3.467097877896125
That would not be a good thing.	5.516807037670652
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive.	3.6306193547424406
Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future.	2.2664951920845366
Question No 44 by (H-0020/00):	1.1672026996941478
Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union.	2.693718770567138
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion.	2.151890108633586
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	1.5196295549352936
However, it must be "europeanised" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.	4.634044583404691
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play, as their input in society is important in our view.	2.5627955938437568
I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	2.9313041375368223
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here.	3.695513179558065
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects.	1.9820583459881802
It is of course a prerequisite, however, that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability.	2.7195322449990775
We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for?	1.9639114355817529
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.	2.951914138177675
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America.	2.955482520229404
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki.	2.4854398946567464
After all, what is social justice if it is without full employment?	3.7409178612244123
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	2.945281739909142
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed.	3.473953029427996
It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery.	2.5001881248196107
Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days.	2.9040678613018738
Given Poland' s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing.	2.2509428644641205
We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice.	2.797855995106274
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided.	3.007474985047904
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	3.701322480468672
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification.	2.546003602683949
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union.	2.1564015086574577
Mr President, I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues, mainly in the committees on transport and the environment, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry.	3.207013731537205
The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret.	3.4770209342140883
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry!	3.046385394535683
Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.	2.4691656318761677
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	2.2427852296522004
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	1.9525434119609981
In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service.	3.2580907255805194
Mr President, Commissioner, besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment, they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the European Union' s existence.	3.794103495521198
In any event, we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals, having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States.	2.6063853111312194
Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped.	2.1479356968347267
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	3.764447465427735
I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today.	4.133730659099203
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems.	1.7515478118504137
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.	3.8167401685077014
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.	2.5848667046045204
We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter.	3.414722177511323
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity. This programme must work at full capacity.	1.986830939004783
Cosmetic, medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous.	2.013919899660294
Accessible higher education, with which you have a certain affinity, is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups. I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam.	3.077248716304664
In common with Mrs McCarthy, I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced.	3.725896399624548
The first question, then, is about who should pay.	3.185465542279246
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission.	4.865907449201568
But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality.	2.902119987323057
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	2.6244482363273423
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation, this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations.	2.262383210867732
The pattern of intimidation is clear.	1.6944516738784774
Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events.	3.789407987209886
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations, although, I believe, these talks will not be held up indefinitely.	2.6654413621424986
At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity.	2.2776657639122733
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on.	2.2078267061622925
The Community' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars, which contradict the spirit of European unity.	2.9115761309674877
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	2.346603467952888
Mr Prodi talks solely of 'mechanisms' and 'structures' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people.	2.511989704377145
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns, as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past.	1.89949400427791
In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution.	3.6710069475418856
Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers?	5.0668427272884875
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons.	2.239750708152077
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.	2.4910868095430634
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time, if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees.	2.328505879451256
Mr President, everyone who has travelled here by car, train or aeroplane, has been able to see the extent of the damage, particularly in France, caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck Europe at the end of last month.	3.1921591203506585
It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties.	3.2337187122534004
Third, standards in European public life must be upheld.	1.668953586858902
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials.	2.1439602155177586
We consider the English version to be the original text.	3.677873155974183
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	3.375039413562742
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context.	2.9216562067792005
Is this possible?	1.5970117183691233
I will mention two point that may create tension.	1.7618260532792966
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	3.209667662070645
VOTE	21.75018985665072
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means, however slight, must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance.	2.838634335179989
Every year, I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund, that they are far behind in spending the funds.	4.046067133055492
There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority.	3.1658077298932947
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation?	1.4683383964932597
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up.	2.8349900409117845
Parliament has frequently made that point.	1.690944539977174
All the same, a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income, if not on profits, or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025.	2.6675895651335666
My vote was "in favour" .	1.4167243452699048
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject.	3.029511956066373
Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new.	3.3250532625069242
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	2.110595669094996
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses.	1.7776844564660856
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
I say now, as I have said on numerous occasions in the past: yes, I too would like the Commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this House, but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs.	3.3922772398179415
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer?	3.4484266906759533
Secondly, the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and training.	2.3156684137029386
We are now four months down the line.	2.625776346112073
The United Nation' s, and Mr Kouchner' s, mission in Kosovo ended in failure.	1.9279003450419778
It is in this respect that this House has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the Council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments.	3.1394526179046527
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform.	2.319249498772892
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation.	5.217772334466388
Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how.	3.613496059340798
I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed.	3.1785439200540573
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union.	4.055366306659339
The purpose of the Commission's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists.	4.373544466751237
I therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and I think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile.	3.098818634130594
Where I cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which, as you know, is not included in the articles of the Treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the Treaty.	3.104167525068934
Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem.	6.000701291286707
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States.	2.696153837839439
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	2.381409618040505
In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring.	3.343256459642086
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, 'Shaping the new Europe' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all.	3.5564558230324566
Mr President, the European Union' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began.	3.595851380730773
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	2.16974149060181
No living organisms, from microbes to otters, have been spared.	4.2451040204881805
The after-shocks can still be felt.	2.1703588024801626
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward. We will not find the guilty parties in this House or in many other places.	3.141768299551002
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the European Union and helps the more or less disadvantaged, island and remote areas to stand on their own feet.	2.5759099699250565
The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing.	3.0978308695167804
Yet, all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies.	1.9456538886990309
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead.	4.4435043443967865
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	2.4989738734760985
In the months I have been Commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system, I can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve, that is, the translation of policy into legislation.	3.1176526811175367
As far as excessive paper is concerned, the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan.	3.4999041138897815
The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities.	2.459247948844525
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect.	1.948929483740642
I respect Parliament' s wish, as it has been expressed, but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question, even by the European Parliament.	3.80625938701079
If we have success in this threefold sense, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens, will believe more in Europe, and this seems to me to be very important because, ultimately, the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in European life.	2.970608967540641
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency.	2.0151639536713426
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order, but I understand his political meaning.	3.4866317170588683
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East.	2.505552694224367
That foundation is clearly the single market.	2.172796408843729
Accordingly, the Commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market, based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines.	2.6874987812250533
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	3.2336182009707635
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	2.5538129623252703
The issue is as topical as it was before.	2.986701706914557
Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life.	2.7973489221592023
Whatever the Eurosceptics say, it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters.	2.776980151908535
Mr President, it is pleasing that, despite certain delays and problems, the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria.	2.699299895888777
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	2.633134101198098
Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year.	2.473007841488539
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken.	2.059594978289976
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders.	3.969156929680237
It is quite obvious to me, as someone who specialises in development policy, that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations.	3.2658184302223345
Of course, the final trade-offs will be made, as in any institutional negotiations, and I think this is no bad thing, at Council level, especially at the level of the Council of Heads of State and Government, who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands.	3.3448593492230803
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open, European-style, pluralistic democratic society.	2.1719505425280534
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate.	3.504737877640373
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	2.4679191958992277
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	2.192615670543438
Without presuming to lecture you - God forbid - or even advise you, may I just point out that, when it was my honour to be Minister for European Affairs in my own country, I saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people? Each week, when engaging in this dialogue in each region, I realised that there was a real need for the European Union to have a face.	3.072974237452546
This should first of all stand for better service.	2.6924829864008037
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	2.012137980217715
That would be more productive and I do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already overloaded being cut again and again because of this kind of show-piece.	2.9259695594387494
Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life.	2.6319665722195196
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices.	2.8639801938063374
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	2.0714312644652155
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.	2.505379828870716
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security, freedom and justice.	2.338278710689494
This cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions, which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy, transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	2.709868393932422
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift.	4.362813911255205
Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve.	3.636896769986966
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives.	3.0312708046990426
However, it has now achieved notoriety.	5.018179128024456
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	1.4041399743498872
Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen.	3.8796551908085446
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	2.813862774971114
My apologies once again for my mistake.	1.5557905431674852
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	2.7523716023476013
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	1.7872887929203303
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as "Equal" and "Urban" will be operating.	3.374235241256272
This has, from the outset, been the position of the Portuguese Presidency.	3.598974345739402
I would suggest that there is a solution.	5.063549741521976
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	2.1810445394672255
It is just a question of how.	6.6591865464157936
Finally, we would urge Members to vote in particular against Amendment No 41 on capital requirements, because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry.	3.83901836657528
Subject: Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb.	2.0206587317710247
At the same time, it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms, and a logical and vital step in the development of the Union, in the wake of the establishment of the internal market, the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy.	3.352066371751018
Corrie report (A5-0032/2000)	1.0820706359717611
In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination.	3.151957765181185
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected.	2.7322959904727506
If the latter do not have the required professional competence, then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority.	2.384413230261133
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	2.410165457256817
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment, Margot Wallström, has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself, on the spot, what has happened.	3.4910565134022415
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too.	2.9713420702564
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration.	2.7005595972424197
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	2.83264212644354
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them.	3.2304719007857567
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	2.342523210005688
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	2.848356558349886
I therefore support the Commission' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation.	3.142305897394642
Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress.	2.279796888831134
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees.	2.4713726170793926
Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.	2.909763487730653
Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door.	2.2349880695926974
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999.	1.991709713144995
We have tried to drive this proposal through.	1.8857958969634807
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	2.30285044969206
Of course, this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear.	2.6820676991792465
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore.	1.8124855115461669
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	3.1435998679862633
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again.	3.073911098123121
It may be supposed, for example, as Commissioner Bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 September last year, that the Commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 grams and two and a half times the basic tariff.	2.63377965399197
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years, and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon.	3.725974714665664
(Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9	2.5342710930530252
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	3.5299509716237667
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability.	2.1607067523690144
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority.	2.3369648086175947
This House is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating. You must therefore listen to our opinions, one or two of which I wish to express in my brief speech.	2.443489606894145
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries.	2.3399118063337467
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress.	3.2637304411889754
May I say something about costs.	2.7113835532767667
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny.	2.2977386030278204
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	2.255454855013018
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high, and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market.	2.2245899123147237
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.	2.1323960469404994
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	2.482555775288046
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report?	3.6529681932239835
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer.	1.8329292831298565
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment	1.225166648634295
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first 'environmental' disaster, Minamata disease, occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury.	2.903925504295126
But we do reserve the right, when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation, to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out.	2.781312512874372
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities.	1.83669343228671
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	2.7450545138167737
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application.	3.359003609195163
One reason for the acceptance of this proposal, and of the campaigns by NGOs such as ATTAC, SOLIDAR or others which have popularised this proposal, is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries, in areas such as education or health.	3.1505786584147843
In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place.	2.9075095670417337
Consequently, neither the Council, the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State.	3.886415465287921
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	4.791784357121738
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country, but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom.	2.9708430925744227
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs), I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report, and I have therefore voted in favour of it.	3.4198637709709057
I am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react, identify issues before they become crises.	1.9769853129584523
As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources.	2.972733918722502
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking.	2.3157944983703787
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	4.301605629906425
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	3.7279594275042576
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems.	2.625049069469574
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now.	4.904165587480454
Consumers see their standard of living being eroded, poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the Union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition, in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business.	2.8277601088523645
One could do so once or twice, but I feel that the UN donors should contribute to this as well, for there is a very large hole, as yet unfilled, that we are unable to fill.	3.432425817780871
Mr President, today' s debate comes under the sign of the snail, not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress.	2.3920365228334495
Today, if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers, we should be doing ourselves dishonour.	2.5900687284106847
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	3.3633549597480252
In this way, LEADER+ can, together with the programmes under Regulation (EC) No 1257/99, consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside.	2.5056602534023713
That is where we really get into difficulty.	2.1362122977707894
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested.	3.5623602469169438
There has to be a willingness to cooperate.	5.020246323970903
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another.	3.1255668152798353
Madam President, I would like, with reference to this report, to underline the problem of translation: reference should be made to the French or Italian version, since the text adopted by this Parliament will also be the authoritative one for the Commission.	3.716627262679062
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves.	2.479319172230336
Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question.	3.314481076621546
Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff.	3.5697382364523023
Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.	2.417205039097143
It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions.	3.438325949015111
Such transactions, according to the argument, bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables. This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir.	2.2724585393696186
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
So a great deal has to be done in this area.	5.123175272870278
Furthermore, 90% of businesses active in tourism are small or medium-sized, the very enterprises which form the living cells of our social and economic tissue, which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development.	2.7559091162987426
The Minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by Parliament at the beginning of the next part-session.	3.302264017198378
On the other hand, the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants, and the people that will not benefit from the new services.	3.9012686307802995
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	4.375133882459238
The cast is always the same.	2.2854857097401773
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic.	1.6461079923812008
We must create a cross-border culture, and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation, imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each Member State, in each region and each municipality.	2.7731666747633312
For me as a Finn, and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals, it is most important that those EU states where TSEs do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals.	2.8087236010311782
Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved.	3.8952625978857847
- (FR) The vote which has just taken place in this Chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our Member States with such anxiety.	3.192125507812954
However, these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared.	1.7607081993023386
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world.	3.791412700322182
Mr President, behind the report, which is an honest one, by Mrs Attwooll, which we shall vote for, we see the European fisheries policy. It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea, which is immense and without borders, it is not easy to manage fish on the move.	3.5172400129712886
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this.	3.35884893056411
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and, if I may say so, if ever there was a case where that is relevant, it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique.	3.0818262580110827
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	3.6648587572336937
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects.	2.769844222743026
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	3.759176570806979
We therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings, and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the Commission' s initiative.	2.837860215486619
Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003.	3.0402494183732807
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.	2.0633138608318644
Commissioner, I am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and I hope that, in this sense, we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit.	3.4961265246864723
Madam President, I should like to tell Mr Wurtz that the Commission' s doctrine is not the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty and that, until proved otherwise, we are not in the situation where Articles 6 and 7 would be applicable.	3.718053652365333
While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion.	2.9552914794427103
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue.	2.5917019704861217
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	2.3297017827961275
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues.	2.7898898259342335
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due.	2.431325793086122
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years.	3.0450056944253383
They are still in training, as it were.	3.6863080194592066
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply.	2.7334756309171246
We hope that this, at the least, will come about during the evaluation process.	3.203452894911627
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time.	2.9634759355747677
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation.	1.4471100917572237
The European Council in Helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions, and I believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which, as I said at the beginning of my first speech, represent a window of opportunity.	2.8575249644450533
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation.	2.800109544214551
Nowadays, let us face it, the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington.	2.8392163575708813
This new move follows on from the step taken at the Helsinki European Council last December, when it was decided that Malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in February 2000, i.e. by the end of this month, in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the Union and the adjustments required.	2.6147092803488152
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all!	2.3873404984615547
The INTERREG Community Initiative Programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of European territory, most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the European Union and its outlying regions.	3.1510937961722956
It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures.	2.340143405512522
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality.	2.5049742283829692
We would like to thank the President of the Republic, as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too, in this House, would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs.	3.3371849140710803
Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg.	2.8507279966970294
This is also the case for the so-called statutory government which is just as guilty, because if this journalist has accused the President himself of deriving benefit from this civil war, then all he is doing is voicing what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across Africa.	2.2293790254131536
It is, after all, a matter of civilisation, progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community.	2.8446716348701147
As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards.	2.4201481530782396
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support.	3.2451803687291463
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	3.1317911426111373
Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries.	3.042156141192742
Let us contemplate this result, derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy.	1.560594222217225
We think that the task we now have of establishing a European agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market, to stabilise confidence in this market, to break down some of the tensions between Member States in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the European Union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety.	3.263858824981055
We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services.	2.345809984377579
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.	2.6684549755485563
We are not, fortunately, at this point.	4.627349744262751
(Applause from the PSE Group)	2.2516470636649086
I will give some examples shortly.	2.676911841584595
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.	2.4639934075853906
For a long time, many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures, when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments, particularly for humanitarian intervention.	2.4803691787597795
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy.	3.5614676737052764
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	2.7875148233207465
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	4.003383439755551
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	2.665213655215524
Secondly, speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify.	2.0104110187511295
The EU must not take on a masculine persona.	2.5794195349750124
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice.	3.499789271241948
This is a creative initiative, which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in European politics, but the Commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue.	3.019330158720289
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	3.3901183495917318
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment.	2.871886777014797
Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version?	3.2333293609034612
Let me turn to some of the more important points.	3.9796395420363315
The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	3.0422125814938705
That service will open on 1 May this year.	1.9513846063616984
You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice.	4.1126996788751855
In fact, we were shaken by it.	3.940275024219725
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements.	2.620469723186336
Obviously, the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria.	2.801935199517408
We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident.	2.220450620596973
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy.	2.558374137410362
When talking about climate change, we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.	3.411590811760752
We want to encourage debate among the people.	3.201390532844615
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43.	4.042055667502131
Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate.	3.09927302297755
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	2.5382057508760902
Mr Corbett set out Parliament' s concerns.	1.426061769169815
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	3.725721556762215
It would be very difficult for those who propose a 'yes' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the Irish people if we lose our right to have our nominee to the European Commission.	2.8299160343910965
The Commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention, so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area, and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the Community for this purpose.	3.120550290775764
It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations.	2.690651898338014
Have the lessons not been learnt?	1.5866057584567634
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2.	3.133536810954849
Report by Olle Schmidt (A5-0025/2000)	1.2512279989760595
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.	3.4549478242648255
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation.	3.4850100200286542
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role, that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process.	3.683830440458288
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed, certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000.	2.442349756467618
Mr President, Commissioner, it is because of my experience in the Balkans, when I was there on duty, that I call on you today to support the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in Cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the United Nations.	3.08549188944731
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table.	4.039730873487862
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the Council, and in the end, makes it rather irrelevant.	3.666799539004937
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction, it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards.	2.2993140583833993
As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities.	2.9970616708810303
In all such cases, however, strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained.	2.9777673219027934
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	3.2280568540855397
And, finally, the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified. Regarding this, too, there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission.	3.1476789961404124
Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.	3.3829731482787286
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	2.4271885650221874
We have submitted an amendment to this effect.	2.6857174659971816
We should be careful about this.	4.448116224018319
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.	2.212349600054965
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.	2.431686922847838
Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO?	2.579009032871174
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999.	2.417458314405347
Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting.	5.336497044053216
I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this.	2.627974915727692
It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned.	2.68026089020971
I should, however, like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions.	2.7888374593745002
Now it is, of course, possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the Member States and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.	3.4263068332050515
Finally, there is currently still no European urban policy within the European Union. Perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the Intergovernmental Conference so that the European Union finally has a true urban policy.	3.0673686417128527
No-one would benefit from this situation.	2.18444171468936
Its argument was one of priority.	2.2815862196103267
In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one.	2.6120272678884064
European taxpayers need to be re-assured.	5.5001518597988985
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	2.5428755723927363
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent.	1.7550092058299807
Mr Dupuis, first of all I attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word 'citizen' .	2.33837792743856
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report.	2.1688032267128645
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are, of course, basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised.	3.1639120856962415
This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing.	3.8680337356642926
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	2.1107502882418383
More specifically, the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards, which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach, need to be maximised.	3.4044321503770445
There, it is mainstreaming which applies.	4.203052578533451
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy.	2.752761719547619
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	3.782092222779893
The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.	3.1784933140761837
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough.	1.9884357619260338
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves.	3.573556814940721
Personally, however, I shall continue to fight against the extreme right, to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of Austria, and to organise a major public demonstration in Lille on Saturday at 3 p.m.	2.883563349912948
Since June of last year, the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities.	1.8241615522965466
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns.	3.8011263278187366
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform.	2.5086393429125033
The people of Angola deserve better.	3.3900707635964924
. Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development.	2.8780637718739275
The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself.	3.40880065089665
This is an arduous task.	6.025073058988611
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.6634238620972148
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	2.675983364470995
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented, and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence.	2.3183897726082483
- (IT) On behalf of the Italian Communists, I would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document, which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for Europe up until the year 2005.	2.813639286472018
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet, at Sète or elsewhere, for example, if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed, while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it.	2.072468175223241
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities, who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops.	3.1862350516662614
Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration.	2.7341149251624066
It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present, which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister, Giorgios Papandreou, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Ismail Cem.	3.2813356038748642
In more direct terms, to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams, this would contravene the Treaty of Rome.	2.2782676336303807
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government.	2.3213503303325447
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.	2.349561813604771
I sincerely hope that, particularly during the French presidency later this year, the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options, and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament.	3.405379097493073
They were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them.	1.8040389481562953
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	3.0433751384304606
As far as criminal sanctions are concerned, measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the European Parliament.	3.288276236452648
Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that "the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter.	2.5664034001994636
Are we ready to pay for those resources?	2.2525066693247147
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	2.6523529640030623
You will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of, that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials, that 85% of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92% of all cars in the Netherlands are recycled.	2.438761300289951
When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.	1.7100430859735385
This lesson in wisdom is 100% ideology and 0% knowledge.	1.4600185622985027
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	3.5460898266884002
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace.	1.6358141639708315
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	3.7561991847597462
It is now a fact that in order to attain this goal, rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs, which are no longer solely connected with agriculture, in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also, for instance, in rural tourism, sport and cultural activities, environmental projects, SMEs, services, and so on.	3.237260347842162
If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable.	3.26886223452022
I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home.	2.8355992367559466
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work, and we should recognise that.	2.4790489511532896
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	3.456214242636808
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts.	3.5580438344920324
Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS))	2.295564309681004
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region.	3.34874429318652
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening?	3.110562707938896
I now come to the content of the report.	3.2443072135448787
This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.	4.6296219272190084
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.	2.2019341478231294
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls.	3.7812283084504066
I am glad to say to Mr van Hulten and Mr Haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment, training, appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals.	2.5551444699492656
It is an excellent report.	4.911788785006111
The proposed change will make the systems more effective, both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes.	3.1284286829621077
In other words, our rapporteur is proposing an oral amendment to add a recital reading: 'Whereas Malta and Cyprus will participate...'	2.3652040015879376
I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President.	2.5134868311578735
There is a need for more coordination, more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided.	2.599915797793321
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom.	2.316068470028965
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition; a new, reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office.	2.3118300768571425
That is not always the case.	4.03023884350958
And when that day comes, it is too late.	3.6478948989411095
This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market.	2.9882235389938074
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region, or in a 5b region?	2.4581639047427375
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.	3.1836494765298156
On the other hand, we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find (a) materials that are easier to recycle and (b) to set up recycling industries.	2.9261306791425863
Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.	2.5224927972171347
When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators.	2.7134660129989143
I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state' s tax revenue.	2.570685648851954
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	2.89372514806533
This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it.	3.0488020178892286
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious.	4.3865949303372105
Of course we need to modernise these systems.	4.170559356822706
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee.	3.560487030674947
Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity.	3.0932089418988133
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems.	2.019586935062268
As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives.	3.3458620163879904
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.	3.4717775215205586
However, it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern.	6.7013317597242015
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East.	2.102022238525346
Furthermore, future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States, for example the food safety authority in Ireland.	2.870813743764894
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety, for example, are nonsense.	3.223415082579592
Counterfeiting is not on the list.	1.8569971518652866
Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme.	3.9560627234039756
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety.	3.6927435607841144
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future.	2.5224100677955117
Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts.	2.9163570338897045
However, I would like to concentrate on two points.	4.293446108367312
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	2.0274064442385806
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework.	2.4699829816653875
Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive.	7.293586447844078
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example.	2.895061055383319
Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe.	4.284220800289069
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children.	1.9457798547484282
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms, no sanitation, no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water.	1.7110205005017622
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?	1.674469313511418
- (SV) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing, to say the least.	2.277162955788871
This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27.	3.47885603651788
First of all, I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility, Mr Posselt.	2.8748827338529868
However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council.	3.820427918565729
I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them.	2.0244776635280046
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	3.0153062523955376
I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement.	1.9657323984525639
Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS))	2.4656893391468784
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question.	2.2064985257187573
No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms.	2.1583180564083193
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	4.0327987486210874
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997.	2.5226851672575803
Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example.	3.0227221860980076
This is why, Madam President, I should like to see Mr Prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words, so that nobody, absolutely nobody, can use this message, which is unusual and unwise, to say the least, to contribute, and that includes counter to the intentions of Mr Prodi, towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in Austria a commonplace.	2.74321632377587
It is the Tisza, Hungary' s second river, perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people, that has borne the brunt.	2.3379711753721413
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.	3.085856499042144
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	2.5631613116781113
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	2.4541970140962373
It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious.	3.6803874018238183
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	4.6698128252629365
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters.	3.5348278165430482
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe.	2.327914602454543
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	4.807364351371169
That cannot continue.	1.8403732554779835
I will end by congratulating Mr Viceconte and, as one who comes from Crete, a tourist area, I ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a Europe which needs those jobs.	3.0841377296064243
There must be an overriding economic interest.	3.1025355195626676
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	4.0112468048628545
For that reason, I approved these measures, but I should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water purity at the point where it enters our houses, to ensure that it is of the highest level.	3.668506940943252
The first is greater transparency.	5.2186644895667165
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.	5.258782060208059
Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures.	4.317423366437126
Mr President, I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development.	2.866338633713061
It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister' s treasury funds.	2.674138290337503
Even by this stage, that is already too many by far.	3.375549534520779
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	2.940738951805179
It is concerned with increased integration which, as part of a duplicitous package, involves increased repression and control.	2.7458483102177556
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned, we shall abstain from voting, and where, finally, the motion for a resolution is concerned, we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it.	3.3063915401705297
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard.	2.4040971725487554
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis' s report on fisheries and the environment. The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow.	2.4726658348265733
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid, so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date.	2.7266498019484713
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result.	3.369382327887486
Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon.	4.599189120230707
Although I am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation, having access to EQUAL, I would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees.	2.998118564069179
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it?	2.7401636131626175
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework.	4.153053369190958
However, things are really quite different.	1.668487536563861
You see, the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport, its reduced cost, and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe.	2.129484120909358
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict.	2.131715865924077
But we have enough agreements now: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm el-Sheikh.	1.9236251834200082
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation.	2.1358127945189445
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	2.8070694688599
As the President of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano, remarked in a dramatic appeal, each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans.	2.3157829439679514
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence, mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service.	1.9507548702930888
Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	4.8338727773188745
By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III.	2.95324661011732
It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences.	2.2831038614940327
The nations, regions, towns and communities of Europe will be preserved.	2.239724331791456
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	2.4911957356108925
It must form the basis for our partners' political will.	2.781743716349437
To answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination, I will say that the initiative states clearly that the Member States must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination.	2.8629025031522803
As far as the citizens are concerned, it is what a regulation can do for them that matters.	4.242622507964974
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence.	2.1936563460980762
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	2.8156486227221325
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	2.9896112912054082
In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental.	2.2526573030197694
We need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Europe as well.	2.8584055814786993
This particularly applies, however, to our own coastal waters.	3.8056659134665063
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought.	2.1476254429306705
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	2.6221666255126803
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.531277521076661
	32.62528478497609
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	1.541729250604385
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	2.123079111503236
What is the basis of armed action?	5.8256943759674
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States.	2.878082536575872
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all, however.	3.6040982668482933
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view.	2.669348475791834
I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries.	2.695820020770956
We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is "Less is sometimes more!"	2.4893167191844237
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that: "It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility".	1.9447413173222763
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens.	2.88065571671638
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities, the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports.	2.632862080417246
Thank you very much Commissioner.	3.8106819568220223
Madam President, despite the protests by the international press, we still do not know the fate of Mr Andrey Babitsky, the courageous Russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of Chechnya and the destruction of the city of Grozny.	2.3296587678279885
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction.	2.879805836239634
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix.	4.34272710496933
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	3.17704175738217
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour.	3.0287261602120514
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	4.994443869310144
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions, such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected.	3.513056427903019
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments.	3.094626244809921
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups.	3.096186530600654
I believe that at the present stage in the European Union' s development, it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at European Union level in a charter, so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens.	3.4635999661828683
Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro?	3.7554178703446564
Mr President, I would very much just like to add to two particular points.	3.9063451995783947
Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact.	4.350110061556818
That is important, for at least three reasons.	3.1324745665676836
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions.	3.658790459190128
I am not going to say much more on these issues.	3.443908329526415
As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings.	3.629887030080705
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards.	2.6564019011275852
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	2.4607973950289797
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	3.0401119315730476
The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations.	3.1353955578455617
In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament.	2.531969846235846
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.	3.3514937226584767
However, on a general level, I would say that in all cases it is the Structural Funds expenditure which must be additional. This is how, provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected.	3.4268578907961653
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.	1.8073862791226798
I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources.	3.5331715082926283
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	2.4765721061611417
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation.	2.5337520173291925
Anyone, whether European or not, who lives and works in Andalusia, is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect. The EU can and must speak out.	2.287886593800254
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.	3.711106013395501
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come, because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour!	2.7267229758069123
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy.	3.1540315621271193
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000.	2.622145038666824
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives.	3.531135596362178
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?	4.707353553297087
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them.	2.337716886417556
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites!	2.5990418456722635
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line.	1.7377066547713722
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.	2.6502998472758112
With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes.	2.3795715754709783
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion.	2.9355004700248077
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation, where almost none exists.	2.9419356941555876
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	3.1227127749447336
Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary.	3.3065352471476914
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world.	2.1600422164639044
Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so.	3.038362013557701
The possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place, but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation, would be a step we should take in tandem with the European Commission, rather than saying that it is a matter for the Council.	3.902299518298797
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be.	3.4362549528512556
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.312020837056213
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.	3.062366462859698
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance.	2.0209471346290506
How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you?	2.4091082664711596
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	2.5816626559534313
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet?	2.893024514870168
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive, the so-called Article on Delegation, I think the Commission' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee, so I would support some of Mrs Villiers' amendments to this point.	3.497339712083368
A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence.	2.3932798555275503
Everyone recognises, indeed this was the theme of today' s debate, that, if the European Union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level, it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development-related policies. I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council, for the Commission or for Parliament alone.	3.491887498850024
There is more to be said on that score.	2.966483890466384
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause, even in extremely minimal quantities, changes in the gender of animals and even humans, as is more and more being ascertained by scientists.	2.5281046019086375
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.	2.4751691754595098
They see us restricting each other's liberties.	1.6702375456495906
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	2.3218472986475063
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment.	2.88995660077688
This can only benefit our credibility.	2.58466945950685
We are to know who is on each committee.	3.0846200213521575
Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies.	2.897318441707802
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately.	1.9640653160610844
I would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time, and this delay is going to limit the time available for Questions to the Commission.	3.0232184152337385
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met.	1.878661434642643
It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects.	2.2944965289762504
Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility.	3.5345744945825466
I would like to remind you, however, that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared, the fifth programme for equality between men and women.	2.843631756682066
One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality.	3.015317721968896
Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.	2.3045420955689733
Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago.	2.1990481661463743
Congratulations!	48.116547780453246
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism.	1.3178059537669846
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region.	2.693290478643214
In recent times, Africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help, but nothing tangible has yet been achieved. In recent years in Africa, we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy, but quite the contrary - a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes.	2.089782831683419
We therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of Bolshevism or Nazism. Democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong, but also listening to their explanations.	2.0236967070202088
Ireland, for generations, sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world, but now when the Celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations, we are showing a very ugly side to our character. Racism in Ireland is endemic.	2.09332589939629
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, after all, in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO.	2.1240826066595235
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	2.8082113896418326
We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights.	2.377774713159333
However, that is not the problem.	11.579181275540652
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.	2.7815611688348976
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	4.011476829480629
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	3.126549125399009
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon.	1.7629509646963828
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	2.3763370738829566
We congratulate you.	1.655111308974602
Finally, I would like to mention technical assistance.	3.9845227962733936
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead.	2.4487725396476177
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive, which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously.	2.7534167919428256
It is difficult to understand, and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again.	3.530942273123684
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy.	1.6496591018279418
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision.	2.0954772822684773
It has to be redistributed time and again.	3.23214482982887
All who are in contact with real life in Kosovo share the same opinion: it is a tragic, desperate situation where there is a democratic void and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side. Mitrovica is a tragic example of this.	2.5860822223450977
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	3.9326015482108003
In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition.	3.126993546688518
The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures.	2.935774348342754
In this respect, the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions.	2.21488596237246
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties.	2.5517430319859233
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society.	1.454899115344807
Madam President, whoever has the honour, like myself, to chair the Committee on Culture, cannot fail to agree with the comments from various Members and can but congratulate the rapporteur, and Commissioner Reding, with whom he worked and who, even during the conciliation process, had difficult moments and opposed the Council - you have heard this said by everyone.	2.515602906335613
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that.	1.7560983960212508
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	2.934790850210994
The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years.	2.4794320472012648
However, there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south, specifically Amendment No 43 which, with regard to the recuperation of costs, also indicates that Member States must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making.	3.5660104271459625
What should this global actor' s objective be?	1.5137187830771013
I think that it is quite obvious, and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the Erika disaster, that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport.	2.93195983392514
Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle.	1.8069331670644182
However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources.	3.6737164072962036
If I may, however, just make a few comments on the method.	3.897730367660175
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes.	2.3677677033445548
Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	3.477242535611884
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	3.4744467881078016
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	3.1742668315037856
On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction.	4.195680703957248
It is impacting on the war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and on the situations in Namibia and Zambia. It is now also affecting the situation in Zimbabwe where Robert Mugabe has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the Congo to prop up Laurent Kabila who is beyond salvation.	2.234556733564373
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	1.8497772474177323
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge, the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned, in this case in the course of 1997.	2.872129203712556
Instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as Lloyds of London, we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than 10% of the lost oil.	2.87184534785178
I believe that the fact that Culture and, fittingly, Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner' s remit, will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes, which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union.	3.2111670031050523
You are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials. The Member States, local authorities and NGOs will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above, all on an equal footing in their submission to Brussels.	2.1850783935149782
As far as we are concerned, they will be.	6.255586837230896
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action.	3.450313203252211
However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people.	4.4901574332107295
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament, in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised.	4.698452572935626
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	3.2933067656676887
The answer to this is that we know very little about this.	3.8868059795641052
My group will not be supporting those amendments.	3.550019547869553
We, the social democrats, would urge the opposition to back these ideas.	2.816394053246538
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	3.5642888917926454
These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote.	2.2691159014365825
Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet.	2.2689779206289384
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture.	3.085393362344433
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence.	2.4653479200307555
Firstly, when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal.	2.4395608926172336
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies.	3.3144719952416706
This is why it has been around for years, and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response.	3.9893785879237456
I have two or three points to make in this respect.	3.0007229148253245
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities.	3.473264041379569
Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union.	2.417416026816156
Subject: Amount which Andalusia will receive from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period According to the Commission' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the Berlin Summit (which include per capita GDP, the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants), what amount is to be allocated to Andalusia from the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period?	2.817008592011158
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up.	2.5500590902536753
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over.	2.910232461429171
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108.	2.4132742174726163
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	2.7584552025209312
It provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration, protect ecosystems, promote sustainable water use, help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	1.9726206943882918
Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence.	3.507319416641514
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating, as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity, to want anything else.	2.841723321879855
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)	1.7704252543601033
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture.	2.734705599699783
Firstly, Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents.	2.2446342331952964
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education.	1.9218307448652874
What we are doing here is not hypocritical.	3.0411468417155945
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates.	3.17340740117457
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report.	3.3917506422021964
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	2.3084050278897545
Because it is political it is more complex.	3.7097136701693536
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper.	2.2239235232617878
..., with all the rights and commitments that this entails!	2.99257900290155
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	3.8180044169391394
The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy.	2.9907230445593895
We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular.	2.3769566997903757
Nevertheless, I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points.	3.5117619249921224
In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected.	3.3356799233468286
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament' s opinion is.	3.9797004006418124
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.	3.1369458066782006
I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here.	2.8841488742910504
They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.	2.221499588832218
You are most welcome.	1.5741638602885561
In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties.	3.109796332788788
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect.	4.225123511230465
As the rapporteur said, this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value.	2.2116662245282934
The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of.	2.6552175854678426
In the measures that have been adopted, I note that support for people who purify their water in their own homes has been omitted. I trust that this will be remedied in the future.	2.8354940465904885
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.	2.400755681032683
Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of 'non-refoulement' [no turning back].	2.4949718692826073
From our point of view, it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament.	2.4050203029902675
We must continue to keep inflation under control, proceed with liberalisation, ensure more competition, encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies; push forward with science, and push back scientific boundaries, and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science.	1.894514343863841
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?	1.9029516831480953
With these forecasts of the structural policy - which I know very well - and the forecasts of LEADER and rural development, we will not promote, as we should, employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions.	3.221681866464903
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO.	3.099025075809685
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.	1.6398663385853045
Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies.	2.018634074860488
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals.	3.2210443207243054
Mr President, I am taking the floor to express my opinion, drawn from my experience of municipal administration, that the URBAN projects should, or rather must, have a threefold purpose: firstly, to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic, old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities.	2.970609213880949
A company is pilloried one day and not the next.	2.3086495082131555
They would then determine their own prices.	1.5883360966595839
The next item is the report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the implementation of the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 on comitology (1999/468/EC).	3.1604808431757943
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, your inspiring speech, Mr Prodi, has quite won me over.	2.956987853505698
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	1.6925036502858857
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	2.854719285444813
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves.	2.6285670080527894
Who will provide us with new jobs?	2.2741416909602616
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	5.0122669287487644
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement.	4.835075681791116
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	2.8039779628755963
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:	2.393513699083961
If nothing is done now, we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste.	3.5257376403855227
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	2.308369789812215
Senior citizens are always on holiday, all year round, from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year.	2.3498200550414303
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy.	3.383483355761852
I therefore wonder whether the Commission' s package on postal liberalisation will include the preservation of free competition, because it is very possible that - as has happened in most sectors in the Community today - it will lead to concentrations of large companies which will cancel out the benefits of this theoretical liberalisation.	2.9072994013077342
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.	3.7605560538094602
There are, however, one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific.	3.5824806010138044
Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric.	2.9948946852711256
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government.	2.1791147288031447
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together, and of course, it leads to peace and understanding.	3.2716790029978333
I presume, however, that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights, which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole.	2.752075058417569
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	3.859799332713116
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict.	2.3301848291051286
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials.	2.9729135363339756
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	3.1183435449819776
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person' s ethnic origin.	2.5379058287449294
Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed.	3.7582624255308956
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters, the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France.	3.0243110352203284
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	2.7213575884575762
But other countries, in other situations, may have alternative analyses.	3.0807888459025503
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament.	3.1806364827117046
. (IT) Mr President, the approval of this agreement with the Commission on procedures for implementing the Council decision on comitology marks the end of a saga which has kept Parliament busy for two years, along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the Union, whom many people do not hesitate to call masochists.	3.3490044450488554
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative.	3.0251797110378744
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)	1.643513965009969
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility.	3.329709272805774
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests.	3.185319782311527
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997?	2.736038825986424
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	3.4975948823534453
I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this.	3.007937687379537
Subsidiarity should make us realise that the state, exercising its governing functions, and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately. The state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people.	2.1761368160547487
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. we are heading for war.	2.204789662015235
I would therefore ask you, Mr Prodi, to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today.	3.779830098699815
If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement.	2.607500306322396
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents.	2.137475749008141
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.	2.780411894150333
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	3.1274644044723
Why would it not work elsewhere?	2.148709861965468
The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument.	3.877391319723462
In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant.	3.349480866751341
You have one minute each in which to ask your question.	2.005708744958511
Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth.	2.3230681938756845
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	1.6543901920395176
I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus.	2.616197539149934
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy: "Yes to Work" and "Back to Work" .	2.441629888628089
"Condemns Mr Haider for his insults towards certain EU Member States and their leaders in the last few days in statements, which Foreign Minister Schüssel has failed to condemn."	2.292833697323969
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	2.5286622384821866
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	2.4594344405275823
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers.	4.2094938149283845
It is very helpful.	7.367870969788847
As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June.	3.782054558802135
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region.	3.1961347918834835
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing.	2.0575768643553642
We must, some time soon, find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously.	2.2220261387972258
The fate of Andrey Babitsky, the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty, who was arrested by Russian troops, is a dramatic example of Russian policy.	2.0398276384579823
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	2.073551698574232
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	2.673807260974521
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company.	2.7489950106130503
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism, as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD.	2.0911043888372456
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne, a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you. What about the BSE test?	2.2238660398871746
.	77.3301660757284
In any case, it should be clear that my group, of course, fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men.	4.000853550995153
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	3.457559710344538
As far as this is concerned, the report, albeit a component, may well be the key component of Lisbon, because it is really innovative, while many other things are merely a rumination of what has been said before.	3.3952242749279598
Who is going to pay?	5.956160070180074
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta, starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years (2000-2004).	2.903363507981021
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations.	3.0372525711281115
Very well, I shall do so.	5.474473117174959
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions.	2.768869150479237
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question.	4.740054438210155
We need a public debate on this.	4.931237820982603
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself, but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues, the ones where it hurts!	2.27552528278037
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland.	2.511901063950326
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it.	2.3220102029604535
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.	1.985535945570913
There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive.	2.548256902912259
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason.	2.158002401116265
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.	2.8602161739032077
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture.	2.602381130849849
) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way.	3.3733571145248926
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	1.7244734926385372
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	2.487448112636302
A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time.	2.3590179554248794
I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus.	2.1866911142507073
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	2.5733101847022875
I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge.	3.4545537959362513
I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments.	3.776525305377474
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	1.7233950010714334
It must be seen to deliver.	6.140235384027359
We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back.	2.339402183211596
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten.	3.120955236797835
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	2.813599992770982
In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of "Ten Commandments" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points.	3.2633161911342636
I do not agree.	15.656750308860389
Unfortunately, however, it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions.	3.5945790157579607
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	2.7639381510002528
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself.	1.9333336125570497
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case.	1.980592546209734
Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland.	1.704068387433725
I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations.	3.115531964626513
Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent.	3.9653569346022857
(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)	1.6742717729415049
Thank you for your reply.	3.2912687552343085
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio' s action plan with open arms.	2.7283174615609687
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	3.381168282795321
This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers.	2.2260211615529366
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court.	4.808217516921597
Therefore, the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties.	3.4634379120076573
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries.	2.1963569378558
These amendments can all be approved.	1.9295694036264082
Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous.	2.499532626243868
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.	4.038665938937812
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	2.836760623859794
Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse.	2.3266060896443297
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail.	2.2951124204828446
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments.	3.6122341158052587
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention.	3.338384117511458
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice.	1.980274035815022
We all know the picture.	4.345690314188075
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors.	2.9493373757188253
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals.	2.703783223387168
Question No 42 by (H-0026/00):	1.1672026996941478
These are my three questions.	1.4873740509175846
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged.	4.421565361828322
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	3.2140189878556784
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.	3.0420890729055463
We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments.	3.031449013853719
It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland.	3.391276734364045
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent, Tajikistan.	2.132480877827489
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	4.180888509377715
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence.	5.371373887695025
Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that.	2.703202741153937
We must create joint, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social operators, play an active role.	2.8225340366757643
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway, that he preferred to get things right, but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting.	1.9889188281626071
I shall therefore, with your permission, give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion.	2.269678570490351
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive.	2.5767457228215584
Like honourable Members, I welcome the United States' efforts that have relaunched the Syrian/Israeli negotiations, despite the Syrian decision that they needed more time before resuming the talks that were scheduled to start again today.	2.5988914912953476
Mr President, in Kotka, in Finland, there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals, which is sailing under a flag of convenience.	4.312719110275222
It is obvious, however, that these countries, impoverished within a Communist economic system, cannot cope with a social policy like, for example, Sweden' s.	3.0371868419282615
Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state.	2.637498630868265
Employers would be lost without immigrants.	1.5772001058533214
And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us.	2.7963754507650167
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union.	2.345040877595856
It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority.	3.7728528174242872
.	77.3301660757284
For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty.	3.682659069835794
However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed.	3.06018867222182
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	1.850188793579678
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible.	4.262191688534298
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.	2.5932486602594955
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification.	2.0760424169392384
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	3.746790509442405
We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.0931388922561984
Allow me to start with the most important demand.	6.08351940786546
For five years, I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation, which assuredly does not have Parliament' s broad perspective.	3.7779972621577262
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored.	2.2477733594139497
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	2.1143610242395807
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	2.4803710439080207
Subject: Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament.	4.1309995904336105
Within my group, it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon.	2.648246438114894
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	2.2728880690545332
Mr President, co-operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market Europe, but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation: the fundamental human rights and freedoms, laid down in the European Convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.987663956595942
Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions.	3.2406404770549377
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	2.5964569650867575
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	4.925108746355415
But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well?	3.679270663112689
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars.	2.4390879088461688
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see.	4.114454405143632
An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter.	3.07603334537882
When it comes down to it, Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough.	3.6141941064957344
I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed.	2.4747539518402926
And yet, at the same time, we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines.	2.898686161695487
In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators.	2.8660558001406367
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training?	1.4760826426372067
Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far.	3.9811821504647495
Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time.	2.073751402228241
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	2.2097427251347663
It should seal their revival.	1.2724326425078787
The basic aim of the communication is twofold.	2.722476902678607
Madam President, I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that, during the conciliation procedure, I was personally a little disappointed with the Council.	3.6901997488474954
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome.	4.216658136123903
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament, mainly with a view to reaching a balance.	4.2089252673185165
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	2.9448399691990477
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	2.696383628920547
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.5070393138808864
The next item is the report (A5-0010/2000) by Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - SAVE (C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371(COD)).	2.013104016740145
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.	1.564894847260897
I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	4.062524997104598
Madam President, according to various Members of your Parliament, more funding should still be made available for major projects.	3.056246638749232
(Loud applause)	1.1492569002612767
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs, which is no way to set a shining example.	3.148027403380173
In theory, we could have done so.	3.4283985827498737
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it.	3.8143652761013196
Unfortunately, we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb, Romany, Turkish, and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next.	3.1450330086118656
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.	2.1622057228482503
It is therefore important that the manufacturer' s liability should be clear. This should not in any way be jeopardised.	3.1651622033591993
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on.	2.9157442820238435
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas.	1.7141532827048338
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	3.1116246096274933
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today.	3.6900970954601062
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	3.1733898555249263
The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy.	3.7999794289991606
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	2.8032905254517084
One example of this is the 'Celtic' area which encompasses the territories of Brittany in France, Cornwall and Devon in the United Kingdom and Cork and Waterford in Ireland. This is an area whose locally-based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri-foodstuffs sector.	3.6829435771612657
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%.	2.767286572753939
Then it is possible to understand that, for example, lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to European competition policy, and Brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are, of course, bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context.	2.925388181443285
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	2.3028072438613094
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	2.371554743408072
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	3.0279465698743144
And people have spoken in the past about BSE.	2.9791964047371637
This is an approach, Mr President, which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation.	5.69772181657264
The credibility of the industrialised north is at stake.	2.2158476958589777
I believe that this issue is relevant to my question. Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named 'official opening' of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.	2.93628785607543
This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance.	3.416904846103274
There is one problem that I hesitate to mention today as I am new in the sector.	2.4387423108962847
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives.	3.060842690673522
This House has only prepared one report on this Convention. It was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the Council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed.	2.6905825572488546
The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law.	3.798004136763339
By blocking the demands of the financial industry, the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall.	3.591513766978862
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment.	3.204995623155544
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union.	2.3674602140038177
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize.	2.1241842049137105
This has since been unanimously approved.	1.9146639287552074
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility.	2.437459714253124
I cannot think of a better way to do it.	2.8359785753431845
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them.	2.417197742239135
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	2.121042202755357
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme.	3.2917111681091686
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	3.511404130661419
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50% self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information, that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk.	2.7642422337013723
Furthermore, on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States, which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons, I shall, in the next few days, be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders.	3.212519332813789
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic.	2.036123767053157
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	3.87547935160784
Next we have the Puritan shift: the Teutonic Europe of the North, the Europe of the Lutherans, Calvinists and Quakers, wishes to inflict its moral order on us.	3.5686560426057956
Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes.	1.4364124492888106
Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully.	3.208416213617123
As a matter of urgency, therefore, we must restore, within the framework of a supplementary budget, the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters.	3.310235097782248
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon, so that it becomes accessible to everyone.	3.065377317992562
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%.	1.7777055792839314
Transport of dangerous goods by road	1.381821835052392
They cover provisions on the movement of workers, freedom of establishment, supply of services, current payments and movement of capital.	2.368261274133341
In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created.	2.9125557657022236
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable.	3.5117692040900472
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court.	2.8377212912595895
Mr President, the importance of this initiative is increasing constantly as economic and social problems in Europe' s cities intensify and the public feels more and more out of touch with the administration of its city or neighbourhood.	2.985952673012703
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise.	2.9422205428250767
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and, what is more, concepts.	2.5155123447644527
Thirdly, we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes, as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question.	3.1651623487341745
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	2.369122636258272
In my view, most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based, rationally argued and fully justified.	2.116026392715743
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.	2.7079287210295577
Mr Andersson also wants to see efficient and ambitious tax coordination, that is to say supranationalism in the fiscal sphere.	2.078396036368946
It is his first report here in plenary.	2.067090027897977
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	3.473735387057951
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line.	2.7665523457470513
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	2.806955734291192
It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance.	3.4040595827338187
It will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products.	1.5624765332063877
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter.	3.067861873327107
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern.	2.8570345713768557
Secondly, to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres, within these old quarters of our cities.	2.182631353386519
We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim.	2.6308228794148314
More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion.	3.013104468661088
They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities.	2.39716046592596
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society' s sustaining damage as a result.	2.74025711345641
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe.	2.3942349664121303
As far as Cyprus is concerned, part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the Greek and Turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all.	2.9762284531391696
Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible.	4.111260404850894
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.733808740104982
Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate.	2.460536993902221
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet.	2.286852753609118
Such policy should comprise various components.	1.4156647402982998
Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas.	2.76323086295925
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move.	3.780671515342304
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead.	3.1118211346037277
These should indeed be excluded from the directive. Secondly, the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars.	2.6755582309072383
We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything.	3.306224975964686
As for fishing, there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds, which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish, will certainly prove fruitful in the future.	3.089015353073585
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions.	2.8546570133195504
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries.	2.9901533923136
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up.	2.767664120581932
My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union.	3.062352332793484
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III, I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme, financed by the ERDF, and the other external cooperation funds, including in particular the European Development Fund, intended for ACP countries.	3.094512644980534
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority.	2.592827274400957
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need.	4.13786788413876
In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched.	2.3959850135380134
My second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward.	2.4550319343967737
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	2.6008172669158673
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases!	3.646106810590889
Additives in feedingstuffs	1677.0359576835476
Of course, every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case.	2.7737607611685355
I think we should give this some thought.	3.5882350519959445
That concludes the vote.	2.6033604357653695
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address.	1.7682073607366062
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field. In fact, we are aware that these are already happening widely.	2.8738508054587664
First of all, many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality, and increases poverty.	2.1519108783725867
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be.	3.5551205591024484
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things.	3.919179836532811
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is, of course, underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy.	2.431881479374014
Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications.	4.207444375951113
I would be grateful, Commissioner, if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against TSEs and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points.	3.506005488497242
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility.	2.7408925063188434
There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies.	3.624217257866995
For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	3.499076441536729
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed.	2.5128979135676786
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.	4.432847542848457
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	2.5009933721850617
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.	3.1403680723216207
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	2.9987876670052476
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency.	2.21746757789139
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform.	3.0643893894454557
This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit.	3.1047801146910063
Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner.	3.278659173896049
On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights.	2.7097663351168904
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer.	3.1553811078953453
First, it leans too far towards products based on indexes which have no bearing on the real economy; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which Mr Lipietz referred to just now.	2.180452943562543
This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it.	2.9511998441762737
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents, made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten's report.	2.4787627009348596
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.358888264058022
A better solution would be, as indeed the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism suggests, strengthened coordination between LEADER+ and the Community cooperation and partnership programmes, such as INTERREG, PHARE, SAPARD or MEDA.	2.1474815855017675
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market.	2.7120198069249506
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	2.5030512631658324
Because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group.	2.0320121073013304
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 (TEU) likely to be effected by such an exemption?	1.9215157059051864
In explaining my vote, I must say that it is positive that there is a Community directive on water, but I believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of Europe, but will lead to legislative caricature.	4.3352843139635775
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal?	2.3379836051184038
Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	3.738311859425574
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which, to some extent, is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas.	3.3434472740084593
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is.	2.5195450650884808
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major.	2.7820747278874225
Disabled people have too often been left off the list.	1.8456805251320316
With regard to the events of recent days, I would like to say - and I am saying this on the day, and the week, that the Intergovernmental Conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which, given what we have said about the Austrian crisis, I believe should be fully included in the Treaties.	3.943952368644362
VOTE	21.75018985665072
Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions.	3.553926133652082
Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	2.8773250542133084
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	2.3293483828048314
Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards.	3.1818486737516865
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.	2.4581630184311827
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	2.8308237121922084
I am anxious to know how effective the EU' s policy planning and early warning unit has been.	2.0517383391920077
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.	3.5165840596585483
This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle.	3.604549070334493
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way, but without forgetting public investment.	2.996539905854881
Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust.	2.2787734568811313
It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars.	3.062478202315092
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge.	2.3104743110351413
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem.	5.410845788529217
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity.	2.4972232686590985
Can I first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague, Mr Nielson, was that he could not be here but the honourable Members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is, trying to ensure that our agreement with South Africa survives.	2.5684911695588064
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.	2.7125711596830486
Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak.	2.3147506844120147
To my mind though, what is particularly important about the ALTENER II programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing, supporting and monitoring the Community strategy and the Community action plan.	2.281148287157897
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic, something we have long talked about.	2.3257869829971662
It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest.	3.0308949059350825
We understand that we also have a responsibility here, that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential.	3.138847696599467
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage.	2.988630213810632
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish.	2.3978221304013188
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this.	1.9072221214302822
We must, therefore, ensure that at the Intergovernmental Conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the Union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the House even today, with regard to the situation in Austria - the system of principles, values and rights underpinning the Union and the role of the political institutions of the Union, with regard, among other things, to running the economy.	3.577966721879186
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	1.8211070558866158
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south, particularly the countries around the Mediterranean, must not be abandoned.	3.3759637432290854
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what, if any, consideration has been given to it?	2.347981690566362
As recognised in the report, which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks, we accept that the directive contains some loopholes.	3.75765539426598
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians.	2.212982437126379
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy.	2.384856119532866
We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character.	1.8473975146775914
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways.	2.9452175121095023
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported.	2.8952094537670043
I have one observation, not a criticism, to make regarding Commissioner Prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy.	3.1562318877033873
Curiously, the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified.	2.405196451605095
I have for many years, in word and deed, been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia. However, recent events - firstly, what were really threats by the Council of Ministers, then Mr Prodi' s threats against the Austrian Commissioner and, finally, the present decision - are things I cannot support.	2.420223460287081
I might never have studied otherwise.	1.4314465901267948
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States.	2.8225861683927347
Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements.	3.0182175143148253
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	3.1853475375289246
In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy.	1.7696996994918797
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code.	3.1978972585490406
I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces.	2.6015391870371967
We should therefore put this situation right immediately.	2.1316225403679487
Until 1993, the way the Commission exercised its executive powers, and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements, was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions, and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure.	2.3577578409307116
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	2.6547319689938114
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	3.169287290495446
If the European Community had done the same, a great disaster would have been avoided.	3.701511680669031
To this end, the Brok report is a good instrument and it is really a bit distressing that, because this is a joint debate, it is politically overshadowed by the political position of the Council and the Commission and we cannot therefore say more about this good report.	4.0816453672521655
I wish we were closer to that.	1.6337265879603724
As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity.	3.092094180134153
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way.	2.447644845254657
These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc.	2.0915091231246885
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.	2.2089564642785398
Mr President, I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups.	3.534104167959344
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation.	3.759488138502503
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude, even physical absence, of the strong man of Damascus, President Assad, at the negotiations in the United States.	2.4361388488491675
It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc.	2.756916922475171
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost.	2.0204787775195743
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform, as the Council has resolved to do, and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny.	3.342210639274962
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement.	2.1358869935419507
As you know, there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens.	2.8118137538647985
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation.	4.26727201396996
Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations.	4.410131862381406
And, finally, I want to say that I think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we, as consumers, are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and, at the same time, obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which, I believe, there is broad agreement.	3.0013304190164707
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	2.009582867485774
Financial instrument for the environment (LIFE)	2.760111726425011
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	2.982001616755057
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure.	4.90407326737572
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you.	2.4731375685546633
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question.	4.0418124642754725
It would seem to us that the Council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions, the rights of the defence, the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally empowered to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly.	2.7555318844440517
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards.	1.644659297880163
Many European cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high-added-value activities and high-income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes, high unemployment, substandard and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency.	1.8184477170161928
Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	2.6458898236086728
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee.	2.7184559808847757
It is not only the targeted, specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport.	2.924975240685394
It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU.	2.4433243087696512
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold.	2.2640872048601652
It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas!	3.0948126045771787
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns.	2.1139703514354458
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures.	1.5426812034694304
I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do.	2.894268376189288
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination.	2.439038016636749
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	3.2599563417961295
As far as I am concerned, that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the Annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in Parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here.	2.505164181780271
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.	1.7274659632548173
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators.	2.6065431111974817
Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer.	3.63686194102522
This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.	3.194116122136478
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	2.463695617229307
I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area.	4.257856968812522
Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains.	2.77443449424067
	32.62528478497609
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	2.206619270095797
(FR) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle, the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP, i.e. their former colonies.	2.980470613512959
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition.	2.966716657613886
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending.	2.91076441989763
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	2.45352654023301
I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers.	3.071760502921442
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.	3.2291391663236726
Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs.	2.055568749523338
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.	2.9945538949606814
And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	2.9116974381075504
Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	3.2256676809643117
We had heard about this regrettable incident.	1.4675742784528842
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data.	4.336300151041159
We need to do something about it.	6.2460008010653265
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position.	3.021334244227765
I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way.	3.299390225383345
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands.	3.709840111013952
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.	2.4785662291800987
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	2.29972507338651
We are looking for solutions.	2.9381299197219257
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	2.5756252406874443
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' .	2.348223625004625
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	3.209510192814037
Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved.	3.358797153773683
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence.	3.2155068191820972
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available.	3.547415196322317
I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.	2.7637407647257635
At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required.	3.7185418023863805
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties.	3.3445173801630186
No farmer, anywhere in the world, will produce something if prices are too low.	2.3209112581225604
I feel that this behaviour, particularly in your presence, is unacceptable and totally repugnant, especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign.	3.3884612288058613
Ultimately, it is a question of different spheres of authority, where the European Parliament and its Members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands.	3.0344860141995555
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo' s speech set here.	2.9867560485404496
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities.	2.4266715448982006
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted.	2.392004105341726
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important, that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme.	3.087042834092422
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles.	2.078597257075831
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too.	3.286997922690875
Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003.	2.1337138717832294
(More than twelve Members of Parliament rise to their feet) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.8003706791587257
Thank you, Mr Napolitano.	6.090286721203043
We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet.	2.4915934768154866
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised.	3.6378836785700694
Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries.	4.112911536082338
Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions.	2.2346011357098265
Some Members have even come out against this.	2.192400349089566
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services.	4.7704627026432345
This question needs to be resolved urgently.	4.569136701891287
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union.	2.8924911089662677
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament.	2.159503516371178
It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid.	3.670184297715406
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session.	2.3325300150383215
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections?	1.6697105782556305
If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them.	3.4446079420784317
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank.	1.761002300590494
Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans.	2.5435770802339124
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	2.4183721020226696
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly.	2.056346216936718
I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi.	3.0689010706943005
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	2.222754580238961
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you.	2.5900617215715194
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	1.9848498634577245
I also reject this line of argument.	1.7027247954435154
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive.	3.876807083422967
There are concerns even within the Fifteen, concerns which may even surface again in the next decade.	2.7420119663162232
You can be what you want to be.	4.003965241011909
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words, but a demonstration of our actual political commitment.	2.1315553272651284
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	3.5856064423543317
The Committee on behalf of which I am speaking, namely the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, decided in December, on the assumption that the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture would draft such a good report, that we could waive our opinion.	3.54473339138987
It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing.	3.3045386686439566
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled.	1.7415292614310305
Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with.	3.2878980760998413
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving.	1.5409179915250997
However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives?	2.7110263100151086
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all.	3.0374390089979397
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States.	3.4367836649363928
In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society.	3.541565420478261
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	3.0333681873959955
This is no longer tolerable.	3.040826534221351
Mr President, Commissioner, whenever a serious social problem occurs, it always has a political basis. This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido.	2.52781333584807
We cannot leave it simply to governments.	1.567884882040965
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said.	1.9320846957097455
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	2.84720166097852
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol, tobacco, petrol and consumer goods.	1.4643410666467538
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions.	2.806314370283985
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	3.5905398230826
Member States, i.e. national authorities, are responsible for implementing this strand. Finally, strand C organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries to exchange experience under strands A and B and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development, subject to consultation with the European Commission which is responsible for its implementation.	2.9046352391292443
In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, 'Better Hitler in France than the Front Populaire.'	2.513647084682177
Questions to Mr Bolkestein	5.772112614371519
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	5.753949340673271
Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort.	2.572490269783282
However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive.	2.251351403515011
That is what the debate we are having is all about, on the subject of which I have this to say to you: we need more freedom and less state intervention.	3.9025484135016812
Mr President, the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile Commission, to whom it was to be granted, had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity.	2.6097339006046703
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women' s participation in the political decision-making process.	2.433565846605004
However, I would like to insist on certain points.	3.448061382812293
Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation.	2.5102529755399368
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion, this was a real relief.	3.230085259551266
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems, which are not touched, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty.	2.923934877967984
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate.	3.677441871162245
- (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy.	2.651684714594467
Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment.	3.2645325579124185
At midday, Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region.	2.9235960944190373
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome.	2.480496358013751
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding.	3.634823742994309
In offering this explanation of my vote, therefore, I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern.	2.352106371722546
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence.	2.5309128148663267
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	2.9937866953120857
In addition, it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO, as a matter of urgency.	4.623915824149429
It is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against Austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that, in any case, the European Union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act, and to prevent and rectify the course of events.	3.7908486768625966
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough.	2.6316724648784935
Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called "soft law" .	1.899381605129224
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions.	3.1739655830078037
In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter.	2.566982031068021
We could, as the Commission has proposed, accept these overlong deadlines which the Commission and the Council have extended even further. Yet if we do, we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public, but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again.	3.1699662125096006
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect.	3.0525877523487237
However, the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text.	4.056940206087541
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now.	3.407625857111554
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.	2.4600551210957913
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else.	3.2455546319307786
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State.	2.452910735879394
Would it not be beneficial, in the short term, following the Rotterdam model, to inspect according to a points system in which, for example, account is taken of the ship' s age, whether it is single or double-hulled or whether it sails under a flag of convenience.	2.8156410633343265
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote.	2.8233846254321513
These events certainly have their origin in, among other factors, the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully.	1.9384672706745063
As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.	2.5806073241520613
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns, which a number of you termed arbitrary.	2.9026988888475143
Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets.	4.17901933410831
This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional.	2.1434129245352858
Thank you for your statement.	3.2389423047149624
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe.	3.5214827298221056
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this.	2.855411750347422
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.	2.0600196219522844
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future, for Europe' s economy, and, above all, for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general.	3.8227280479719967
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers.	2.885777323236111
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.	4.191124186549644
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	2.3634317244450376
Your approach, which I am very much in favour of, since it is a coherent one, takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights; I wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights.	3.905373982057855
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January.	3.287112905618453
However, the people are fighting back, as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible Seattle Summit. The leaders of the world, headed unfortunately by the European Commission, rushed forward submissively, hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world, Mr Clinton, would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table.	2.937701859489211
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	4.058490907001023
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for.	1.6018590599307723
Mr President, liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology.	2.3153208952671513
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company.	3.5691626717059113
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	2.210746891050942
What could be the cause of this?	4.494675474472508
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy.	2.4045558095703545
Furthermore, we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue.	4.403332295391537
Not to save jobs.	1.6715396169401238
I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union.	3.174151421273382
Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid.	2.5721006426804047
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage.	2.966943800378695
We therefore hope that the Commission, in the report it is going to present to us on global policy, will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of Community resources and the specific management of public interests.	3.659115785125494
People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system.	2.8714975793780826
Reform of European competition policy	1.829204581229933
This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself.	2.2324320280921097
It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds.	2.46123302573112
Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, "Women are half of heaven" , a successful man once said.	3.100088038831538
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	2.6979106528558745
As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate.	2.7288324656110508
Mr President, Commissioner Patten, today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times, a country that is, however, moving in a very promising direction, thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community.	3.454834929660713
It also, of course, finds indirect expression in the question.	2.5975431363975754
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally, but also vertically, by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community.	2.8547305488201955
However, Mrs Lienemann' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water.	1.931754979013629
These violent scenes at El Ejido are so similar to archive pictures of Alabama in the 1950s, when the KKK terrified the black population, that it is hard to tell them apart. They also put us in mind of Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis were persecuting the Jews.	2.745895197519276
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena.	2.280549031477439
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.	3.505731814347546
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks, even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions.	1.8763522091347649
Our experience with that pilot project in Bilbao led us to four conclusions: firstly, that Europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore, far from reducing the EUR 900 million for the last five year period to EUR 700 million for this five year period, the funding of this project should be increased. This should be done, for example - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has proposed this - by reinvesting, in URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which each Member State has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose.	2.6124839505259434
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	1.920891728796763
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	3.1709501224227616
This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen.	3.2683719795875015
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this.	2.2737457025544376
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	2.348905821084496
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure, as proposed by the Commission.	2.540122762953357
Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time.	3.471690927898331
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	2.638340887541173
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	1.620099496207237
Both biological and economic information are included.	1.8870197945680878
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	2.828527508237877
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary.	2.4623266415003355
Nevertheless, I would like to say that Yugoslavia was what it was, in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people' s ethnic differences to a degree. It must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative.	2.7736728423247503
So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.	4.781254791609826
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER+ is a maximum of 5 months.	2.3316746928611387
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated.	2.9249648552503595
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	2.4855138441902986
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense, without any real negotiation or discussion.	2.4373965888354756
The statements we have heard today on the Middle East peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which Minister Gama - whose absence from this debate I also regret - has made of the region, accompanied by other Council representatives.	2.5445160791706565
In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step.	2.628869281756599
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over, not just because it was over, but because we all knew that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.	2.663455407358169
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent.	3.6702244771820736
We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP.	3.993712453973723
Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures.	2.711101582969628
This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue.	3.051311739887129
Instead, we should be reforming and decentralising control.	3.8324884031064594
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes.	2.1635825640216804
We do not have another law at the moment, and until we do, we must deal with genetically-modified micro-organisms as and when we pass legislation; we must include them as an add-on and insist that they be labelled.	2.9721598629113473
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with all these major political challenges, but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway, we are also faced with major opportunities.	3.2305049790092863
He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so!	3.2631716912150535
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.	2.639475138671666
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	3.123900191440418
I shall now, therefore, put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote.	3.549997631781441
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded: principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights.	2.619559961904954
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking.	1.9779070790520308
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy.	1.9755779289980764
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	2.967214773086595
The last century was marked by three periods.	1.5840738161422747
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	2.744085990758523
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against.	1.9200022651026911
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.8270090131155756
However, I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations.	3.117193225206607
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk, many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels.	3.1437519262582936
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	2.4723086533080743
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end.	2.794593032340185
Mr President, I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report.	4.233193217245148
So, really, these bodies should already provide for a balance, and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process.	2.36375909773685
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	3.0228761146160634
. (FR) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.	2.5816209880001884
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market.	2.977484431019722
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party.	3.236532650903632
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals.	1.7625395661627625
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work.	2.4900999034012785
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union.	2.51021322586862
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.	3.322254794807171
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	2.8387598248205284
I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid.	3.6266084878730993
Given the oral amendment, we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done.	4.034495803397271
In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia.	2.831820142139748
Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House.	3.484968827297824
No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union' s credibility.	2.480904137908363
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament.	3.6210651872381283
Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources.	3.127018027317515
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	1.6634238620972148
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	1.7997919913772902
Merit must be recognised and rewarded, specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade.	2.468845463882722
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines.	2.8748331342958773
That is what I would have preferred, personally.	4.6496882934350525
Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions.	2.3148078911128613
It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience.	5.656330134670105
We should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention, and then requested another: the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it, even if we hope that the amendments, which nevertheless improve the text, can be incorporated by the Council - we doubt that they will be, but hope all the same that they are.	3.572363910993218
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	2.511111128668986
However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification.	4.539201877284288
A flexible Europe, is a Europe which respects its national democracies, which relies on the support of its nations, its national patriotisms, instead of continually persecuting them.	2.3904910729544024
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion, there will be no cohesion at all, only disunity.	2.5274471516813044
Today, as previously in the history of Europe, right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life.	3.4264365737770284
The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues.	3.3963664244147074
I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds.	2.528093400233797
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations?	2.229130849018336
Or on Shell?	1.2724781768216695
The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	2.029164636658384
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer, who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening.	2.6340676847871154
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing.	2.028813926458119
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	2.54157772307984
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text, simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp.	2.4263980345998695
The resolution I would love to have a debate on in Parliament one day is on demining, and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines: stocks in the Ukraine, stocks in Moldova and stocks elsewhere.	2.2063229952836694
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	2.6143466216502453
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report.	2.59386706263796
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there, but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes.	2.687786476298511
Forgeries are big business.	1.4469737124036832
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution.	2.208033173660043
Mr President, the agreement we are debating today, as analysed by Mr Swoboda, which I hope we will adopt tomorrow, constitutes the second politically positive step, after the stability pact for the area.	3.406093189668203
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings.	3.0029861914076954
Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.	3.815834283121734
Secondly, like him, I think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which, in the final analysis, will prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.	3.0522354161877763
I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	3.6867261039884873
The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation.	3.6206611312566066
In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world.	5.392085684583759
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	3.2473497077874267
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about, the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion.	2.2480713375739305
As was emphasised at Tampere, and as part of our preparations for the Feira European Council in June 2000, we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross-pillar policy strategies, which strengthen the links between the Union' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the Union' s position on the world stage.	3.1341100053707627
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	2.6190102567225364
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson.	6.302893865683407
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this.	2.038073725025395
Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	3.1906258313196236
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid.	3.3119600920922583
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees.	2.454798693071563
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	2.9571357248635928
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process.	2.6067544600347303
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding.	2.4758048950440434
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	2.8766013375154036
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature.	2.163087496918887
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	4.653571879349285
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings.	1.4960488083559724
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	1.932338055667264
As the European Parliament, we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and, at the same time, demanding tightening up of the quality criteria, on the European and international scale, of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport, stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders.	3.0222901493941428
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices.	2.330119574787641
I understand this.	2.5081800093987026
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report.	4.103057903117055
I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue.	2.86632682524131
Whose turn is next?	1.4586605262433394
It looked, as Mr Schulz once aptly said in committee, as if the Council understood the area of freedom, security and justice to mean an area in which the Council has free rein, security from Parliament and the right to do and order as it will.	3.0005645580133886
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion.	2.3027951761926775
I appreciate that it is a provocative question.	4.681442806433637
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	2.4005757358219446
We, however, second the Council' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus.	3.5195251952442415
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future.	2.8426251076945466
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect.	3.354875386721525
Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes.	2.9569968574730057
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.	4.634000793818488
At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions.	3.0789845824755955
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets.	4.686250129774806
We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria.	3.9543162423002505
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources.	2.1181886155300496
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit.	1.871682523183034
Mr President, Commissioner, since the issue of employment has been raised, I want to recall another issue which is also very serious, namely the bankruptcies among Tour Operators and their consequences mainly for hotels, which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are trustworthy.	2.6585488764205065
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate, by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers.	2.5426435805471113
The question is, therefore: what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet?	2.671744052446904
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry.	1.7497979719780201
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits.	1.70322598141501
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world.	3.0073138333991327
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy, then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises, particularly humanitarian ones, are essential prerequisites.	2.3053310641154234
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf.	2.443797655717148
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	3.0340865816345817
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action.	3.582261771444516
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	1.9179247935731427
But that is his strategy, he instigated this war.	2.2100144051122217
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble!	1.781175583583968
In terms of outlook, the document points to an upswing, to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this, which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon.	2.842803398230209
Mr President, it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive.	3.6765176834768756
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces.	2.190948575257576
Just look at transport policy; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries.	2.357817234570306
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	2.4208744325519502
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left,	2.387701728591647
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff.	2.517705785304653
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy.	2.934135698892617
Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today.	2.8705853282358067
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market.	2.0943160663235645
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable.	2.4640194337341024
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information.	2.505293396037131
This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances.	4.858376617225872
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola.	2.5413091424888723
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major step forward for the European Union.	2.479591760590081
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct.	2.730584138240669
At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position.	4.063475775528619
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May.	3.9406443931869317
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances.	4.267888782158293
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	2.494543969674697
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter, for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done.	2.483614251165144
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it.	3.444207638427784
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high?	2.358947618997629
Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction.	2.9853541629211455
In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister.	3.5504839087083377
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price.	2.6536743474495053
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability.	1.925758836998461
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House.	3.261678020835089
All workers in the fishing, fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard.	2.476711855524237
The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)].	2.1899625615279454
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	2.9612422853698357
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR, in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero?	2.033317357083257
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	3.2209409028349647
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.	3.312020837056213
The unions will have something to say as will industry.	2.028657587429357
The Treaty of Amsterdam states quite clearly that, where people' s health is concerned, Article 152 is the correct legal base, and may I say to our own Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that it is simply not good enough to look at the Commission' s proposal and say, there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection, so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection.	3.1704235326119363
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation.	2.8473793385444823
We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations.	2.775463614641921
Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species.	2.3376084567583195
On one hand, there are the words and, on the other, their real political meaning.	3.918652916166927
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you.	2.4729542773566773
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament.	2.4472584936579214
Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance.	1.6344778051015225
Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight.	2.9617073099128772
Madam President, Mr Prodi, you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element: confidence.	2.3356650390749145
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	2.641689787415006
Our objective, the committee' s objective, the Court of Auditors' objective is not to abolish financial control, it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control.	3.1882241709424126
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council.	3.291308231635321
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.	2.7951131714545556
However, we already knew this.	4.98216752253043
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation.	3.4993540978531885
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions.	3.1864202841870384
It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion.	2.499995505495768
For example, you did not go into antibiotics.	5.5702012888601065
Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority.	3.1402958703148123
As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval.	3.3747361865568926
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level.	2.168852143016074
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	2.7646294909092535
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	2.5227964718659526
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	5.057538057409867
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union.	2.5872561233788476
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too, provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established.	3.147784011857887
However, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report, this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter.	3.542788546419704
The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling.	3.3813513925770864
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming, with the social distress taking the form of unemployment, misery and crime.	3.0117417613812867
Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible.	2.9237371682182567
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and, at the same time, that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue.	3.5344895052538154
We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate.	3.3232815318643203
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for all her work and her cooperative attitude, even if we have agreed to differ on certain points.	2.455363314151074
Mr President, it feels quite strange to be standing here again today, as I have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years, and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence, and not by force majeure.	3.0068624414373466
Firstly, the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed.	3.108871580169179
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled.	2.070684158133865
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level.	2.7133937100734316
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation.	2.785671469708742
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing?	1.985495337280367
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	2.604759657618678
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Since then, of course, this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is, but which it refuses to see itself as.	2.2330197411264394
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion.	2.7477524689352197
Any analysis of economic development in recent years, if objective, will show, through the figures, that they have no political colour or orientation.	2.7649353035584805
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system.	1.4663922677995787
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees, the topic of the debate.	3.4610259873126945
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	2.845293720602265
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate, even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters.	2.668605773514606
I am in favour of social protection, I am in favour of the original Commission document, but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high.	3.504821408678107
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents.	2.203826073388509
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine.	3.6212352433415487
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee.	3.60302599629727
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.	3.4244830464864116
Mr President, today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony.	4.098672521118047
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future.	2.4377527264739887
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth.	1.7525291458518601
Commissioner, Mr President, Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto.	3.3873182853520207
I repeat: we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance.	2.8875437113618387
My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	2.5863313328929634
Secondly, we will all want to take proper account of what has actually been happening in China in recent months, for instance, the heavy sentences imposed on democracy campaigners, the detention and recent punishments meted out to members of Christian churches and the arrests and sentences of the members of Falun Gong.	2.63206575059165
Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.	1.9331542891123785
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level.	2.411974462589143
The post office is democracy.	2.837065036536526
Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC.	3.157047770495719
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary.	2.988686632521866
Mr President, I voted for the Procacci report on rural development, not only because I endorse the major policy lines of the LEADER programme, but also because it complements the URBAN programme, which I spoke about earlier.	3.471903742035764
Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, in fact, that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers.	3.816535134898557
In order to function, the market needs rules.	4.978009431865776
If the Alliance is still active in that region, it is with the same objective.	3.478017261973496
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted.	2.807596416545097
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission.	3.305451497430455
I believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this Chamber by a former fellow MEP of ours, Tom Spencer. He suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women, we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time.	2.3657304404150508
In short, we claim that we want to help developing countries and, at the same time, we encourage the liberalisation of trade, which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective.	3.05731427113985
Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation.	2.2839284363900383
The particular difficulties in Mitrovica - for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems.	2.2080106037182046
It highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved, chiefly those involved at a local level, who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems, hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships, which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned.	2.672636004904144
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change.	1.9139751351388963
As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated.	3.580473986669861
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital.	3.2888915597712756
However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	3.6852420748850343
An important element of LIFE-Nature, which mainly concerns the realisation of the Natura 2000 network, is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities, so as to avoid the fragmentation of biotopes and to offer better protection of biodiversity.	2.37696252337455
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken, which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues.	5.819860943895459
Opinion of an MEP from the north of Europe: "This Directive would be unfair since, for example, the cost for an inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of Naples ".	2.0952239095002048
Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens.	3.608430934759494
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable.	2.845696367600345
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word "qualifications" also crops up.	1.741403550475732
We have always supported ECHO, its policies and its actions, even some which have been disputed by certain bodies. We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU' s external action.	2.5728032069096005
You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come.	2.7426931097354035
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	3.282231403350865
I do not believe this to be the case. The reason for this decision was, rather, that we wanted to have a special instrument for the Eastern and Central European States which, like Malta and Cyprus, are involved in the accession process, but under different conditions.	3.1391369645767835
The matter of the European Union' s recognition of a high-quality postal service, available to all, remains valid today, and we are increasingly concerned.	3.998062240203514
Since the end of the cold war, compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation.	2.4098598139344554
Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse.	3.5049906105514212
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver "EC service provision card" and not "EU service provision card" .	2.2799726877412523
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses, coaches and other vehicles, so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them.	2.573098552096398
On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law.	2.56431848893067
Take a large successful business, add European regulations, and within months you have created a small one.	1.7253227766283106
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings.	1.751910514504608
At the moment, the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated.	2.5272700235783323
The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar.	2.183662491366138
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation)	2.2007818758143682
Langen Report (A5-0073/1999)	1.288342709821954
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.	2.2067176865837737
This is what we need for ships.	4.4654343129505785
. Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.	3.9346416889930462
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole.	2.21381032776842
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference.	3.2384871463995997
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	2.3108972555726512
You do not need a Nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets, which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25% is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term.	2.5018965700660605
I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised.	3.171566305562135
Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report.	4.085026510191102
Secondly: the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime, including by Europol and Eurojust.	2.311042798080647
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	3.0015252347223713
Via the structural funds, a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system.	3.7849855266190557
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations.	3.652074740199866
We decentralise administrative and, in some cases, financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective.	2.4435122853326043
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic.	2.9276606252394504
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority.	2.445045627344887
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians.	2.633576912382606
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct.	2.508510130727178
All in all, I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report.	4.863455991144634
Mr President, Commissioner, Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium.	3.0075866266705664
We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well.	2.5540891242721995
Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report.	3.464849423168216
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	3.3742762154128925
Overly strict, unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable.	3.1664036688627815
The report seeks "effective and ambitious fiscal coordination" , without going on to define more specifically what this means.	1.7165224746673242
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	1.9124575143551925
Women are systematically raped.	1.2933680528640947
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed, because you need to hope in order to be disappointed.... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate.	3.113560037904571
In view of this unusual situation, will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises?	2.721203553081323
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance.	3.052256162087512
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority.	2.6067362942791665
However, instead of imposing a new regime, we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime.	2.7797220180405424
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work, of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices.	3.1588959183738536
The next step, i.e. institutional reform, will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference, in which the European Parliament will be fully involved.	4.104660475355684
Policy on tourism is not, however, something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole.	4.042153286078759
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	2.6308051540394315
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far.	2.2055772945099745
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	5.879414107654514
Finally, we have to put our trust in, and support, the institutions which are closest to the citizens, that is, the local councils and bodies.	3.8549486205773826
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes?	2.447492142029225
Today' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed, and one which I welcome.	2.8767028720298775
We are nonetheless, as is our right as well as our responsibility, telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand.	2.5128574500006846
- (PT) Mrs McKenna, a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission.	3.2880755953205916
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	2.3232648757583316
Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view.	3.1559193912893577
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy.	5.097713362357206
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	2.9424129137057546
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management.	1.9595283561602133
I want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible, both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned, in other words, we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000.	3.4669292020129614
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	2.5469568992696248
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis.	2.786344699041315
In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative.	2.0511844924653144
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	2.7989155360224687
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.	2.803914511262847
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments.	4.988424161237731
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal' s point of view.	3.18578698667197
In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later.	3.499593640444334
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	2.7673926464554195
This has obliged us to abstain from the final vote, because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each Member State can dedicate, to URBAN projects, that portion of the Structural Funds which it has not spent in accordance with Community programmes.	2.8209230364716578
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	2.698264897793932
The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States.	3.052317556945809
When it comes to medical checks and so on, I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer.	3.4621575189049416
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	2.5166882103157944
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well.	2.861023615967969
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world.	4.068625468940534
Quotas are one of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.	4.313046999688435
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	2.19086116719961
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	3.1884185726217593
Specifically, I must stress in this debate the plan for Morocco. This is a country with which the European Union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration.	2.9869914754241775
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the information of the House, Mr President, I should like to make a clarification.	4.063856586708914
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	1.4754569351776614
Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement.	3.966587480941513
We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made.	1.7658971248611788
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform.	4.233548853990578
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful?	1.6403617482127189
In this way, we would have no problem in acting immediately. We would not create problems for the Kosovar people, but, on the other hand, we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing.	3.7699356932462362
In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication.	2.0492214547268364
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	3.6352648227217985
But to enlighten the decision makers, let us practise honest science, without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats.	2.4159382156107676
This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments.	4.010550284647224
Urgent change is required today.	1.9801852307144439
Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all.	2.3579158372759412
But, despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services, a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission.	2.9097228102873056
Again on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party, I have asked the Council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue, which is frankly unsatisfactory.	3.658499061721093
Another subject being discussed is the release of the Albanians held in prisons, particularly Flora Brovina, a woman of extraordinary humanity whom I met, together with the Women in Black of Belgrade, during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups.	1.7771129850615333
The first key concern is independence.	1.4348632847502023
Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons.	3.4284730720953775
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002.	2.103624845850239
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	2.5843841403056627
You will be familiar with some reputable companies, our French fellow MEPs will be familiar with some reputable companies, but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements, and these must be struck off the list.	2.2459771056450073
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party!	2.320049969623783
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	2.4072372707052456
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers.	2.377966292023024
But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of "normalisation" and "harm reduction" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people.	2.492487996199255
It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty.	3.629323428703973
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale.	1.4830165949133947
During these years, the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport.	2.6702228629526044
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this, especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states.	3.715872647567278
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier, who described the state of the world in terms of the economy' s reign of terror.	4.70676599768343
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism, sanctions and are even brought to trial, such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced.	1.9731698791780024
Quite simply, we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty.	4.372017546425578
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament, we should take measures to prevent this occurring again.	3.893308116981645
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account.	2.1192453747535156
It is useless to talk of the Roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from Krajina, who are now living, barricaded in, in Kosovo, abandoned by the UNHCR, which itself has been abandoned by the donors, while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions.	2.777313989802568
Relating to Friday, on Friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the Group of the Party of European Socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in Brussels, as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda.	2.612622041777041
For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price.	3.4133371003211845
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression.	2.8148288255260225
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people. We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner.	3.154808778226077
Although it may have been effective in certain areas - and I do not doubt the sincerity of Commissioner Barnier' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry.	2.8538386420881503
Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention.	2.262046781076111
We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns.	3.025952635094539
This is a big task but it can be done.	4.981424442226157
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme.	3.614881499960892
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	3.514533307454325
As this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme, the presidency believes that it is worthwhile, bearing in mind the principles of Chapter VI of the Treaty, to explore suitable means of providing the European Parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the United Nations Convention.	3.146304781673751
Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax.	2.623315473966727
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction.	3.23937289950772
Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill.	2.4345126844694915
Indeed, it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge.	2.2620722248584455
Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure.	5.798748149321721
It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	2.927375916898988
Mr President, I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture.	3.68515770327284
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome.	3.050682115353191
But, equally, we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination.	2.0394640805378974
Question No 1 by (H-0022/00):	1.1672026996941478
In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations.	2.588756857297566
I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all.	2.7886626610745946
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	1.8033230233052548
I would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget.	3.129405364537327
As the Parliament' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report, Mr Kinnock, I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process, and if I may say to all colleagues here, we have a very important task to do, which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness.	3.9018343021114177
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	2.521513053533521
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002, everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro.	2.3619377164752198
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	2.148313406214996
However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law.	2.6524292200568467
I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate.	2.201020395343087
If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres.	3.2999620609425726
) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	2.6312305069954096
The work in relation to BSE in Member States and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in Member States is ongoing, I know that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has asked me this question before and I said I thought it was coming along quickly but I understand it is in inter-service consultation in the Commission and work is currently under way.	3.0298029623839926
However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle.	3.44197605134941
That concludes Question Time.	1.201702454267055
I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation.	1.6750150821518581
Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000)	1.0525208825556664
Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate.	3.7108809259288775
By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations.	3.1509461215357404
On the contrary, I object to this systematically applied strategy.	2.173744607621453
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	3.173652333137006
	32.62528478497609
My Group has included two reasonable requests.	1.926637925412134
We already have an infrastructure.	2.9877729850114956
The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection.	4.246415242311244
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources.	1.9981051482186583
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	2.2734817524033866
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land.	3.2601492615872223
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament, after its excellent political debate yesterday, should not adopt a stance on this matter.	2.710600039626751
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us?	2.3290128279405793
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life.	3.0497255050960232
Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies.	3.1584720287148245
In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.	3.043945877603499
We have put down an amendment to that effect.	2.5777025738167634
I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results.	3.4994763382967595
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January.	2.3385958196303562
Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme.	3.65409371315905
We shall now move on to Question Time.	2.519617305296612
Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit.	1.775100740416634
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction, towards European exclusiveness and apartheid.	2.7779445584590303
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	2.6184948688185523
(The Minutes were adopted)	3.18562742641999
As a result, the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded, not even in a bad economic climate.	2.353343793322697
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable.	5.27226885134559
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	2.7286182430256924
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position.	3.841275417614256
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may.	2.3906751261176784
In this sense, the USA is not only our partner; it is also our competitor; not our opponent, our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model.	2.6357624806402127
It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties.	3.1630881145335796
On the contrary, we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms, in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note.	2.633965786523418
For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation.	2.3967698856960555
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test.	2.6681552341336805
As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.	4.763528999540187
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection.	1.8991723913556497
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly, it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode.	2.5621066845233504
The proposals in Mrs Theato' s report seek to encourage the Commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection, under criminal law, of our financial interests, which would criminalise certain activity, specifically fraud against the Community budget. These proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole Community.	2.7715084260758713
I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level.	2.4608796010070266
It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities.	4.572849849611229
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question.	3.419973928304595
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.	3.0502434626006223
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work.	2.6320239961395755
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path, rather it makes dramatic statements such as: what we need is state intervention, not the extension and consolidation of the market economy.	2.6405280637956103
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry, we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments.	2.4981315242302475
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	2.940723041898381
These and other specific measures included in my report can, in my view, lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster, in order to promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium-sized firms, particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour.	2.5805663128058303
As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described.	2.9815928550422695
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	2.461976340007986
Firstly, I welcome proposal No 1.	4.755177828686245
In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed.	3.1762925656134264
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.	2.1176831960893834
(FR) Madam President, when a Swede, a Spaniard, a Luxembourgeois and a German have to negotiate in English, linguistic ambiguities will arise.	3.2576203848130403
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period. This represents a drop of 30%!	2.9818123181988043
In all modesty, I would claim that this is something that documents that the Commission is willing to walk or fly the extra mile in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests.	3.3663220897926123
Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated.	2.658387640813926
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures.	4.192514309391113
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	2.3646480733004718
"We do not have the wherewithal for that," they said.	3.077103090719732
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point.	2.269340333201034
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances.	3.579007825134896
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry.	2.8887460007703814
And that is why we have SOLAS (the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) and MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), two conventions of the International Maritime Organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all Member States of the Union and whose application will have to be monitored.	2.853993760208063
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact.	2.6533940155750133
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict.	2.6164878827302642
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports.	2.4426376573018924
. (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration.	3.407829317717791
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC.	4.534803885018093
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.	2.6399077292013753
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone.	2.499129678319059
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	2.920024496181916
I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting.	2.9156167734920055
Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades.	2.3294649048894276
I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.	2.474142366134524
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution.	2.076465653956494
I would like to quote verbatim from the report: "State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."	2.4992190401259036
Thank you for a very clear answer, the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the Danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements.	2.890651015887352
Parliament has amended the contractual text.	1.388068391266206
I pay special tribute to him for his success.	1.6195023391744576
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions.	2.2656470465795207
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested.	2.6379422590901185
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies.	2.594513465342978
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	2.1764369602772704
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	2.1782678948328007
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies.	3.9143057636288137
By this I mean, of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.	2.749053628040361
I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report.	2.6395458216910663
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, however worthy the cause.	2.54255006867357
But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes.	2.501496907390186
Sixthly and lastly, I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions, namely the legal privilege of company lawyers.	3.157365058903846
Firstly, private investment must be assisted.	1.6215771007175843
I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values.	2.6307182814574777
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	2.623432376609609
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation.	3.1365373672451367
I took the punishment that came to me.	1.955014966017252
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors' need for protection and security.	2.4238871068406564
Mr President, the common position is sound, but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles.	5.47757762859509
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.	2.738227847732314
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.3573064339158158
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on.	1.808871060915867
We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report.	2.7470576960231754
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved.	2.1795469521622364
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	2.668523459101179
A drop in standards should not be allowed.	3.3893020996890284
For this reason, I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises.	3.4746130463243676
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach.	1.9818871212289042
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget.	2.3044334017689216
Mr President, I am also pleased to welcome the Spanish Commissioner, Mr Solbes Mira, whom I have congratulated more than once, inside and outside this Parliament, on the excellent work he did in Spain on the subject of European convergence.	3.1983971928460373
After shellfish, the slump is now affecting crustacean sales.	1.4435341573540537
Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields.	3.1962429586743073
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	3.972689920534135
Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment.	2.21022287656008
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	4.108271607594011
Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision.	3.1605805943791294
After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing.	2.4732373745588734
If it is of any comfort to her, the Irish have not got their channel yet either.	2.3840222199158148
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	2.2472722786820127
It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union.	3.7877115069546448
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic.	1.830859265926309
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile.	3.4614396538417793
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements, that is to say a medium-term issue.	3.6960044103986274
(FR) Drinking, eating, washing, farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it, wrongly, as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource.	2.2304011037138998
Cambodia	21.75018985665072
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.	2.646372550011196
The credit for Mozambique' s success story must be shared equally by its government, by the opposition, but above all, by the people of Mozambique.	2.5793859515664557
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance.	4.151195631006357
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution. Quite the contrary, it would be a solution leading to calamity.	2.7248223481663447
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union.	3.0660747070562695
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	2.523347499821656
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	2.696456716856838
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market, only the body was being attacked. Now, it is the soul.	3.5089186577973623
I do believe that reform with all it implies, including the new mechanisms, will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind.	2.060094731743157
Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe.	2.6582815562677045
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	4.9298096368960564
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry, port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law. Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent.	2.2156154154178522
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	2.7522979158258782
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner.	2.7729970902061107
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your dedication.	3.3750212615056907
I support this proposal for a resolution, especially the points which refer to the application of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the Structural Funds allocated and the fight against exclusion.	3.2740549727410073
In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption.	2.6326095281554758
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	2.2877010187509232
It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least.	4.57137840900266
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998, this is not an imagined risk.	3.8885945078828836
According to the experts, Parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the European Commission. This task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life, and this should be a standing committee, not elected, presumably made up of another group of experts.	2.7968287801971443
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to.	2.823365603587225
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	3.718936995300575
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	5.037248756204182
Like many of my colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative.	4.362944120817799
This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces.	2.791909391829937
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time.	3.0462201119379237
Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres.	2.5297629541071442
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	2.478789629951543
I congratulate the rapporteur Karl von Wogau, who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification, indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken, and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion.	2.4256486409850826
Members, who, in the course of this debate, have properly praised Commission officials, who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity, hard-working and of great capability, are absolutely right in the comments that they have made.	2.8957872647939427
However, I do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the OTC derivatives, and I also think that as a European Parliament it is our duty to inform and impress again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long-term security, and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection.	2.9795635681473174
As I point out in my question, one to two days, and not one to two hours, need to be devoted to the subject.	3.081650867608991
Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it?	2.7712825902990836
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control.	1.9049021164754467
President.	77.3301660757284
We cannot afford to waste time.	2.1671154005363054
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.	2.3116631496582407
I will mention only two, in order to be brief.	3.062516475150956
It is not easy, indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing, that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties.	2.8695218056768046
It is, in fact, something very positive.	4.079185848761031
I can show you a copy if you wish.	1.9536984688138297
Mr President, LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy, both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries.	3.7742635975773036
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position, in my view, with precision, clarity and commendable brevity.	2.371916357890486
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	3.0389734037755955
However, I would just like to add the following.	4.472567056778351
A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands.	2.97100891763812
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities.	1.5330280524928908
So much for the quality.	4.983448181689069
Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe.	2.77551385621515
The current globalisation process is - and I quote - 'exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities' . The European Union' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the Union and in international relations.	2.891080662444991
However, Mr Decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the Brussels technocrats.	1.5756888768900297
I listened to your general guidelines and I would like to ask you what is the position of children, as entities in their own right, in the Commission' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty-first century.	3.559531211614306
We must work to ensure that, in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally, the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords.	3.7131492729386624
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts.	1.7723342315777393
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale.	2.341997318670708
Over recent years, these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed.	2.265656531317117
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems: Asturias.	2.245368715936077
Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism.	2.1449230895168485
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol.	2.038645089880508
In this sense, all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this.	2.0157401569717535
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors.	1.9498266018614263
Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect.	3.4091344240282595
In common with the other Members, I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned.	2.87194268614243
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid.	5.317497671626684
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	3.084493793755109
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis, we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance.	2.4168031803696555
The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.	2.3810343186556855
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is 'snake-heads' . It seems to me a fitting description of them.	1.8259044824284254
These problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there. This therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in El Ejido and throughout Europe.	2.4873994683750533
I shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which I feel is particularly dangerous: the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one Member State to another, with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the EU.	2.969383911166894
Austria is a free, independent and sovereign country.	2.432630072133166
To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee.	2.965881895784475
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people.	2.750332035093883
However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general.	2.983973217000536
Several people have lost their lives, many have disappeared, many have been injured.	2.1992239160753595
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water.	3.0421174130814084
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet.	2.587986066343244
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively, and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present.	2.755750064547857
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.	4.259899322840644
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	3.788969190031032
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.	3.112667942194466
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	2.9908351734115124
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic, social, and infrastructural measures.	3.3213120879722555
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative.	2.2617676528122885
The fact that we have a European car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are, in fact, a good many cars on European roads for which they must take responsibility.	3.6141390916677407
There is no room for amendments.	5.474855037187819
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued, non tourist areas, which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments.	2.1665264820191097
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment.	2.5948558605371623
This has an impact of course, because it is read by other members of the Council.	3.9756941532511263
Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement.	3.066926362318322
Lastly then, Europol, which started its work in 1999. The Council approved a set of instruments, with which Parliament is familiar, to make Europol' s operations viable but, of course, the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol still remain, and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in Tampere to reinforce Europol' s powers and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.	2.5475206551229306
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that.	2.2594980394341495
Finally, following on from what was agreed in Tampere, the report restates the need for a European Public Prosecutor. This issue has been brought once again to the fore by Commissioner Vitorino' s timely decision to ask the IGC to include in its agenda the creation of this new role, which everyone considers vital.	3.0671280592325436
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	2.609784006781379
Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States.	3.072407515006316
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	2.7826388281707466
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested.	1.982887819634353
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	1.9148164601503692
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working.	4.444507168380741
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten's report.	2.153257855891229
I am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for European tourism.	2.2490040716346957
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	3.6633953595412487
Mr President, allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question.	4.6214660617511125
In Europe, legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25% of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive.	3.60213015933862
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow, not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but, more seriously, for humanity as a whole.	2.4905225499217454
It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls.	2.2822266518159653
The challenge is to make the system the very best.	3.4789594903203094
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did.	3.6535056939241723
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights.	1.6955048106530315
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy.	2.8434208589918906
Thank you, Mr President.	5.456809481577716
Three amendments can be partially approved, and one can be approved in principle.	2.1415505258265326
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now.	2.022479869815776
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse.	2.6229830884973357
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion.	3.919341258971532
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.758146733328541
However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents.	2.482715412458382
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.	2.7758572604877623
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	4.601010807037919
Fourthly, we need the shipowner to bear liability, and not just to the tune of a derisory USD 12 million, but to the value of at least USD 400 million, to be covered per insurance certificate.	3.641473612748813
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.	3.3657923065103663
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price.	2.155085009544227
This is why we are abstaining.	5.008139034115741
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important, such as peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, food security, fisheries and immigration.	2.753572428886144
As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	2.2301387419844487
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s.	2.4043121203930675
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	2.485081244419779
One issue which is referred to in the van der Laan report is the whole question of the Gaza hospital.	2.984247401699629
Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated.	2.324536905136789
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises.	3.600043499305212
Macedonia' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries.	2.8573202402326983
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one.	5.220457984377344
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions.	3.1316530339502298
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been.	3.7048669213962593
The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States.	1.9063886866645647
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring.	3.476208021503627
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress.	3.254980050427076
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.	3.006946935973512
Even if we have new Rules of Procedure in Parliament, and it may well be that, with such an ambitious chairman in the Committee on Agriculture, problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment, one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict: cohesion in this Parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as I am concerned.	3.2140112525855487
What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used.	3.923979042264297
Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators.	2.759157980028896
- (FR) Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that the URBAN Community Initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis, all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	2.794626218864852
The ecological disaster on the banks of the Danube is a reminder, as if we needed one, that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water.	2.2353740767246437
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge.	1.4218319134889743
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.5387582135753672
Finally, in discussing the question of the future application of tests, we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable.	3.2525733972640354
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies.	2.0504171275939105
We agree with its substance, its tone and its scope.	2.189246108132762
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years' time.	1.6964755672950207
As the draftsperson for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the Legal Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee for their cooperation on this matter.	2.5776132266152962
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area.	2.5411553809755123
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted.	1.7374472566702512
The Commission is not in fact today a European government.	4.007439788045126
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	2.799666136415566
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	4.101375137387644
But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided.	2.824010483213389
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally.	2.5710591413130937
Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control.	2.484001772136392
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	2.552721034253612
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures.	2.5118818723192544
It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million.	2.335753781122467
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence.	1.96644390045266
In my view, and I say this quite clearly, the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused.	4.4703334039517095
Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this.	2.9630037760372336
In my opinion, the European Union can, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, supplement the action of the Member States and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures, such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the Treaties; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the Union, with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms: rural, environmental, cultural, conference-based, spa-related and sports-related tourism, and also tourism focusing on senior citizens, research and training; the amendment of Directive 95/57/EC on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences.	2.8891034165432603
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending.	2.7474205642991683
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	2.894500184340258
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition.	2.456419156604524
Quite the reverse, in fact.	2.324962366776451
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	4.315049458392727
We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender.	1.7305169667487392
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms.	2.99371054531379
The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR.	2.6876346765372174
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health.	2.9705470438419064
Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones.	2.5012759721965283
The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion.	2.5758596993350835
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware.	2.9988315967909003
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	3.7109098038635167
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure	1.2729432568116616
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget.	2.5354925800947417
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology.	3.726164558763206
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled.	3.6711566591709643
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	2.598283195768408
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	1.883962978591712
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable.	2.9408377019943903
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	2.5604011331815073
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union.	2.483823807635488
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people.	2.276334998297084
At the same time, the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas.	2.6612078917164137
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice.	2.8418882189841126
I particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth: the information society in an expanding European market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity, innovation enterprise, the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra-high value sustainable jobs for our European citizens.	1.9037346397710833
We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone.	1.8856468139339164
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	1.8113610739120296
There will be friendship, calm, openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process.	2.212832861591576
As you know, on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth.	2.825342002535593
It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way.	3.827036781932562
If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them.	2.8123520029665063
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission, who stood by with advice and expert help at all times.	2.617735257541425
The company' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying.	2.329351175364222
The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment.	2.934929575813713
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined.	2.3729973666569224
However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.	3.6570400776210326
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe.	2.9483714786182262
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this.	2.131424292841559
However, I remind this House that, back in June 1997, a Council resolution acknowledged the fact that there is a serious lack of coherence in some of the EU policies in relation to its development cooperation policy.	3.6133239160619013
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle.	2.9323929766787087
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	3.3373257939524095
Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly.	2.609635786313766
I would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion, and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion, for it is a long way off yet.	2.933350150197542
The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned.	4.282032940824292
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	2.7312989681964335
We will come back again with material on these issues, because these problems, in one way or another, are here to stay, simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally-defined trade interests, etc. We have to reconcile those different approaches.	2.614650098676589
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms.	3.094439887632415
We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.	3.052309018060279
This must be regulated during the IGC.	3.467458615486692
We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets.	3.1452209288667765
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade.	2.2229227144927934
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas.	2.190592381379785
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conference on rural development held in Cork from 7 to 9 November 1996 set rural development as one of the European Union' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture, to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services, and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life, diversification and job creation.	2.8168566165614317
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	2.8671987740364693
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace.	3.1479986837999605
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.	3.69489363187577
So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied.	3.2830728275592773
On the basis of a report, the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts.	2.468644600393762
Madam President, I want to express my concern that this clear defence by Mr Knörr Borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in Parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn, but collaborates with and encourages, violence against people and property.	2.479950300179355
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States.	2.8229401018905396
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	3.60451422134067
LIFE is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the Community budget, and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been stagnating for years. Despite the enlargement which has already taken place, when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second, despite enlargement, the level of appropriations remained the same.	2.834349225352447
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.	2.817292137357184
In this context, a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open.	2.9241462351141343
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.	2.0701758814942415
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then 'prohibition' .	1.8921706330000734
And these are the consequences!	6.749229219380413
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period?	2.5934201527081675
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	2.8971720135138823
In my Group, there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro' s report.	3.193431223106673
(Applause from the left. Heckling from the right)	2.2232006783846696
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown.	2.9307946197041206
The Commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine European policy on asylum and immigration. It wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime" .	3.127085188629202
I am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the European Parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties, in favour of sustainable urban development, involving at the same time this integrated approach, which we value, to handle the economic, social and environmental aspects simultaneously.	3.0091514046714707
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	2.4881911746854586
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.	3.511326881445933
It involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear, but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action.	2.1200012542966786
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.	3.8223210093945643
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one.	3.1870685390555864
Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira.	2.009582867485774
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress in the Syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of Lebanese/Israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on Israel's relations with its northern neighbours.	2.0798533869649543
The Commission must continue along these lines.	2.7967215955765723
We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions.	2.558053185415654
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	2.0022437586944255
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate.	2.6329655228178686
(Applause from the PSE Group)	2.2516470636649086
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason.	1.9289974123872689
My question therefore is this: will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions?	3.814242991075022
This is an unwise policy.	4.998069104470812
In so doing, it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which, in this instance, is awaiting clear, tangible action.	2.927469568811179
I will ensure that we go further than the rather dry terms of the Commission' s text and it will certainly be more a question of sharing the work than working in liaison with each other. I will also ensure that over the next two years we can coordinate the initiatives taken by yourselves and ourselves which will be separate but joint.	2.8173036424669493
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament, but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it.	3.863509201153083
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	2.979274136016547
Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media.	3.218701619464238
After the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Leader of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 February, the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.	2.73377433659322
We certainly do not want market organisation for forests, but maybe we should set up a system, perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector, which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way.	2.8897391514842012
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic.	3.1510338345602205
However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal.	3.5483006896336318
Gordon Brown, MP, meanwhile, has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel.	1.6319818371538217
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used, so creating uncertainty about the Commission' s attitude to the issue.	2.483960837284148
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	2.995330377018152
When it comes to tourism, we can no longer do what we like where we like.	3.238286053474884
My reply would be: a new start, a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the Union in the 2000s will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously.	2.7457483032474777
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter.	2.663391860562604
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others.	3.2496495597198516
The answer, of course, is an emphatic no.	3.5822155878098214
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty.	3.178769792690916
The important thing is for money to generate more money.	1.8474823869947554
I have to inform you, Commissioner, that both the report of the Wise Men and that of Mr van Hulten will become gauges for our group, gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the Prodi Commission or not.	3.386884192955004
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	2.0887615879265145
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion.	2.2062389636831288
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union.	4.179519406637303
Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets?	2.7247308724494723
Over the next seven years, the Commission' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit.	3.5170270129688714
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments, even if it goes against their interests.	3.597813042190765
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	3.1435052644764214
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights, for that would be the enemy of freedom, justice and security.	2.6941326145168145
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks, if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission.	2.4200579557014272
I do not know if Mr Monti is aware of the judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of last week, 10 February, which recognised the possibility of the German postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly.	3.1983827712313118
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details.	2.6385247327267987
Chancellor Schüssel' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima.	2.071159470675159
Otherwise, we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	3.626701709087845
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale.	2.7931530315063093
With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled.	3.7378730691868136
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training.	2.417229921252655
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	2.9634531423998474
The process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as 1978 but clearly the fact that the British Government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far.	2.610227092227432
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued.	2.836016753222948
	32.62528478497609
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.	2.5080914556647143
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.	2.5734464817536815
No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years.	1.8995116172560813
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	2.673881783676276
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which, although it directly impacts on the European Union' s development policy, is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum, it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives.	2.8730177671744146
It will be a force comprised of various national units.	3.41164045610988
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again.	1.63114318958219
As a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world, of which the EU is just one proof, and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our Western values, competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades.	3.6338110671332475
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.	3.298546108979296
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades.	1.939241078563312
Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development.	3.9779980307018876
Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations.	2.7110514395160625
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world.	2.4250233396724106
Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.	3.2436646555366
One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.	2.8054215836615857
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all.	2.4547119997784805
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	2.680738937689572
Mr President, the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union.	4.2121843906273435
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health.	4.328622726234713
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being.	2.906683059646012
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.	2.7552895501028374
So we need to do this.	6.345180327042728
We need to work.	24.210379295399097
In this sense, I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou' s proposals.	4.983480232433919
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme.	2.965748638155058
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	2.3933678214625305
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function.	3.168776062237519
However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle.	2.8465700784492496
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	2.6765957127943034
We need to get into that conciliation position.	3.7387522638262642
We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there.	2.839028328829635
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK.	3.342463052068352
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution.	3.339164196829801
Nevertheless, the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us.	2.841725332076337
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	1.7959729567325906
Nevertheless, I must make it clear that all these actions will, of course, have to take into account the principles agreed at the Helsinki European Council concerning applicant countries, so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.72500672693843
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	2.7686184006064067
The antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain.	2.0722233966920283
However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.	3.90723966813633
A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening.	3.013082920511482
In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption.	3.316313735791318
Unfortunately, developments are not moving in that direction.	1.9170889058264189
If the European citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being, if the mandate that our President, Mrs Fontaine has staked on a closer relationship between the Union and Europe' s citizens is to be effective, our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency.	3.5924918815215476
You must go further, towards reconciling the people with Europe, in particular those people who are falling victim to economic, social and, probably, in the future, technological divisions.	3.1005414919205583
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children.	2.053812454677636
Joint resolution on Austria	8.023808201827377
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets.	2.375474070660577
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services.	2.537444841388201
In other words, whenever I get the chance, I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text.	2.8933515124338114
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	3.0976965750778023
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat, when they met on Monday.	2.0370037765156486
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support.	3.2441657724059114
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	3.279509148473506
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives.	2.415580890168092
The maritime world has great potential.	1.4959305151168267
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development, environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure.	2.9888398562732146
I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will.	2.3106972787071483
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general.	2.7917089651828366
The same applies to labour market policy.	2.378140915955202
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement, as many other colleagues did.	2.643344574420035
For me personally at least, difficulties were caused by the directive' s technical division into two different proposals, which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject.	2.2560157202218147
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken.	3.0246766960213183
The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging.	3.2689890811797513
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument.	3.6952469201130356
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	3.505946675224669
The proposal for a directive was amended twice, first in 1997 and then in 1998.	2.893637888644715
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations.	2.9472038001660517
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure.	2.9224577250975563
Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol.	2.418014497173552
The second scenario, which we prefer: to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper, detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive.	2.594890404222347
I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK.	2.516568386650319
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	2.7229002146412853
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge.	2.4113436874998246
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11.	3.148974658029537
Then the war came, and the observers were withdrawn.	2.7486862766303277
As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules.	4.720278115475109
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	2.373793527827168
As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution.	3.2030426744483345
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	3.0121716021083604
I have had a little to do with this too.	4.2050111229282106
But that cannot be helped.	1.9610242504512292
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December.	2.3880614267690348
We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement.	3.2283317525606825
Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of "centre of the debtor' s main interests" .	3.996803427751064
The first is a policy of persuasion.	5.117721506436004
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity.	2.592812812691851
I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows.	2.550551234359376
I naturally hope that the result of today' s vote will be a good one.	4.767631425859197
I should like us to take a leading role in this work.	4.758127196219109
Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk.	2.2653233869823497
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union.	2.236599798833789
OLAF, the Commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent European public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts, criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the Union by Members and officials of the European institutions.	2.8019072672249417
I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task.	3.3172000134924864
Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions.	2.5717928727827437
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust, as proposed at the last Summit.	3.4562577737629625
I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time.	1.3705226330605234
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium?	2.02280760392107
First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive.	2.846316593275582
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, for their constructive approach.	2.849129225123696
Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure.	3.8584612905551823
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	3.38797415893186
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today.	2.91606436645177
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries.	3.3297117092216206
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights, which has now reached the drafting stage.	4.09047326411602
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	2.4137151626824216
Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.	2.9590699486647227
In addition, the Commission' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index, a so-called index fund.	2.267529851475911
Too little operational capacity upstream or, in fact, excessive use, can cause problems downstream.	2.180799280874844
Moreover, this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November.	2.8278312248556166
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular.	2.2853747557070028
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and, Mr President, with your permission, I will do this in English.	3.3306059826993977
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries, as well as European opinion.	2.3823619435374157
Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well.	4.501296950506817
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.	3.17011414335687
This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively.	3.0575793480251603
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth.	2.1669493534800868
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	3.092226795375151
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen.	3.4283980914077423
I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede.	3.5116220318798015
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent.	2.8319409058863623
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	2.9456423499676516
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner?	2.270195049217465
Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle.	3.835786861491415
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today, the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way.	4.261336061867362
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.	1.4043963999816018
Securing this is a major priority.	6.562022848104694
I would also like to stress, as many Members have highlighted, that human rights policy is at the heart of Europe' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the European Union.	3.1442294999409346
The Commission' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market is ridiculous, for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful squash or devour the weakest elements.	2.8636681398607293
In my opinion, the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future.	2.880039715787327
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations.	3.0390767219874926
The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing.	3.284643594748493
In any event, I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today.	3.4732340271056166
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe.	2.877616730544715
Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems.	2.28026026142221
This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina.	3.32560766218286
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry.	2.521566522579761
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations.	2.8657843869289152
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals.	4.3257906561451
The majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new Commission' s implementing a series of reforms, so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous Commission' s period of office is not repeated.	2.6394765041201804
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	2.347939635977101
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health.	2.6798825000038202
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems.	1.8524726132735447
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):	1.1672026996941478
These are difficult subjects, subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain.	2.037301740078917
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	4.809416750035685
Report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD))	2.1115530456726246
Mr President, I also rise on a point of order.	3.624095174090252
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	3.1711419999642567
. (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals.	3.4512978838531545
Madam President, I do not have a great deal to add on this subject.	5.073016637932212
The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance.	2.4836645093663265
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship' s sides mechanically.	2.275579418855449
This is an important aspect of this initiative.	5.961735078154026
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	2.7631056112275574
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked.	3.057153757521929
Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion.	2.9288822448878653
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject.	2.8127782196756663
That appeared in the communication published last July.	2.0992538450807703
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	2.6597524590627892
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	2.653533715219517
Madam President, I am amazed at Mr Corbett' s reaction.	5.418568894550327
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document.	2.160582671420535
Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading.	4.2581373582751985
The new legal framework will cover animal feed, animal health and welfare, hygiene, contaminants and residues, novel food, additives, flavourings, packaging and irradiation.	2.1191316051818205
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient.	2.739647499581416
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate.	3.5957072395461678
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	2.439951266577509
Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid.	4.749043693222143
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	2.8469131080975743
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC.	3.6609230985291314
The question which I therefore ask myself is this: has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area, how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence?	3.0753354804885875
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement.	3.2359630714823915
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs. Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.	2.4522443334606927
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind, not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner, but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted.	2.400212580431114
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities.	1.650195421753843
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending.	1.8646134186674164
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource.	1.708187374248083
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	2.5623524457207822
Yet we do not have much time.	4.402777246909025
This directive encourages the whole of this sector.	3.1757323919106066
Mrs Stenzel' s report has, however, turned out very well, at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned.	3.1412841594391794
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives.	2.427639544590079
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed.	3.6069679465534175
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	2.2498579008929136
I would urge you to endorse this.	3.0699767129263678
Moreover, given that this opinion is quite important, we can still vote for it, and indeed, the majority of our group will be voting for it.	4.061099418256354
The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7.	2.9789866674346377
End-of-life vehicles	72.17482167067989
Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was.	2.630742922751892
Allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which Mr Böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees, with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa, worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple.	2.631099689335135
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary.	2.515981519064559
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up.	2.0667726384200584
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise.	2.4183845475482197
This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	4.0086486864279
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	3.6108515110802086
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind.	6.255211308469047
The Court's report is there for a reason, our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through.	3.252290261278709
The "physico-chemical and ecological quality of water" was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals, and the adverse effects of other aspects was, at best, touched upon marginally.	2.862807948873891
Procacci report (A5-0025/2000)	1.0820706359717611
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	2.5864121794811634
We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	3.0508479384708074
Reread the letter: The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat, Article 6 of the Treaty.	2.997716873616785
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own.	2.51888212649149
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves?	3.6962800368445503
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	3.1164583205111214
The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations.	2.526218648844922
Now, the concept of "uniform harmonisation" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as "it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security.	2.4710961469294648
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision.	2.277321983290799
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention.	4.0042470754115405
What is a fair society?	3.295577679677249
The first is to establish equivalence, saying: in the final analysis, bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany.	2.5057396570652664
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members.	3.740736735123129
Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay.	2.8918312250382416
In fact, the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today.	4.192890388991593
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs.	2.77631944465805
In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN' s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen.	3.0552314932795506
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote.	2.511965980657645
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	4.069471525661492
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	2.4822054542227865
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media.	2.2135199112238593
It is easy to counterfeit the euro.	1.9853834586094878
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	3.0777842573624232
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode.	3.0956697705447747
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation.	2.825857358389556
That means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from Community legislation, as it should, but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years.	2.925910340107133
We are not doing a bad job of management.	3.0826738010956696
Over the past year, more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security.	2.0666426025362945
For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission.	2.9398031130529625
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	2.1483761562418064
I have rejected the entire directive, not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5/4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House.	3.115131244555763
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted, my Group will abstain from the final vote.	2.027013427784416
We need technical testing of ships, that is obligatory technical testing every two years, and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate.	2.3196710061412475
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version.	3.6035866398683933
There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe.	2.525337595812103
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities.	1.7846621486914722
Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment.	2.793953313585841
. (PT) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals.	2.647702779647091
However, in order to give this new approach some chance of success, the Commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal, a more simple and direct one, involving the NGOs from the outset, so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way.	2.824792940262037
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	3.171845066250863
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	3.1389843842691083
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	2.8414102951800517
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question.	3.9592183135316286
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	2.897072342251276
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	2.3837744825763676
I. the draft Council decision amending Decision 88/591/ECSC, EEC, Euratom establishing a Court of First Instance of the European Communities (5713/1999 - C5-0020/1999 - 1999/0803(CNS))	1.6854746419640871
Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied.	2.407141932058132
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	2.668225805650835
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many, many more decades than companies from Japan, Korea and elsewhere, that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere.	1.9260813158113124
Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them.	3.59226251535663
The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random.	2.834869699447512
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure.	1.5101348729430175
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	3.674147291814333
As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court.	3.5263196654909175
However, I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation.	3.0734233525149466
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning.	2.4916031207354212
Do not listen to the report' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed.	1.9937348781784618
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children.	2.5122943231233243
Deciding upon future policy lines, with a view to a new directive, rather hastily, without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners, I feel, runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators.	2.4875508350303206
We have set minimum requirements at European level, which all Member States and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses, especially when they are massive, or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers.	2.5495226497287833
I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason.	2.3407663907648573
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	2.4371659047964522
But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse.	1.8894838191516354
For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection.	2.4646566010273507
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000.	2.2407583299858245
I conclude, Mr President, by thanking the House for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, to the Committee on Budgetary Control and to the other committees which gave their opinions.	3.0997146025705185
I note, however, that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now.	2.822499507888285
We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates.	2.783763876051468
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them.	3.5482920176053874
In cases such as this, where there is uncertainty, simulators are used.	2.5398749500339246
However, to focus on the European Union as it is today, and on the subject of government and governance - a word which, at least in Spanish, brings to mind the previous name of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, although it may be an appropriate word anyway -, the most important thing is that the European Union be provided with a good government, and, since President Prodi always defends his home town, Bologna, I would advise him to go to Siena for a while and see something which we all understand: the frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which speak of bon governo [good government] and mal governo [bad government].	3.555499441241884
It is not to be brought in as a "sort of optional add-on" .	5.76952256273733
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	3.112796833299597
It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted.	2.9466362743568375
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	2.6377188871581936
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted.	3.8930187185312004
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested.	3.217296994419529
Madam President, my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.	2.3361453775442103
It is oil and diamonds which are financing the continuation of the war which, as has been said, is terrible. It has displaced millions of people and caused them to go hungry.	2.869784690839211
Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts.	2.8243999485420104
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper.	2.526335487703461
Now to the technical aspect. The safety factor in this type of project, and I am speaking as an engineer, has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty.	2.9089718128606687
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net.	2.9311075349623894
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin.	2.653709607868088
We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found.	3.108959351714624
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague, Michele Schreyer, to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning: "Reforming the Commission" .	3.183170567379601
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force.	1.8237960449848374
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today, bringing the European family a step closer together.	1.7140474568700175
At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.	3.1084649195839456
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	2.5096110616619063
They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.	2.3567136405717637
Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union.	2.524621650939404
There must, of course, be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups.	2.795159347230909
Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further.	5.751462593473027
The EU' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors, on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament' s analysis.	3.408488629947057
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern.	3.3317614243888234
Mr President, I would like to begin by emphasising, first of all, the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique.	3.61336844659054
The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries.	3.0047538698505925
They may, therefore, continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation, where there are no applicable European standards.	2.439443961446003
Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region.	2.1367711057101837
The chemical industry and, unfortunately, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance.	2.904688018141547
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	2.209387210611174
Mozambique, which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster, just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable, is excluded from these plans.	2.2581345404870943
As Mrs Randzio-Plath said, we must remember that the reason why certain Members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic, social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries.	2.9616241156257
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion, the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding.	3.214981203597588
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see.	4.596443037733389
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity.	5.342762073668606
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees.	1.8519973470227717
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.	2.374306845882551
However, having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees, I recognise that this was not feasible.	2.5826139918435707
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration.	3.649186312580286
In this respect, we are faced with the most sensitive issue: what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems?	2.9522714992695445
It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year.	3.2417247098996165
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve.	3.814056853971423
Most say it is about time.	3.24004024458116
Experience in other sectors show a sort of U-curve pattern: a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place, as, of course, the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive; then a second phase of steady employment, as new jobs in newcomer operators balance further potential employment reductions; finally, a third phase of net job creation, both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly.	2.2444782436668196
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	2.7997195610932475
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	3.168197863344234
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	3.8817071996359065
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights.	4.819614806903015
Madam President, Mr Prodi, how would you take stock of your policy and work programme, what would your benchmark be, if you had to make direct choices?	2.683292358500351
The Commission' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS, that is to say management companies.	2.9214807322712697
This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU.	3.854051582270291
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States.	3.052719585517656
More generally, those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various States of the European Union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy, devoted exclusively to the interests of big business, has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders, and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right.	2.458441019952781
Of course, the story of the Erika seems comical.	4.257483711542988
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies.	2.2260799478047404
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.5188712904074
AIDS treatments that may cost $18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $5 per capita.	1.5704884880762826
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	5.317244196940172
In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission.	2.923905290052121
The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice.	2.8773303054755086
It is, to a large extent, a principle of justice that imbues both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance, where, in particular, strategic coordination by the public authority is essential, even though it has been modernised.	3.306283027101192
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	4.58701795564855
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner, without any backhandedness.	3.1351852680475973
The Commission expects Member States to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming.	2.0166615384857893
Perhaps 'redundant' is the most serious epithet, and you are not responsible for this. It is the responsibility of this Parliament.	5.484918131186242
The second point relates to Syria.	2.6525583819064247
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China.	3.0692420486522987
Not a euro more or a euro less.	1.5898814472582565
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	3.474446350842022
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	1.9429372265035356
These include car manufacturers, second-hand car dealers, the federation of the car industry, the metal processing firms, shredding firms and the government.	2.2668175241836304
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider.	2.735853606297692
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.	2.4581902633916504
What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up?	4.429779828825562
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world.	4.711388833965374
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	3.650681849605057
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	1.6110775692536303
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks.	2.2269975915529776
This is something we have borne in mind.	3.7650052475793325
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive.	3.2641542006685893
Madam President, we are debating an extremely serious issue.	6.2423685140362775
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders. Consequently, you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration.	1.9264100496214147
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed, killing civilians is illegal by anyone's standards.	1.4223023186001291
Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe.	3.127403564941239
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement.	2.8945877885795475
I have taken note of your comment, Mr Speroni.	2.8041009831248247
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection.	2.4808496699687015
After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position.	3.8432295765721123
Not at all.	3.8089997751597138
Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	2.522431629570815
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question.	3.120851719100094
Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki?	3.087616832031954
Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger.	4.2081947091365715
Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy.	2.7409751066656054
The report also comments that in Greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges, or for the satisfactory use of European Social Fund resources to support employment policies, and, in addition, that there are no exact employment figures.	2.7996559309588216
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo.	2.320783203313954
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	2.208708851300016
In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority.	2.6439762839114676
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	2.9559682027369663
Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need.	5.763529650477083
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	2.0325885036887335
It is still the old imperial service.	2.944837815439287
Mr President, let us be clear from the outset: when it comes to cooperation, coherence is far from being the watchword.	3.5207403330813754
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation. This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish.	2.70774502175337
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report, it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation.	3.268297192581509
We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries.	2.334180167991493
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned.	3.705918244219939
In this emergency, in this ordeal, we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity: local solidarity, national solidarity, and intergovernmental solidarity.	2.3979132432989143
The public must have a right to clean water.	3.235463659091776
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community, wherever they take place.	2.0269843083566377
In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks.	2.7050140525073827
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars, but also cadmium, chromium, mercury and other very dangerous substances.	2.557985831330386
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen.	1.534716010047189
Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds.	3.8599925134138235
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed.	3.1909904827830875
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.	2.016144672361674
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	3.0306312739012355
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	3.377131566095181
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	1.9061030752041477
If the conclusion is that Turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal European safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.	2.436274014990199
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products.	2.667192237988109
Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	2.012786523267425
I will give you one example of this.	2.43046437357408
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	3.3268350986827127
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about.	4.180030953709616
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter.	2.2008244921006574
In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states.	4.08193085762177
If we do not take steps to deal with that, we will fail ultimately.	5.297366487188093
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol.	2.7635762700328663
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities.	2.3730623654532788
This is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the European Parliament or indeed to that of the Commission, which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and, what is more, widen it in the wrong direction, i.e. moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter European system.	2.8308157307621067
Yet these institutions have other seats and, given that the Community' s actions affect the whole Community territory, there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials, Commissioners and so on.	2.4900493916899813
Postal services must continue to be public services.	3.1717688615463318
Democracy, transparency and clarity always lead to results, citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on.	3.2077980101484997
In these circumstances, it is quite reasonable for this House to express concern today, asking an oral question which urges the Commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen.	2.6667348345719915
We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability.	2.550051779622816
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways.	3.6362643560867527
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia?	3.1974461216097034
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution.	1.7165072918947515
Let us take a very simple parameter: turnout at the next European elections.	1.7041512133342944
Mr President, Commissioner, we hope the agreement can achieve all its objectives but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in south-east Europe can be achieved without dealing with the very wide-ranging problems we are trying to eliminate.	2.837666503396423
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work.	2.9326367451857847
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	4.925752907899284
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI.	1.9920660872176639
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	3.2243449303245084
I hope that it works out.	5.179854062890762
Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment.	2.5077586930925846
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities.	2.8161599423213652
It would be appropriate, therefore, to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability, in both economic and social terms, of promoting the European tourist industry.	4.177565072321182
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months.	3.907265762230229
That, however, is not my question.	5.530874136272638
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	2.9451949194347127
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	3.5988389240262277
The moment of truth is approaching.	1.7250270810392085
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy, something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation.	2.434039446055343
Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan.	1.6577435538421752
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion, but I digress.	3.6844820214136167
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	2.404541988497502
We remain committed to eradicating the disease, an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector.	2.6895849538800096
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere.	2.743820678692759
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	2.3895482875380347
. As Mrs Wallström explained during yesterday's debate, the Commission is able to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13.	2.343465089041746
The time is now right, I think, to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation.	2.8308809911813775
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament.	2.5787154380191724
The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment.	3.198389139305449
From here on things are going to be easier.	3.2388331137035116
The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances.	2.985651123352479
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	4.382443864336228
When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish.	2.3808984520694896
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents.	3.993183091201446
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13.	3.239205053150197
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	2.7472838726971616
I think that this will be problematic.	6.089586893645051
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month, while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that.	1.9766362398936494
We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus is brought successfully into the European Union, and the decisions taken at Helsinki give an added dimension to this debate, with the acceptance of Turkey as a candidate country.	3.1946415313802676
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	3.130199257174499
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why?	2.0106110936428268
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	3.5838816487004466
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	3.552592260029525
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this.	4.7028358240106485
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	2.7312039593860473
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold.	2.1934546609287033
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	5.807044387483969
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	3.390723815268296
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.	2.1515009968619747
In addition to the objectives it is working towards, the strong point of the Community initiative INTERREG for the 2000-2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include new Eastern European and Mediterranean countries.	2.8857395817157556
We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage.	2.7606878996416557
Think of last year' s deadly criticism of the Commission' s lack of propriety, ethics and accountability.	3.3740939073459733
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	2.7235559454983154
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and/or environmental degradation.	2.206832908621537
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation.	3.6758222469878925
The postal service is also the bus service.	3.286830860709636
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper.	4.516289288090797
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented.	4.635998631288727
That is why we need transparency.	4.790517322228711
(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.5383858896294713
And just what is Mr CFSP doing?	1.7584144137532454
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	2.3403477105237895
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	3.1311352748746026
But would you, Commissioner, also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the Council you would report this to Parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you, with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress?	3.042297473302932
Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of this pivotal year, prior to the changeover to the single currency, the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment.	3.6476286591692464
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition.	2.4243328361755747
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	2.564240960355071
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas, and to show where, when and why, problems occur with coherence of policy, rather than sweeping it all under the carpet.	2.8321481456377717
. (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work.	2.3064189546729255
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.	4.598705688223177
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.	4.679450180840288
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field.	2.800010769097135
In other words, we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content.	2.766557180366084
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area.	2.1806289714105094
Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament.	2.9842547395265067
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC.	3.15835967970241
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	3.6523916037799884
In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional.	4.79503149209063
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	3.236454054266111
As the final text rightly states, actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities.	2.0015266468329918
This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.	2.635422393489648
All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services.	3.0995122349617565
The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without, at the same time, creating tensions.	2.8740103817825595
In saying that, we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with, but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service.	3.1242525405179227
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider.	2.2222147403464647
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and, therefore, to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy.	2.616492942626333
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria' s Freedom Party.	1.8986552504868082
Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way.	3.4410277628825825
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes.	2.7301020658728303
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	3.132016607664665
Thirdly, we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe, but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital.	3.2383081123421644
I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally.	3.575718559326113
We need, in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of Europe, to go back to the natural order of the universe, i.e. to the Creation, and beyond that still further, to the Creator' s intention.	3.376277681725425
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation.	2.1494309368667066
Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders.	3.0583163524050385
More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective.	2.401991047658616
In no case, however, are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature.	2.804520153582958
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	2.4125070368127233
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors, in particular agriculture, infrastructure development, the private economy and the strengthening of institutions.	2.53952358147748
The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur.	2.5509647374172544
So further thought is necessary.	1.5457968326871145
Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.	3.1446777993699833
This leaves it wide open to abuse.	1.3527324135502803
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time.	3.041375486721008
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	2.3872545532112257
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	3.190462859025031
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report.	3.952064494831256
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland.	2.225605492449442
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	3.2201471114783358
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs.	3.355238149387737
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue.	2.363433664433786
Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year?	2.867497712096343
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	2.1616031588364923
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market.	2.016691736073233
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.	2.5676853602787038
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.721778250204033
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed.	2.3934770879497735
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	2.9960315462176856
First, if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms, then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment.	2.085958948093705
Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases.	2.1666389652012876
During the months that I have been working on this report, one very clear demand has emerged, both from industry and from those who represent the consumer.	2.664333091795793
The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.	2.7693913066950184
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.	2.3328020939338865
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97.	1.4551453970573076
The comments contained within, under eight headings, are an integral part of the discharge, the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision.	2.6187688677693215
As far as possible, we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset, instead of having to be tackled separately and later.	3.282180094055482
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.	2.3657492119502677
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries.	2.5764999782500118
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations.	2.570339957765253
Crucially, reforms must not be limited to the Commission.	3.8123968758641684
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions.	3.1185234491448264
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	2.533693646565748
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	3.0448321915841965
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	3.222078313449966
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget.	3.2794167934632252
That is why, when we look at the EU Financial Perspective between 1989 and 1993, and 1994 and 1999, we find such a large proportion of the EU budget was put aside for the administration of the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund.	3.8097944971272404
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects, among other factors, the imbalances in our labour market.	2.0923680246021745
With the framework directive on water policy, we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU' s water legislation.	3.1677670013173875
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment.	2.7405798078396524
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.	2.561419640485168
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	2.1399780854181745
If the Union takes the initiative, this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world, including in the USA and Japan. A desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.	2.7501565650197803
This is inadequate, and I am personally delighted that Mr Barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which, moreover, I expressed when I told the press in Bordeaux what I am hoping for, and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of European civil security.	2.755645752501857
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council, for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis.	3.5122523744785297
First allow me to point out, Commissioner Byrne, that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative.	4.2518830632565
Although the Andersson report has gathered some positive proposals, including some that we put forward ourselves, we are still critical of some of the bases for the Commission' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection.	2.840848918484739
Firstly, I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have. Without it, institutions, business and the world of work could not function.	2.8391270622633935
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives.	2.7537579981290747
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7. It is quite simple: a special heading, namely, the famous heading 7, was created in Berlin, as part of the large Agenda 2000 package, for the applicant countries of Eastern and Central Europe, which are currently undergoing a process of transformation, and for these countries alone.	2.7576800815693656
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community.	2.689314803804787
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year.	2.888145199015461
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	2.083124227048559
Finally, there is the lack of transparency.	6.339725678849011
Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member.	2.7789742074224018
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here.	2.236353102145935
This infatuation with strand IIIC is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that 'the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co-operation' (p.17) and that 'the responsibilities are diffuse and vague' (p.18).	2.134765293546941
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto.	3.092920648080322
It is not easy to combine those aims. There is no obvious way.	3.2694109213130487
(Loud, sustained applause from the centre and from the right, protests from the left)	2.7437710905924457
We had Commissioner Patten speaking in this House in defence of freedom, security and justice and yet his report before the British House of Commons this afternoon, which has been accepted, will do away with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its reserves and put the people of Northern Ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists.	2.517186657784362
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme: the economy and quality of life.	2.3796323469503475
I would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some Ministers at the last Ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the Portuguese Presidency not to alter, in any circumstances, the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin.	3.0472283945018415
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days?	2.7429178130931557
Mr President, Commissioners, I greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-European cooperation under INTERREG, but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas.	2.8862285937362633
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion.	3.061638634425255
You are expected to ask questions, not necessarily make lengthy statements.	2.0435655934532932
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	3.4258789005358823
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	3.2785537759901953
In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market.	3.338662968054328
Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many.	3.2149265512086145
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission' s operations are clearly in no one' s interest.	2.5520735397851837
We cannot be accused of bad management.	2.3461573450072297
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes.	1.9275154060708095
However, if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs, this would clearly not be enough.	3.7050122697064123
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	2.237859651589559
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.	2.8841724404037863
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.	2.1280422141996547
Apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the Community market, what we term 'development aid' to the ACP has fallen constantly, from 70% of total European Union aid in 1986 to 30% in 1998.	2.6835768537092246
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union.	3.478497618091692
I note that Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base.	2.779324411900327
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice.	3.780101444323697
Mr President, the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union.	3.0464576897377187
Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed.	6.544739440099881
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, which we also understand.	2.65774257532361
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services?	2.7900413236949593
I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries.	2.839102055009463
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	4.569840919435569
The delta of the Danube is in danger.	2.725793952478944
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents.	2.4280033108878363
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action.	2.5091871500999794
Moreover - and Mr Miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round, even in my country, however densely populated it may be.	2.765862414025283
For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country.	2.3519536627692914
I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council.	3.2850803256002994
Indeed, the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up.	2.7605379073089398
Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage.	3.0277612319096807
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	2.5662276309291827
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations.	4.049593556504297
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day, but I suppose better late than never.	2.299084048414574
This could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs.	4.201129371818457
This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance.	3.3137617266182082
We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them.	2.645613335495186
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	3.789139668646392
Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has landed us in a major food crisis here in Europe, and I am afraid that once more I have cause to be angry at the fact that again no Members of the Council are in attendance, and that on the day that you present your interesting report.	3.655321639077864
And, in this regard, you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people' s social conditions, which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls.	3.0682487121695337
Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done.	2.329093091385895
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures.	2.74253735196336
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	3.9520112242395604
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency, then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market.	3.070594611835859
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.	1.6541834936851385
Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved.	2.5063376227629535
In the course of my speech, I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made.	3.162138606509307
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	2.4547883499486245
Firstly, I agree with you entirely. Account will be taken of the information society; that was something which I too mentioned.	2.924432588207205
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed.	5.073710642701334
Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located?	2.5475110541657093
China likes doublespeak.	1.2983976260958285
In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party.	2.2103653742191214
Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern.	3.509513773755404
They must be implemented without delay.	3.5045637317325915
The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda.	2.997860255553825
Such is life.	1.4989915111613579
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called "core tasks".	3.28558610550898
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention.	1.879955480977427
The very word bankruptcy, the legal concept of bankruptcy, does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union.	2.4951921004401156
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country's respect for and adherence to human rights.	2.0197839667374407
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course.	5.4862279717839435
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	1.9656527294504698
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity.	2.8052426752011623
First of all, I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned.	3.620280566762716
We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union.	2.6396887698305087
- (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no.	2.259459962639339
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues.	3.499999778004684
They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements.	2.5836111687037513
We have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive, in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the Commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms.	2.931840645750193
The following spring to mind in this respect: the systematic collation of documentation and information, professional forms of observation, the development of information campaigns, the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned, a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy, such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like.	2.3032125796556193
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	2.502993893992297
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece.	3.5422694602155143
That is important.	5.932996460098662
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy?	4.198490755610008
It is a very extensive report.	6.628338579698102
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	2.1229976383408857
Mr President, all I can say about 1999 is this: how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter.	2.904138498975835
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	2.3081993821114835
My question to the Commissioner is this: what is to be done?	5.765983412380979
And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community.	3.076271568577553
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva.	3.082540050359461
It represents a step towards the area of freedom, security and, particularly, justice to which we all aspire.	3.1780679825094396
If the Commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards, no one doubts that it would present it without delay.	2.296028495547361
However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions.	3.3029859811292748
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States.	2.4703577748212706
I want to see civil society given a louder voice.	3.4991627823423874
I hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the Tampere Agreements on immigration and the new Spanish Act on aliens. In particular they must ensure that people arriving in Europe do not lose their dignity.	2.4642896179012963
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	3.700757935745571
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment.	3.7945428854127385
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now.	2.6022386377295703
I sincerely hope that, in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the Middle East, all the key protagonists will move forward quickly, in the very near future, so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved.	3.7168397409575173
Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies.	2.15978020112222
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.	3.750506352009355
The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to.	1.907656450389004
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy.	3.5367604002511177
In other words, when EU commercial interests are concerned, poverty considerations go out of the window.	2.8126872355294634
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.	3.3103755725789585
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	3.180406112574116
Despite having signed these international agreements, this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that Europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened.	2.3587834910206134
It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives.	3.3058093816751843
I hope that Europe, in terms of social protection, will make a step forward, taking into account subsidiarity, for without subsidiarity, this would not be possible.	3.743767411755867
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people' s health and the ecosystems.	2.0620363746102957
The members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the Commission proposal which they would criticise: firstly, for example, the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities; secondly, the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the Commission and thirdly, the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the Commission and the technical assistance bodies.	3.0660661923007844
Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it.	4.185959728762291
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	2.0911898551800285
This is important.	7.662589930121881
Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years.	1.6139023907417633
In congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work, we can but hope that the Commission will duly take into consideration the proposals Parliament has put forward, in accordance with the commitments made under the Code of Conduct on the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm, with fitting amendments, the transformation of this Community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries.	2.92138596988589
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	2.4559365768365105
What I said and what I explained in a previous answer is that there are civilian targets linked with structures which are objects for military action, and you know as well as I do that some military actions not only go for military targets, but also for civilian targets and structures which are connected with military action.	2.5624599866818816
If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany.	1.8029530455218583
The ECB, ECOFIN, Europol, OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation.	2.4098563126929977
I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries.	4.3561874888488905
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment.	2.1066922226784928
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it.	2.372382000760627
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	2.0527902946078167
She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done.	2.7286802309589615
Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner.	4.662060244380327
(Sustained applause)	1.2755494614019365
We are to get the agendas.	4.866705276785386
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility.	3.378163382632528
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival.	1.5877565986639977
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	2.8868067371809247
Mr President, I voted for the Decourrière report on the Community initiative INTERREG, mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers. I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too.	2.7123196855091622
In view of all this, I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism.	5.265102511110863
This requires internal stability.	1.4314103662703253
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people.	2.2492523015288515
(FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world.	2.602843874639565
But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market.	3.883396746437865
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	3.127984303358885
Well in simple economic terms, Europe' s culture adds to genuine prosperity.	1.801073975667879
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated.	3.2875535578279624
We believe we have respected that commitment, and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission.	2.286377830478824
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	3.7483668626312445
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question.	2.3738250295421266
We are not talking about words here.	3.1521978231628762
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims.	2.8056921529400567
That is the way it should be.	10.624843470237511
As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied.	3.733920511526625
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House.	2.947805185354658
It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital.	2.5924204653344893
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	2.1690113781326597
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.	2.749467210568835
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	2.8528609873382034
It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property.	3.1772612839121863
Ten years ago, the "velvet revolution" proclaimed Havel na HRAD.	4.177005423094937
In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity.	2.7630676255282007
What has become of it?	1.8094757380900848
However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries.	3.265760792617079
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts.	3.196543298715203
It is more a question of nine minutes, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects, not nine months.	2.524007336463105
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic, social and environmental sectors.	2.689225579435183
During the few months that I have been a Commissioner that has happened twice, first of all in New York at our meeting with Minister Tang and most recently at the meeting in Peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest.	2.767940624226524
Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot.	5.021066776620026
What I would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind, whatever name it goes by, will be given influence over the Council, who in this authority will have the say in matters, and who will issue orders.	3.0512241116071452
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion.	2.069977407427237
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	2.5732946751839125
This is good, but it is not enough.	3.2581287106581565
This model function also applies to regional cooperation.	2.500209050233367
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget.	2.5607113067683516
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	2.276579502222239
When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	2.425559840455605
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary.	2.767079145666894
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	1.903275403064609
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is, so to speak, ambiguous and unique?	2.8844538780317324
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years.	2.515720224890043
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms, working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm.	2.135039155084857
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer.	2.8216370596872404
Resumption of the session	1.7491832698293113
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them.	2.6645959869653804
The European Union did that at the European Union­China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues, including Tibet.	3.437236562465766
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.	2.306345975464599
This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction.	2.411878681360658
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales.	1.97439838495214
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice.	2.532417737497137
Mr President, international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State, but the evidence for which is to be found in another.	3.544282809991351
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	3.051402789207943
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	3.45684233206662
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	2.1779098927622
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused.	2.8745703905067415
We insist on this.	1.8421288550551007
In welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new EQUAL initiative, it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular: physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility, visual information systems which exclude blind workers, working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems.	1.9678663243022008
Indeed, we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe.	2.8085788527787976
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility.	2.3203807881378444
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe.	3.2925464058849316
That too is feasible.	2.0005467766854568
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one, for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy.	3.9039157250955676
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter.	3.2494340214084
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the European Union' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully-fledged Community policy on tourism, increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs.	2.805954296424226
It also has excellent cultural and relational links, through twinnings for example. INTERREG III, strand A, would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium-sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer.	2.518664811879639
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe' s economy.	2.2323774646479704
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	2.6702748225647586
Permit me one further comment. Although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm, the tanker disaster off the French coast has made it very clear that we need to give the Commission a helping hand on another matter.	2.554178321500311
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea.	3.0488532004540705
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again.	2.1829427491829128
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched.	3.1652053441814094
All these factors have unfortunately been accumulating over time and are now allowing those who are cruel, intolerant, racist and destructive, of which all our countries have some examples, but thankfully a minority, to light the fuse of xenophobia.	2.704052301649869
I believe that today' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors.	2.9674042327123735
On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds.	3.2528864885213014
They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours.	2.4429145268711676
After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour.	2.944194265843185
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people.	2.0732511672259304
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do.	3.4906896665558302
I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions.	2.869283190331883
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.	3.1941610849744038
This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort.	2.6537087308596186
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well?	2.0354506805674806
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic.	3.115056084539713
The European Union voted against that motion.	5.2395593040157
Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999)	1.288342709821954
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons!	2.4808512359575112
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions, primarily criminal, applicable in all the countries of Europe, against offences of this kind.	2.6386751040809404
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	2.542842379454758
Fishing and the environment (Bergen 13-14 March 1997): 2nd report	2.3001171250709627
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement.	1.8707158975905445
It is not something, I assure you, which I would wish to make a practice of.	4.943755069886922
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships.	2.1878460066390004
Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits.	2.2572112856049626
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	2.4328810065757156
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.	2.8288146950094766
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	3.787349158649537
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	3.592483233448373
What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians.	3.035575055875726
It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union.	3.888919784248404
Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed.	1.7487552032953317
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas, giving it worldwide scope.	2.0710925616225637
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	2.8145876056939394
Here in this House, in Spain and in many other countries, we have all fixed on El Ejido. Yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening, not only in El Ejido, but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment.	2.653545897987729
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	3.697506796727439
However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute.	2.1844576325283396
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU, while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions.	2.388446065412253
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was, rightly, the establishment of this type of tax, and this is not by chance.	3.9190226543454356
The Union, like everyone else, has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation.	3.453197041981519
As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately.	2.5427062488896865
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	2.385082504903963
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries.	2.3012056111737778
When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say?	3.2519293849063198
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	2.645462829355409
If a company in France says that it has an employee who has to work in Denmark on a permanent basis, and only in Denmark, then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for Denmark.	2.7611252152393617
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions, in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered.	2.1450774164549213
Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme.	1.6969845169047626
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	3.5701338868417016
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	2.666105467856267
In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked.	2.029638838126571
The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations?	2.896867476621789
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	2.337616776002286
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern.	2.780147123956513
And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this.	3.3379878705454384
It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned.	3.1622085262143176
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.	2.667903441482916
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	2.7711693991124293
In addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the Member States: greater financial flexibility between strand A and strand B. Thanks to these two overtures, especially the first, I can say that the Commission is willing to examine the case of Italian regions and regions of third countries around the Adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under INTERREG, and with other instruments too, as soon as they become available.	3.230231308709409
Therefore, our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete.	2.6483584401251337
I must not go on about books, but I have just been reading the book by David Landis Barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues, in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies, going back millennia.	2.516115962118191
Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible.	2.022640438247109
With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application.	3.376906723589425
The Commission can also accept Amendment No 4 in principle.	4.263811443469853
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war.	2.7541239386207534
I look forward to receipt of that document, which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue.	3.031892092812604
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	2.2368061889517956
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening.	2.333105804276999
For this very reason, we cannot agree to cut pensions further.	2.9001284672385714
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage.	3.561017535979198
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women.	2.2008136950359902
I am particularly pleased that my own country, Ireland, is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability.	3.4001918368883164
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe.	1.8139839080979243
Mr President, committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary, but not amendments from individual Members.	2.788721141717491
Are you prepared to act upon it?	1.809006405331057
Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable.	2.096346897419804
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	2.343259665182489
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense.	2.956875211154725
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	2.513873642709584
A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable.	3.1044206044580043
Mr President, I have a few very brief comments.	5.417509873490183
From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean.	2.585019464016162
I do not believe so.	6.539329044594542
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid, trade and finance.	2.56206287181586
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future.	3.240339274491714
I also welcome the Commission's communication.	6.23468068101342
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	3.7900847830500637
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	3.777078971552822
But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	2.284880278476961
Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided.	2.7742661998889524
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	3.1386962869945423
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	3.0277199109336705
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust.	4.658599241829674
I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	3.2540304515881564
(Loud applause)	1.1492569002612767
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission.	2.7819402261004913
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.	2.1123592638990467
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components.	3.0735855374876637
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	3.1187366328807835
One can quote from the communication.	1.9182531382045047
- (PT) Mrs Korhola, as you will understand, I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply.	4.250984753151827
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed.	2.934024294543636
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE	2.434306937842865
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President.	1.8915240970636993
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis.	2.536741300618396
I would just like to underline this - the situation is, of course, a little precarious - Parliament has, for the sake of convenience and safety, placed the EQUAL programme on the back burner for the time being, so that Parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed.	3.084591258125112
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective.	2.480514036877603
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	2.584612075367321
These are the main reasons for my vote.	3.291338742721229
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol.	2.8289685277045447
After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies.	2.2962322695436326
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions.	2.665396123767128
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative.	3.327674393424299
I would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed, firstly, in the case of URBAN, at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various European cities, and, in the case of INTERREG, at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly by including the outermost regions in strands B and C.	3.1990319566529695
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand, and vice versa.	2.5980599913103295
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies.	2.625487479492756
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament.	3.7114721580845345
In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction.	3.0453565953926494
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission.	1.98143997938284
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose.	2.2097260193125865
Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual.	2.3564574307641646
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations.	3.7200014427855863
But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control.	2.478339465151708
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities.	1.9724996924052163
However, I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal. It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves.	3.8726855543488132
Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez.	6.441331123081047
For these are prerequisite to any development.	1.832843426638546
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures.	2.741326039187831
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee.	3.6269857944569677
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	3.374079389553353
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory.	1.7213184273535216
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy. Time and time again, good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented.	2.5262941868519184
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary.	3.9645557910194005
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	2.1034315958428076
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime.	2.9103863606852984
For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable.	3.562298253877452
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar, a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar.	2.3298945484245834
Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle.	3.460260052252649
It is essential that we get the mix right.	3.24505962271683
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court.	3.7616891561783716
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería, it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred.	2.357231023013191
In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.	2.5305856514729363
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	4.400922827198843
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions, since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions.	2.287114902185689
At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded.	2.7095163729492264
Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report.	5.8767424605681295
Madam President, Commissioner, I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question.	2.6588131072877754
Question No 31 by (H-0795/99):	1.2605856117352525
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999, the Commission' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council.	4.0958954767059925
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.	3.251483091809004
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget.	3.11463070308378
It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken.	2.8409577702698448
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations.	2.3255103560466064
When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged.	3.5691894937242825
The other concerns the collective investment undertakings.	2.2628968427175318
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO. This was intended to be proactive and, using a regional approach, to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population.	2.564878104974979
In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally.	2.130528564544369
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently, I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected.	2.829112206432254
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side.	2.781567089573155
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen.	1.7537072534619254
There is as yet no federal European tax.	1.6010177593726604
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	3.6644661526441937
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	2.078655805955895
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	3.387328134887702
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation.	2.8268018546275275
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments.	2.547962873118572
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility, the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible.	2.532216591914097
The same is true with regard to immigration policy.	3.4450642737525548
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	3.1209790953607075
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis. Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work.	1.981153518133057
The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio.	2.499523158045978
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.	1.535189456779017
It will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular.	3.0220290405210317
In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?	2.719360940893145
They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.	2.6171866236428447
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive.	2.6318763451044243
Undoubtedly, reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer.	4.289311963842121
However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government.	3.332207659516698
The vote will take place on Thursday.	2.0695879598998657
However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority.	3.0278493012209875
We all agree that, after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, certain action must be taken.	2.210427309968741
The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.	2.706081364094843
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict, tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective.	3.1073157733717522
Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right.	3.2161466464548027
Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans.	2.485738116146043
We went ahead because we felt we should start this Parliament in the way in which we mean to go on, that is, by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in Europe.	3.079696841595053
Question No 38 by (H-0805/99):	1.2605856117352525
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	3.278445968939483
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union, despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world: these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote.	3.9394335923582573
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments.	2.7861570785082383
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework.	1.5077712537665493
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission.	3.060823930290035
The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!	2.7536587622059114
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties, because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself.	2.5764183756548458
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47.	2.8759422041724982
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks.	1.844506019083842
We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime.	3.643654158818608
This is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of Europe was clearly recognised, i.e. by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty.	2.5418184300502213
Our rapporteur' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded.	2.104075628875021
It must be visible.	6.172601270126647
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	3.2013083286740907
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be.	2.2079446861250465
In any case, the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing.	2.502212366473545
We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you.	1.7871695319729857
In promoting cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory.	3.0161723957121107
Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism.	2.2812363087793464
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	3.11563098941971
Moreover, this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well.	3.5196752665419857
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	2.7929433004235675
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies.	3.3618714376632948
However, in the future, the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market.	3.2268972031992136
Mr Haarder, to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing.	1.9409048769984791
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed, where, similarly, a great number of European employees were involved.	2.718896649187437
Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children.	3.073364993003447
What you just said is absolutely true: people want more engaged democracy.	1.6143022715685245
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.	3.3149954587186596
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation.	3.5636007647638683
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market.	1.9959275092697057
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies.	3.9167126711359295
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM.	2.337820129666633
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	1.6446928515851367
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.847771585005342
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	2.2613615627880352
Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected.	3.639337513099608
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	4.192990459379018
On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.	3.926945420233067
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us, have been expecting from us rather too long.	2.0883781740770644
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation.	1.5797349114304131
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States.	3.9058694752887915
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	3.2719294102691716
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream.	1.8161587556114105
I thank them for their statements to the House.	2.4385881111269905
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province.	2.4890723406693924
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for the second time within the space of four months, we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe.	2.844192601458341
He has fewer than 2 000 officers, and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000.	3.179277242532046
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us.	2.7316889705198903
We do not want Africa to become our cross, in fact quite the contrary.	3.4945946279625093
Nevertheless, given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction, this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion.	3.5756327694602175
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies.	2.3552553523765614
I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members.	3.616012752299852
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise.	3.0856647915631505
However, even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management' s attitude is socially irreprehensible.	2.207501176193893
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.	3.7205721366992095
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year.	2.81509229818629
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations, which is a delicate and sensitive phase, by exploiting tensions.	2.5339070669178994
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	4.723320634558502
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	3.3040373111471064
We must therefore find a political solution.	3.1270124704430966
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed.	3.0618699946993058
In October 1999, following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II, the Commission decided to extend the initiative.	3.509406640754889
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.	3.404265190145421
Before the vote	2167.680339251355
Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.	2.758282121718134
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced.	2.3052095599835027
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day.	2.2831562355177564
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view.	2.8000161940331996
With regard to costs, I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about.	3.7815986767400336
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.	3.221303685334633
Finally, this House must tackle the phenomenon of immigration with sufficient calm to avoid increasing tension in a debate which must go much further than the appropriate words and condemnations prompted by such behaviour.	2.112311367178711
We should be aware, for example, that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil.	2.986373842357516
This is the price of the future of generations to come.	5.05214574244008
The officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis, that is, in the operational Directorates-General, amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money, so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming.	2.569791233737664
Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children.	2.89838174488037
Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict.	2.3662475034075636
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	2.911036195600673
My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand.	2.3413929956268063
Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.	3.4334855812993923
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them.	2.505755419656743
Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state.	2.6899598531745816
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe.	2.187054715363136
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension.	2.439558213717979
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche.	3.5571954819758282
They are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather, on the basis of our social model, to be able to organise globalisation.	3.1091003022678114
In the Sunday papers all over Greece: the Ministry of Public Works concerning the structural fund: the Minister' s work; the Ministry of Agriculture: the Minister' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the Ministry of Telecommunications: the work of the Minister for Telecommunications; the Ministry of Education: the work of the Minister for Education and a photograph of the Minister; the Ministry of Employment: the work of the Minister for Employment, a photograph of the Minister and a photograph of the State Secretary, and behind them all the symbols of the Community Support Framework.	2.3247817960887858
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business.	2.3504480291251766
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	2.6303995575539676
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU.	3.378920275462065
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are.	2.764154477116858
Local politicians cannot do that, once legislation has been passed in Brussels.	2.401132193761053
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution, but against the granting of discharge.	2.9505278595098305
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation.	3.712077065758243
It is true, once again, and I accept this objectively, that there are still real legal problems.	4.308529445053496
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform.	1.8188923941687958
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions.	2.430499786419181
(The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.)	2.2095016925723105
It must be known.	10.120596038914302
The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	3.3418738753224377
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	4.144289758146611
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	2.6091004792451153
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	3.6857126336623964
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both.	1.5662378738949492
I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less.	2.802892862081506
In the fifth place, we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the European Union, and incidentally, that includes the candidate countries.	2.98512175388142
The directive affords a European framework, also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these.	2.9873039433130404
It should not be the case that one Member State, under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle, can decide that all funding should go to one group.	2.995835426958285
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought, nonetheless, to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection, irrespective of which country they live in.	3.5489520007220516
As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day.	2.7592661169973187
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means.	1.584269916133968
And there is no sign of this trend' s being reversed.	3.6534636957115194
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission.	4.06786391769249
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.	2.372289030570774
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	7.207287541179352
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector.	3.2462142830616787
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	3.4140145687587213
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.	2.417461964169103
But we also say: we want to defend this European Community of tolerance, which is why a common foreign, security and defence policy is so important.	3.6599012138806986
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together, under your guidance particularly, in the course of these few months, which is extremely important.	3.991017738178943
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	3.4473284738257184
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	3.6104032558718586
Moreover, although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice, I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations.	2.7906586188167792
As you requested, I have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the Commission on the service outsourcing systems.	3.2620083102533677
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	3.357515679586763
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	3.1565793414694183
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	2.612097022626788
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities?	2.6106204701726323
The Member States can devise their own systems in the social sphere, each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences.	3.261172305843027
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.	2.2465466468883966
This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States.	2.7488038549439895
In addition to the proposals for a new European food authority and an enhanced control system at Community-level, the White Paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the Community's legislation, covering all aspects of food products from farm to table.	3.0394356383056174
I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States.	3.2050796196044002
Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment.	4.61304715791777
In my opinion, the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process.	3.7058842127408367
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled.	2.6188882071854054
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect.	2.358241117778868
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	3.164824828241775
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.	3.875275420393582
Mr MacCormick, first of all, I would like to answer your comments.	3.168888271748639
When that time comes, when we have used up all our resources, I shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources, but what I am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources, we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on.	3.082095313603633
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent.	3.8897948609722057
The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all.	1.8589185397748071
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light.	1.8126915119954121
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe.	2.7645339276619847
Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint.	3.319377422118773
The European Union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country.	2.4786853739718473
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	2.7856749426673857
We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations.	2.0123542971891495
However, with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies, the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage.	2.668746222429779
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	2.2947708583945006
I may have missed it in the list she gave out.	2.5342777806084276
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	3.060131807404948
The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance.	3.1273296520143785
Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice.	2.7345882496829934
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive does indeed, as many speakers have already said, represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the jumble of piecemeal EU regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe.	2.8699066985124904
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together.	1.8093117709814242
'No freedom for the enemies of freedom' was what the advocates of the revolutionary Terror were saying two centuries ago, the advocates of the revolution which proved, alas, to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes.	2.2911995198444925
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	3.3310595169958126
(IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	3.5677680948718224
It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions.	2.5836655156268487
All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business.	2.6296347945123073
I am glad to see that the hope Mr Swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in March, i.e. that we will finally have an EU delegation there and that we, as the European Union, will finally have a greater role to play there.	3.300023129867322
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	3.557145135378982
We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe.	2.23746839130228
However, the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper.	2.8446989198298267
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment, there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation.	3.4969428575447887
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	2.129775998432003
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks.	1.8973089544926016
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	1.0820706359717611
With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job.	2.3686899327835076
Indeed, it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too.	3.0774929534860007
I would remind Members that, according to the guidelines for these sittings, questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer.	2.558433163984163
The "Erika" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe.	2.3356218312396084
(The Minutes were approved)	1.756278663472402
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan.	2.8249486922571965
There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part.	3.267475051929451
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	3.169423459581586
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	2.6180621476716723
In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too.	6.178581377339835
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	3.1379849388432133
I do not know whether this is in order, and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House.	3.1700008850661954
In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above.	3.0260408406961448
Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace.	2.6254785587162077
The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available.	3.143485921619158
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed.	3.0626509887370736
What is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process, which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences, should have the will and the know-how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse.	2.9591970242342227
Now I believe, Commissioner, this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken, otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past.	3.0002155843897698
The two proposals form a coherent whole.	2.032677421389
Parliament has taken due note of your comments.	2.870280556817014
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	2.194172649406996
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	2.873404255005862
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me, is not enough, in practical terms, to allow any type of project to be carried out.	2.8264048767395273
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project.	3.9159124664367515
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	2.7383237870145374
This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	2.5276896978295613
- (FR) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods.	1.980956967099956
And so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues: firstly, comitology, an ongoing debate within this House, but Parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the Commission some flexibility and which do not give the Council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the Community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the European Parliament.	2.3072857571611336
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	2.6842683583039912
It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge.	4.0553992465121045
I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever.	3.2801423567516164
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it.	2.5019563777750595
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis?	2.719820103159863
We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand.	1.943299053641534
Many speakers have underlined this.	2.7058174705562745
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.	2.6738453418669437
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making.	2.3618371751762512
But I should like to stress the fact that, on this issue of the environment, the budget issue is a central one and Parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal.	3.8016957246206693
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	3.0342398858695265
Everything that I have just said, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account.	3.498157152650688
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	1.9283282463977127
There may be a number of views on that.	5.14091768948958
. (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision.	3.7021111044472126
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	2.980433001331447
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.	3.6137165589627274
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection.	2.9702101705798043
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	1.7884054903598334
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage.	3.950530248485426
I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families.	4.015588474584579
Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference.	3.0860899543599283
I wish to discuss two matters.	3.4434786679137273
The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	3.6025352386469005
In effect, this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management.	2.2178146368212817
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved.	2.450144540692547
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	4.2091839995278235
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	1.8299911462464873
Is this actually how we want things done?	1.5096783658597253
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.	1.5817471027410308
This kind of tourism, which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens, is just as important.	3.6005654541523744
Relating to Wednesday:	1.2258564250053974
I noticed that the Commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the Commission, but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been.	3.212183649696351
At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it.	2.4543740559830067
It did not work; poverty became worse than ever.	2.0995442037989194
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	2.821245153198357
It is better to do it absolutely properly.	2.895984029371812
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time!	2.733165896357969
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union.	3.2153067914100073
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member, but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted, and every single one of those requests has been met, and met with alacrity.	2.7828279605437913
Mr Alavanos, I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited.	3.0713897421043086
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta.	3.325615835472035
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.4371500606954688
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	3.807566781152081
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament.	3.9838254869162806
The Labour Government' s record in Britain is also a proud one.	2.019544087650004
There is an immense risk of exclusion.	2.6967913337675578
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40%, as proposed by the Commission, has been very greatly watered down by the Council, to between 5 and 10%.	3.3978244901987154
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference.	4.60716434639045
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.8384467724761684
To support this statement, I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague, Mário Soares, in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans.	3.3905723274499184
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.	3.3201644989083845
You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited.	1.7838745175145416
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	3.1808844652251826
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report.	3.2060678581377244
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity.	3.4988395605137756
It is nothing less than legal torture.	2.1854920967323928
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement.	1.904073697881657
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started.	3.316434702229088
I salute Mr Schmidt.	1.5462433181986768
This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3.	3.1240083627025275
The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties.	3.454692437854749
But for the internal market to work effectively and for the single European currency to be a success it is important that all regions within Europe, of which there are over 100, can economically compete within this very challenging environment.	2.983074837593425
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.	2.768290607444275
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	3.2051285703583474
However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present.	4.048167135661889
In the limited time available for this statement, it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals.	3.067418736359034
We are clearly, once again, returning to enlargement, which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security, peace and freedom.	2.8126334955348007
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	1.6868247427177703
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.	3.5148983166145755
It also contains four calls to the Member States which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist-oriented SMEs, particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments. These would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively, such as the tourist sector.	2.6210078089788706
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment.	2.3658334584378213
On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.	3.452937175073387
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000.	3.3749943611650646
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful.	3.490632527961778
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on.	2.647724682466296
We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason.	3.6584020043078453
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject.	3.354118450696687
Women should not only be "half of heaven" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet.	2.683589938571215
Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe.	4.34763978462452
That is naturally unacceptable.	1.517387925117565
Finally, if the Treaty needs to be amended, how do you think this amendment will be implemented, following the report to be submitted in Feira? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting?	3.140394965560787
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation.	3.497940355676169
More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs.	3.387035397089171
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability.	2.784175019971342
Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it.	3.158961481323287
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	2.5978584404289413
Today' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed, not speed at the expense of quality, but then slowness alone does not mean quality either.	2.338009911937951
In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity.	1.7767849466870058
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner.	2.788591900928995
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation.	3.5130813913484773
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public.	4.13612499007472
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development.	2.6446433112681764
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	2.8323620451364104
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened.	3.101952265116763
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	2.5615329144963073
Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors.	2.714514178363891
Bearing this in mind, I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter.	3.0123076495547694
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points.	2.8986472714375653
Mr President, I am sure the Commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which, as you are all so very well aware, led to the forced resignation of the Santer Commission.	3.3298358721147676
Nevertheless, I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within.	3.1336377591600146
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	3.0774567263528376
You have not integrated it anywhere.	2.596941965902659
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	2.0659936952168363
The cost is not insurmountable; nor is the task an impossible one.	2.009420775375802
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget.	2.3283365468011437
We can clearly and almost clinically see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it originates from inside or outside the Community. This is why we have proposed the creation of a European public prosecutor who could, having investigated a case from start to finish, then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court.	2.154946238458304
Resumption of the session	1.7491832698293113
In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately.	2.1932700758609833
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality.	2.4109698462247433
Europe must therefore lead by example to some extent, both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, including its groundwater, surface waters and seas.	2.1792943272100946
Nevertheless, these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union, despite its well-known human rights violations.	2.005469876688855
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time.	1.9206563240196268
As Budgets Commissioner, here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.	2.2675797866607357
We also face difficulties with regard to offences.	3.0114199465999403
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development, it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way, and this is unacceptable.	3.5916897371438163
There is a limit to how useful that is.	3.320384556916157
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well.	3.1116535525662514
After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	2.003802500962084
I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group.	4.666271691406721
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union.	3.537552445010663
. (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	2.730419164629758
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture.	2.304498272917512
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned.	3.0741802966335476
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU.	2.2523929148225004
There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.	2.6395184909277813
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth, whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening.	1.7260597403620581
The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation.	3.4623335983734878
It is up to the Commission' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach.	3.4847778782807337
What is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the Vlaamsblok, one of the most important parties in the Flemish region, if tomorrow the Belgian Parliament adopts the implausible, indecent and ignominious bill tabled by its main political rivals, the Volksunie, which seeks quite simply to abolish the party?	3.1978269425860204
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities.	2.6095479920087574
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union' s being able to function come what may.	3.4302597955841807
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lomé Convention, which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today: a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect.	3.016546060866734
Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.	2.6861624653226
I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility.	3.3088813067143783
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this.	2.777791640246675
Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe.	1.9745721009032504
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia.	1.9526944069582868
However, I believe that there are also some elements of consensus.	5.228287827980844
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)	2.010775655360771
As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure.	3.3103523966427866
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal?	2.460766033967492
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences.	4.398211179140353
I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power.	3.119418005056227
Why, in these circumstances, is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised?	3.2081815482150744
- (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	3.799809816289033
I propose that we start the debate immediately.	2.5575728781998093
So be it. But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies.	1.7697404854019492
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals.	1.611094625723006
At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system.	1.8508992196244256
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	4.407454488279714
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political.	2.992068266320779
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	2.1892064508768323
However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure.	3.097049501429609
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it.	2.8238554565654868
The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration.	2.6036945428932126
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.531277521076661
The INTERREG initiative, launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations, sits comfortably within this philosophy.	2.274108178782472
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	2.4917753708420625
We are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the IGC precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the Portuguese Presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the IGC be widened.	3.108911365182525
Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that "it is happening within their own nation" .	2.3881105540754413
Therefore, I do not believe I need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas, factors which are on the agenda, and I would like to say to the Commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect.	3.6357917550377263
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear.	3.8474565675888717
The overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong, honest European public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels; an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential.	2.3583419897660387
Especially in the southern Member States, the tourist industry is a major source of income.	3.8803846013105434
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom, security and justice.	2.5739816827151674
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision.	2.8207306634542193
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission' s disposal, but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them.	4.0744815511059205
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.	2.504169558486091
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence.	3.664075007178017
In three weeks' time, I shall be in Paris, and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another.	2.9204806964364156
Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday.	2.469486115069782
In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity.	2.3308356578004243
The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	2.5075449410105977
And, for want of appropriations, we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop.	2.0765164396065536
The common position is a reasonable compromise.	5.401506295791338
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect.	2.976381617227233
Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context.	3.349825392280622
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	2.7448548360975615
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.	2.859070000778331
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2%.	2.0274430787896143
As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market.	3.6129717844387157
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	1.6071441822447246
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock.	1.8649580732046893
Commissioner, I would like to come back again to my first question, when I asked about the other Commissioners, for it may have sounded as though I was in jest.	3.1418333756750063
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable.	1.8537516276490245
Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring.	1.6021738418815865
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid.	3.141946440834565
In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent.	2.3011567634048147
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries.	3.274129797379908
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	2.619736235158733
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal.	3.7132665184041733
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	1.8024741219147995
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	2.720910702474579
Talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present Member States and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant States are concerned.	2.538270182624445
We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern.	3.035650620996629
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle.	2.2216480561504883
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test.	2.771980040635228
Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition.	2.3883863850233706
As regards the participation of the European Parliament in the conference proceedings, I think that Mr Seixas da Costa will agree with me, on the basis of our shared experience, in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Brok, are going to be working.	3.10063893478886
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	4.006679639717124
Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome.	2.377104782402215
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.	2.1399720686629244
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	3.219090979813707
Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups.	2.80864050238502
Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union.	2.8665108144818583
Finally, I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use.	3.8908010453850195
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission, which checks their conformity with the general guidelines, adopted.	3.7474324274010744
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière' s report.	2.6876642549238956
European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread.	3.415148967756483
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	2.8274166899030573
If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard.	3.7619509050312425
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk.	1.868380033905226
In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping.	3.792646025868099
Scrapie	21.75018985665072
This is because it is essential to achieve two things: the European model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured, and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products, mainly to the benefit of developing countries.	3.1713294692673855
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	2.1584552804085746
Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission.	3.259877234232121
Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid.	2.675193589401082
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening.	4.13000140715949
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries?	2.459853791421048
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	2.8134128137059644
In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.	2.65231918707004
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	1.8433141401797375
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.	3.1167992455619977
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work.	3.0954119329830534
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics.	2.154088102002002
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	6.746961982709022
As regards the national and/or local level of employee involvement, the Commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented, as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions.	2.4190395676680754
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71.	2.558829111823451
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect.	2.2904359428015084
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	2.600966955923207
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration.	2.254195374377588
	32.62528478497609
That concludes questions to the Council.	2.4430055644493702
- (FR) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria.	3.9843034509178725
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	2.7667855996867496
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	2.013708479142304
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics.	2.346403667112018
Reforming the Commission	510.02007517981343
Let me explain.	2.5780488418346197
We need to pinpoint, and draw up an inventory of, the problem areas for coherence.	2.9037359788564947
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy, including ourselves at this level, could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well.	1.7491389328637832
But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness.	2.129890056023102
Do not count on me to keep quiet, without doing or saying anything.	1.6181545335737868
Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	2.254500603682038
I think that we have just had a great political debate, equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it.	3.725150733483083
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern.	1.5691942406738622
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers.	2.8602027648815618
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution.	2.8885807409383166
The rapporteur' s phrasing was therefore too limiting.	2.7775849352871314
As a farmer and Member of Parliament, I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole.	2.6473504746606795
Again, because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward, we have to thank Vice-President Imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our Community.	2.2179484247047827
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	1.7473107077354046
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects, research, information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy.	2.037670817380857
But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets.	3.3170173805420164
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile.	3.566217001307084
As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form.	2.5773554421080203
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged.	2.921588688652607
But we must support our tourism!	3.89215351737677
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000.	2.349311750305187
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	3.0618931871129114
The disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer, Commissioner, concern, first and foremost, another directive, namely the working time directive, but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further Treaty infringement proceedings looming because the Danish Government does not intend, or has expressly stated that it does not wish, to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements.	2.4723037671538606
But under the influence of the free movement of employees, of the internal market and of the euro, the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated.	3.4224626967553964
Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster.	3.324322309259187
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided.	2.2296441032959318
In the past, workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival. Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant.	2.2304884303465426
Take the new chocolate directive, which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid.	1.8367923118094642
The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	3.5739491656499696
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Böge' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament' s temporary BSE Committee.	3.753071287419356
Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000)	1.9457374697155403
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights.	1.5247419882914255
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced.	2.5616884032779192
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission?	2.8851965296905497
Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	2.4609166725916958
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.	3.3892920200015375
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	3.5313638664496074
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector.	2.0443901077903344
In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics.	2.928295060598421
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date.	2.145699088390722
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs.	2.1176660886508607
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	2.64995526966882
Welcome	21.75018985665072
Madam President, since these matters are currently being considered by the Quaestors, may I ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the Register of Interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and, above all, to ensure that the Register is not only available for inspection by this House, but is also published on the Internet?	3.203103193537827
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs.	2.7080437680692127
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them.	2.606945867831472
In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals.	3.069952167010042
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.	2.1844401043181407
So again, rhetoric and reality.	1.51838247389534
In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons.	3.9678814396244113
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates.	2.205067256656058
The next item is the report (A5-0004/2000) by Mrs van der Laan, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on giving discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities for the 1997 financial year (Section I - Parliament, II - Council, III - Commission, IV - Court of Justice and V - Court of Auditors) [SEC(1998) 520 - C4-0350/1998, SEC(1998) 522 - C4-0351/1998, SEC(1998) 519 - C4-0352/1999]	2.2739302836953863
This is therefore an aspect to be considered.	2.621015186468954
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%.	2.316894770180579
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy?	2.725054182377775
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	3.3915841771736885
If revenue is lost, then public interest operations will be revised and cut, and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made.	2.4830698646967635
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.	2.9046863203593274
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	2.981042036391812
Firstly, for the single market.	8.669881780078166
They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case.	3.6096735393520896
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field.	2.1597156616945252
Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism.	2.439128727828823
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.	3.8170536489846505
Subject: Environmental problems caused by the Drogheda Port Company development project, and the role of the Court of Auditors A major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the Boyne Estuary, Ireland, following a development project of the Drogheda Port Company.	2.6139191847536667
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	1.940511792145927
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve.	2.3272761286393893
Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission.	3.368400761525311
Despite this, there are some amendments which the Commission cannot adopt: Amendment No 26, which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start; parts of Amendment No 27, especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted, the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision-taking of Member States concerning delegation is repealed; Amendment No 31 because the Commission is of the opinion that the application of Article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in UCITS.	2.486988393401655
And the merit of Mr Corrie' s report is that it highlights the value of this original, proactive development instrument, together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly.	2.70486159717189
But even in this crucial area of administration, Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility.	2.537447473466205
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact.	3.143755630818265
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons.	3.2747878431666666
Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature.	1.887731958916138
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women' s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today' s debate.	2.4597665760005776
There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation.	3.0138699998310483
Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers.	2.814085014456405
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible.	2.707810464753386
For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life.	2.0864725781301527
I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals.	3.056338437416715
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union.	2.3352044962963787
Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge.	1.4390536562577112
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission.	3.1279455066590045
I should, however, like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them BSE-infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is indistinguishable from the symptoms of scrapie.	2.2673932872213
But none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence, because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the United States this weekend, we will have to remember that, for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region, 60 are contributed by the European Union.	3.104882420051931
The most remote regions may benefit from support under strand B. The Commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand A is not comprehensive, but is comprehensive for strand B. The Commission reserves the option to, at a later date, put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions, for strand C.	2.228078240966838
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	3.128711033206
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker, as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending.	2.8791788608636355
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	3.0453821256058213
We should retain some form of ex ante financial control.	1.8685078803050865
In Italy, Commissioner Liikanen, Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14% of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as, 'having the most highly-skilled workforce of all its plants' , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital.	2.408836906637988
A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation.	1.8547577128242747
What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice.	2.433256268803934
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States.	3.916899865750253
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	3.8022820968928417
In a service which is theoretically liberalised, free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position, agreements between companies and other similar circumstances.	2.0837318257890143
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	2.8677641066126207
From that standpoint, Aphrodite' s island, as Cyprus is known, and the pirates' island, as we islanders say of Malta with great affection, are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay.	3.177613087021693
Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too.	2.932465588532656
Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies.	3.1597185345194387
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn.	2.8022481299965203
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	2.5694814167374775
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside' s problems, which are characterised by the decline of farming, which was and should remain the countryside' s basic social and economic branch.	2.8299519339050847
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March.	2.0679721375941087
That surely is in everyone' s interests.	1.4770227408454546
This argument is therefore not relevant.	2.362978516058432
Similarly, it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent.	2.3935411117252983
How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians?	1.9778670713296898
The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted.	3.580416162234896
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people.	3.533788390643181
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.	2.967665100576856
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy.	3.3767333240149022
This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité, touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman.	3.30167474928257
I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently.	1.990941498978312
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate.	2.6587442924400366
B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance	2.1167688494809305
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state, government and party delirium as regards the European Union' s funding.	2.8616488056811793
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles, our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries.	3.215067015661842
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan.	2.7120169600783313
The next item is the report A5-0017/2000 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament: Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment (COM(1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)).	2.22256997604875
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes.	2.681056959336715
The second point is the enlargement of the Union.	2.912382631544796
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform.	6.854031260851121
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions.	2.298344259936258
The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice.	2.8568191135014196
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	3.9335374915008727
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ.	2.7439839487465667
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	3.5054400068559834
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	3.717985338379178
In short, the issue is an important one.	4.98718214308618
. I accept that.	4.730916148282074
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed; it was a spontaneous and natural move.	2.1698042874355283
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.	1.951397983513488
I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy.	3.221267084249645
I have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing Community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation.	2.2863328763699284
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	1.8944284289263564
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past.	2.16435263417474
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	2.205580831521032
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	3.14092089693309
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future.	2.5832891255006767
Will the Commission present new initiatives in order to see whether, through the constant efforts of the Commission and Parliament, we can gradually convince the Council to do something on this issue?	4.497249064427897
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you.	3.3937818243856865
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority.	1.7298882107979012
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom.	2.7653846872504713
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.	4.2080252422032345
Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union.	2.4880864083383694
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement.	2.596609027481978
I would like to end on the following point. Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.	2.9819293593379808
In order to achieve this, action is required in four areas.	3.8789434133246066
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	1.9776228583366173
I do not necessarily mean financial resources.	4.841536146006909
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given.	2.141195289093225
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach.	2.4204763635235134
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States.	3.772360519728582
Have you already included your second term of office?	1.9507018470229116
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	2.833691810841686
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers.	3.337890985570254
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	2.998525310251334
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out.	4.240873024530992
Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy.	3.0494825860490864
This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47.	2.7615894983120173
I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala.	2.7821881713186967
For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho.	3.365759842657234
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	5.559364144582105
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free.	2.0840366967182424
In view of this growing interest, the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle.	4.193119848092258
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Britain, to remove the retrospective nature of this measure.	2.106613351581253
We must be aware of this connection; I do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm, but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course!	2.8684056022709434
Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings.	1.8729459192712619
We do not know what is happening.	5.59970599495055
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference.	1.8240575648306718
It turned its threatened loss of power into an "heroic battle for the preservation of values" and an imminent, pure-and-simple "decision between democracy and non-democracy" .	1.958088754449042
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing.	2.840564212107624
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval.	1.5653973445221552
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does.	3.6941651517579355
Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying.	3.8682257081789233
What do we expect from a government in any case?	3.5387989955842225
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state.	2.6488197535036346
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	2.673085029915189
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	3.2455115175684393
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	2.555422467215494
Criminal law is part of each individual nation' s own cultural tradition, and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts.	2.9105442254435085
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	2.037948053042066
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens.	1.9815913857843614
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	2.848420186319155
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	2.1421026989655783
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	3.025698309474961
Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland.	2.348391816704725
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures.	2.5804524706949348
Already stretched resources are being further stretched.	2.1404951720501035
The postal service is also extremely important to companies.	3.054335932156376
Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	3.766036262015154
From that standpoint, the fact that so far it has resisted any influences from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us, any State, any policy or any view, impel that small republic towards external, disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems, granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy.	2.1963503567270304
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco.	2.379096566035306
Thank you for the presentation.	6.384185952422855
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status.	1.4491415225234214
Apparently, they were.	4.157315727874918
For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this.	2.814586390753267
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years.	2.494125186776064
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	1.9140365080375765
As part of our proposals in this area - which I expect to bring forward at the end of this year - I will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the Commission.	3.5295096167952744
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council.	4.092057372859603
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33% or even 35% in one' s own country.	3.0472550004049794
We must, of course, always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help.	3.0861342802614784
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain, let alone eradicate ISA, and while failing to deliver its objectives, the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance.	2.120694726277434
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit.	3.830851857823453
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter.	2.6043773121109446
Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards?	2.0820111233615664
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed.	1.7175586449925484
A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost.	2.1049518204509567
Parliament would, of course, welcome this with open arms. If this were possible, it would be a huge, historic victory.	2.793602323698032
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	2.602964534426435
In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources.	3.0891212436392568
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today.	3.492788790648282
It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth.	2.328401763240167
But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.	3.460200145315887
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	2.4213934360233003
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions.	2.8566677751660157
Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other.	2.107675949047902
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate, as an opportunity that each country should grasp, then this is the right approach.	3.3593361822404244
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25%, as opposed to less than 5% in other countries?	2.6082678808386244
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence.	2.7107161807475193
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention.	3.0638640834624913
I want to emphasise four points.	4.582499272742218
I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people.	3.6669228848514925
In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services.	2.93743616225179
We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year.	3.8482702646007705
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape.	2.425499571665964
On the other hand, it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament, which were minimal anyway.	3.6778579132977427
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP.	3.6221367302904746
These programmes have, therefore, been important channels for participative democracy, the rationale of the citizen for Europe.	2.5973909800645494
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies, which is linked to a drop in employment.	3.632709583794802
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out, bit by bit, because the elderly live too long, leading to problems with pension payments.	1.7392386928703643
In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days.	3.811709067697227
If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes.	3.1935175849983053
The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law.	2.5952277609221626
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	2.1538106030405166
As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level.	2.8803471361980817
Report (A5-0012/2000) by Mr Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council directive extending the freedom to provide cross-border services to third-country nationals established within the Community (COM(99)0003 - C5-0050/2000 - 1999/0013(CNS))	1.9659291341038576
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop.	1.9501770802297524
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping.	3.04862457478395
I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: "Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such" .	2.748060604675723
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted.	2.423096723498633
Madam President, my Group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today, particularly as we have spared no effort along with Members of other groups to bring this about.	3.158796296042268
We must put a stop to this trend.	2.3699073545998313
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	3.2520463601004734
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	2.3949486567903717
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	2.5437523435023017
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about.	3.829159772634044
Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.	2.112018432368295
Mr President, the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference.	3.1059644781355313
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile.	3.365642933694728
Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive.	3.861593210800478
So tomorrow, if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs, this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable.	2.9277484849407305
However, we must be realistic.	7.13979336582578
It would appear that we are in agreement about this.	3.5899365088423636
A report on the work to be undertaken, together with the Member States and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now.	3.2747658797495034
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path, which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union, we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine.	3.3814398047966274
The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council.	2.98753142638878
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity, but also from domestic activity.	2.425607786337231
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.	2.3261677975539037
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	3.52630187346313
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter.	2.4141058874408983
Apart from Amendment No 76, which was an error, since I intended to vote in favour, the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation:	2.660986092718454
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	4.353502116442405
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	2.7120735965937794
As I informed Mr Davies, I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors.	1.9402699766082874
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed, too extensive and too late.	2.8708696078164637
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service.	2.1367720319182006
If not, why not?	2.6092977399783934
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	4.637570700389223
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	3.83635594741423
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	2.4739584107827843
Free enterprise, free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union.	2.800447440781506
Directive 70/524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives.	2.1044212515825693
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	1.7943963182582898
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	1.8452853875105695
According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome.	3.5748559801454527
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September.	3.832935665861917
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock.	3.603213291603677
There should be no attempt to have one or other organisation, which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known, pushed a little on to the sidelines, say because of official local or regional policy.	2.543159944818165
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.	3.3816648405778205
I am talking about Milosevic.	2.5830326126035508
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level.	2.819800149200102
I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles.	1.9747243395140228
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra.	2.2096172986336433
I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe one minute' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	2.171150155626417
But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development.	2.895639989440979
There is one final issue I would like to raise.	4.126939593725244
Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation.	2.841646433423935
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence.	1.9359364986645913
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.	4.401096587583588
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect.	4.2998288984705795
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights, including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society.	2.352594345158673
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today' s debate.	2.5249887628914425
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment.	3.4086692454408474
Is this speculative?	1.3184317355815225
After years of 'good and loyal service' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries.	2.6441596907478075
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years.	3.220438807604418
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen.	2.129927216319738
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing.	2.975413135616448
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy, the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows.	3.495232416600128
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home, and is resolving them with increasing success.	3.300612676302963
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	3.1319371214438205
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	1.8171704113313678
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field.	2.0131284871579784
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform	1.2735582015136497
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related.	2.9142507187981503
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL.	1.8400871365068634
As honourable Members will see from the document, which will be available to them today, the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission, with this Parliament and with the Council, which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January, have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements.	3.536131403666102
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done.	3.1456925052475633
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law.	4.604304070214225
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting.	3.1999164630556756
Parliament' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy.	3.5128482060198367
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	2.5625437932673605
Over the past couple of years, a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and, more especially, the Lomé countries.	2.981102398275549
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report, which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated.	3.6935710488821774
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations.	2.1164038690323115
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	2.5319401313734398
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	2.954199665145709
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.	3.1328527620005207
Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition.	3.491814787852968
Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men.	2.492425870047768
I hope that honourable Members will realise that, regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind, the day-to-day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when I say governments I mean all governments.	2.5330011900354727
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	3.0203200701100172
You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party' s summit meeting.	2.659661928684581
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner.	2.626565971567665
However, the Liberal Group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and, therefore, we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements.	3.1737640435127386
While others may have the biggest rockets, the EU has the deepest pockets.	3.1907712201717713
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	1.778910951802909
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	1.782527023606158
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify.	2.635571282923351
In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television.	2.3085483544660694
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce.	2.2294304528490922
It is, however, regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis.	2.829824817459644
The El Ejido incidents were shocking, as several Members have said in their speeches.	2.0769188395010802
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group.	3.1306394923994505
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	3.099831960231078
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.	3.354080684557952
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done.	3.3513011433025253
As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day.	2.959869283601852
For the substance TBT, this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance.	3.423291825815686
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	3.223590877489571
The Committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of endogenous development, in particular based on local traditions, techniques and practices, on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy.	2.1821863097313803
In addition, you should know that, on 4 June 1998, the Council approved the recommendation for a pan-European type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs, the aim of which is to help them travel in all Member States with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout Europe.	3.226411098797754
A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.	2.3111729408710695
Otherwise, in my view, we are beavering away at the symptoms, but not the causes.	3.9013244420098836
I refer to point 9.	3.050434858427376
Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality.	2.1437644576697585
.	77.3301660757284
It is a report which tries to give direction.	3.9283878773799636
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended.	2.4883409585040743
We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.	3.440038015371206
On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.	3.977862141474922
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person.	2.8189154899884645
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.	2.3355151548072355
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.	2.894867320699451
I am stressing this point because, when disasters are being reported daily in the news, we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done. Then, in our haste, we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time.	2.2113101130628245
Directive 70/524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to Parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and Parliament obviously did not accord genetically-modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when I was rapporteur.	2.5405582632606234
Above all, Madam President - and here I will end - we must be able to express this in plain language, clearly, by changing to some extent the jargon which we use, because we cannot ask the Europeans, who are living through profound changes, to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible.	2.7659309627512934
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that.	2.7501771726690336
Let us, in particular, focus attention on the re-admission clauses, which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked.	2.970737501967157
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation.	2.421767689047937
The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market.	3.160690233166538
As your rapporteur has requested, I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand.	3.0635690822179757
Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning.	3.093543285733473
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	3.0472174241316203
.	77.3301660757284
I want to emphasise that a number of the other amendments affecting the proposal' s basic components involve a considerable watering-down of the level of environmental protection aimed at by the common position.	2.7872455421454276
It concerns the issue of recycling costs.	5.337004057707093
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument.	1.668906786683052
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time.	2.8228195790675628
My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations.	3.3343067119860206
It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time.	2.445117120397073
Because the issue is to be decided upon in March in the Council, Parliament has cause to adopt a position on the proposal now, so that the Member States have time also to take due account of Parliament' s points of view in the decision which has to be made in March.	4.042548100273543
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive.	7.452992323761106
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45.	2.349508793572034
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	2.004234757398991
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals.	2.0343766935191288
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today.	3.457173428312198
Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union.	2.452274586014291
With regard to the Judicial Network, significant progress has been made, in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the European Judicial Network, whilst the Multi-disciplinary Group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan.	3.675718475566832
Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces.	2.3710570112626024
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes.	1.9525065762512883
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi.	3.213274577315467
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement.	3.9121258163760824
You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals.	3.1492149079414555
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases, thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50% Commission, 50% Member State.	2.184773238410113
Nevertheless, Mr Alavanos, the Council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in Kosovo does not match the desired amount, in terms of what the various Member States have been able to raise, and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground.	3.080474537831096
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure.	4.4183697645582924
That is most certainly relevant.	1.675993731321262
Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades.	2.842643118576092
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules.	2.916058219624875
We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace.	2.08122108829555
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	2.8145801968425945
We must give them this opportunity.	2.290563965063353
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently.	1.7356879694119454
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.	2.8894308444702013
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council.	2.324345705711247
Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected.	2.5529437479116845
If they are proven not to be, we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority.	3.5517234613190687
That cannot excuse everything that we came across.	1.6870536902071513
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health.	2.904255047909123
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring.	2.1071785025962897
And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives.	3.3810773702875356
(Parliament approved the request)	3.339514892216148
Report (A5-0073/1999) by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code) (COM(1999)94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS))	2.1036685922515326
However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	2.5607774099469545
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year.	2.1986167899964904
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	2.170590356626552
I want us to be in a position in which we can say: 'It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .	2.6144997805926344
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	3.1065700405778056
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions.	2.6195559378172986
As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation.	4.289367459374302
This is why this report is also so politically charged: a report, by the way, on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly.	4.216840897486231
Of course, there is a need for solidarity here.	5.481301344821758
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.	1.7344115403540121
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	4.675043402068702
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	2.531277521076661
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach, the European Union is taking exactly the right line, not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted.	3.2346055909944655
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork.	2.4658877571833986
There is no contradiction between the two.	4.982589698487224
So, first of all, we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level. This will, of course, provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of.	2.801343799941049
We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there.	3.23519874957378
Question No 40 by (H-0808/99):	1.2605856117352525
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely.	2.6048990148197078
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	3.3725057637008384
Madam President, I should like to leave it here. As far as the resolution is concerned, of which I have seen a draft, the Commission will await the vote and will, based on this, determine its stance.	3.9411852700230483
However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead!	2.607730720523972
Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the European Union is implementing in countries in that area, will create new problems there, new tribulations for their peoples, and will reinforce the dominant role of the American and European imperialists, we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of FYROM.	3.275808433889058
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	2.0399847895073417
The discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments. The first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the European Union and the north of the island, without this necessarily signifying recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level, but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island, if a solution can, in the meantime, be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island.	2.86204756143765
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	2.6899825904404553
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	2.1172976962077943
However, it is not under threat from Europe.	4.409494064186829
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	3.422487501274305
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	2.5175530913735322
Madam President, Representative of the Council, Commissioner, a week ago, the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm.	3.8310219706808
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	2.417908705019351
Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light.	2.844770847239702
Stand firm on the demand for mobility, not as a right, as it says here in the report, but as a management tool.	3.294463894136902
Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe.	4.8383822737753235
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment.	2.4619261728008577
In addition to national programmes, the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy, transport and environmental sectors.	3.626472630111551
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe.	3.2163777311112383
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator.	2.0362695458767024
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out.	2.16311801962263
We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans.	2.9623283869056753
In this respect, the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed.	3.86764281562405
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	2.263821688689911
Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	2.753065549388923
As forcefully underlined by this report, labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock.	2.233737816402544
We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do.	2.324837674272286
On this we are clear.	2.4419284518308255
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency.	4.05236509106539
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring.	2.921673158374559
Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act.	3.254216919804436
Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent.	3.1284642234164397
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds.	3.0718601579356943
Mr President, the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals, notably, of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group, which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and, in my opinion, this version is an improvement on the original.	4.02571171680649
We need more dialogue, not just with each other but also with civil society.	3.254699341589746
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war.	1.5824100073133844
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation.	2.036106163475802
Question No 28 by (H-0781/99):	1.2605856117352525
However, agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues, and the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, has suggested three new topics: sovereignty, confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island.	3.174371739107907
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax, to the EU. This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries.	3.147820224167821
Do we have a special problem in this regard?	7.202347342113414
I totally agree with Mr von Boetticher and Mr Schulz' s remarks, and truly believe that the European Parliament and the Court of Justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom, security and justice, without having to derogate from their own powers.	3.7934921095759098
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries.	1.7551189116838977
In my mind, illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping.	2.0871162892257464
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN, in which, however, we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names.	3.2095500179094545
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	2.7026688191351327
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	2.512690910786706
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments.	3.448013918033428
I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run.	2.9397633947825588
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	2.891018373594841
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen.	3.2466411438660034
Finally, I should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy.	3.0633336055265414
That message must be taken back from here today.	2.4846869484853964
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	3.1150333090161464
We estimate that the Commission' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer.	3.0276205765413486
So we are working within this framework and not outside it.	2.7507191962732827
But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany.	2.080724208583995
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome.	3.4377791738763417
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	2.67504636043399
Clearly, the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, southern regions for example, is very different, and should be studied carefully.	2.7142324452254725
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	1.6896424728785553
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing.	3.31877497346038
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	3.0921887646849293
This debate, I think, has summed it up.	4.46657133820337
(FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a "constitutional process to be launched" .	3.59726562785613
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	2.171459051758906
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present.	2.733284485625008
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam, namely subsidiarity.	2.679277623283603
In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid.	2.2414024376002466
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	2.3328914633231763
In this respect, what the Commission says about boosting Europe' s voice is important.	2.9020007843041853
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply.	2.271853719345738
He should never have arrived in Spain, where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities.	2.289937478548809
(Parliament adopted the oral amendment)	2.147015187417177
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	3.207270275537403
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	2.442822121642824
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed.	3.247497018474642
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	2.7206087117766176
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	2.167140940062099
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam.	3.0216332666692782
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats.	2.6254680055012725
What we should do now, I feel, is wait, particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service, which many of our fellow citizens still value highly.	2.718787181949936
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	2.667180920076744
Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement.	4.4747621138082545
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.	1.8339268173281627
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your comments very carefully, and in particular to the rather emotional comments about Cyprus, especially in defence of the present legal situation in Cyprus, which the European Union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.	3.002944982446625
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence.	2.8517610613240887
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time.	3.096317597565177
I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated.	3.29978090264262
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	2.991485822593814
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts.	2.946539012807759
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union, and to deal with the notorious problem, which will no doubt arise again, of the aim of a Community register.	3.8306852975790573
In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions.	3.128181986898753
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous.	3.2091441686698254
Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	3.9238869124806954
We are right to blacklist Haider' s Austria; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination.	1.9794499707438038
Various arguments have been presented in its favour.	2.4832915028504425
Secondly, the new "in" word is flexibility.	4.605349113056216
Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries.	2.6545384866154933
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted.	1.9661129922372638
If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched.	2.3058162106371074
You did not call me either.	2.219236744979899
Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	3.488351917195304
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi.	2.9514160532526983
That, too, is a step forward.	5.914699440063022
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights.	2.3912215543853437
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my view, the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty.	3.943756136400868
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it.	4.184054502752906
Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the draft communication from the Commission to the Member States establishing the guidelines for Community Initiative Programmes (CIPs) for which the Member States are invited to submit proposals for support under the EQUAL initiative (COM(1999) 476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186(COS))	2.6778419294664424
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	2.487546863691439
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	2.3738126748412363
This issue is extremely topical.	3.8256970299408772
This means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy, but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance, trade and investment. Furthermore, this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries' own policies.	2.743593071784181
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient.	3.218622012252749
Turning to judicial cooperation, in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, I sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the Council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings.	2.7612215427668287
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	3.3204521910868916
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port.	3.942200997106576
Neither outcome would be satisfactory.	1.4833666837945971
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery.	3.101941365741211
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other.	2.9933091524523223
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	3.2346317310330597
First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes.	2.6689188297924304
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today.	2.365468595470212
Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year.	3.6211412955714977
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter.	3.7035790497469776
However, we must remember that, in addition to URBAN, a number of other Community instruments are also available in the social sector: innovative actions under Article 6 of the ESF regulation, pilot projects, particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the European Parliament under the 2000 budget and the EQUAL and INTERREG initiatives and mainstream ESF activities.	2.8875857023895914
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.	3.4893483818215856
First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck.	3.4673214660959304
Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech.	5.660276211761692
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work.	3.869188342907385
We are to know when they meet.	3.2465749800955495
The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	2.245509956822502
Rather than banning flags of convenience, which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet, under the 1995 EU directive on port state control, national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations.	2.3765386737379064
Mr Marset Campos, you will be aware, first of all, of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation, particularly an air-based one, and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that, whilst they are not military targets as such, are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine.	2.728657581805563
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do.	2.3215159177027647
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but, nevertheless, that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections; more than the countries with flags of convenience.	2.195268605643728
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	3.0908634678089992
For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal.	2.6256094380846204
I emphatically support the rapporteur' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive, from the list of measures to the question of employment measures.	3.764275098684548
In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	3.0248025525735542
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia.	2.4283142602796652
Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People' s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.	2.807236204892194
We all have a duty to put our own house in order.	2.3729753538228966
Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future.	2.345371187893424
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power.	2.367182727570847
I think they should have.	4.741186420638953
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000.	2.353902308486019
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that, although the data are to be scientifically based, they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes.	3.3414333319178375
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER+ programmes run smoothly.	3.0101556246118695
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this.	2.032466134328663
Helicopters are therefore needed.	1.733784324081151
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols, and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe, in particular on cyber crime.	3.538462703649593
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF.	2.948626608584205
No. Clearly, we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment, but it will be very much greater.	4.44284709691083
Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves.	2.0931873308141262
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission.	3.7116002819838374
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions.	1.8778431575325067
My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	3.0945787201998263
(FR) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again.	2.151502293409751
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline, I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000, as set in the common position - must now be moved forward.	2.8843423368339707
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto.	2.6926475294411105
In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining.	3.6699091477833994
My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons.	2.8402632874474625
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse.	3.8979401181124143
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union.	2.553441744810185
Let me, in this connection, welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of Mrs Javette-Le Besque, spokesperson for the oil slick action group "Marée noire" , made up of men and women from the French department of Morbihan.	3.155782848929998
If you look carefully, this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets.	1.835928582958018
Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	2.474571140685563
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	2.881161613285111
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.	2.381427777356077
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences.	1.838119451739622
In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos.	3.445606422696972
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it.	1.8084914406899886
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth.	2.146482272177047
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.	3.244787279433835
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see.	3.7070098642887777
When will we debate that?	2.1786037264081157
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs.	2.768198164969959
This is reasonable and we support this, but we have to ask the Commissioner, why not Africa?	4.03506091618697
Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	2.3257673321022905
Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor.	3.8782386588170206
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	4.078395177810614
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld' s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.	2.875294652785148
This is the context that the rapporteur finds himself working in, making a legal link between the issue of GMOs and feedingstuffs, and noting that the latter "shall be authorised only if ... safe for human health and the environment" .	2.661548332346308
Fourthly, technically speaking, this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control.	2.2492730036460626
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country.	3.740123922601134
I therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference.	2.0931388922561984
We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point.	3.101217163232031
Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition.	3.52866880047994
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million.	2.5078169120251737
In a word, I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe, fellow Members, when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves.	2.5604895046190608
I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union.	2.5168053229159417
It is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case, just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas, such as forest reproductive material, to mention just one example.	2.864099130457671
This proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals, for the provision of cross-border services.	2.893756955444262
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.	2.8521321518148772
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	2.39639543890138
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	3.1094801817911226
I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that.	2.926368473444873
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points.	4.262090977925507
To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted.	2.596844386991802
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	2.930590293961787
For the moment, it appears that, in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59% increase in the price of postal services.	3.376109159841386
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned.	2.6307399019407924
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information.	2.561964581201181
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.847771585005342
However, the Council statement gave me hope for the future.	3.7581440782665663
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	2.6037494483568064
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable.	2.8472161387293156
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals.	2.5515805236275395
I also stressed the need for prevention.	3.4085254907664764
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards.	2.975706303259912
Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus.	1.7716685036747675
Fourthly, we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country.	2.6166619856831344
Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU.	2.310588690814233
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, to my mind, it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the Council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is completely unacceptable politically and I would add that I consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful.	3.5075548757052966
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile.	2.8414881240104393
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we, on behalf of the Dutch contingency, would like a Dutch television channel.	3.0863256648031347
Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' .	2.4955765327699733
Commissioner, it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe, men and women, are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations.	3.775454118067558
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this.	3.3075430990567214
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.	4.164667207076048
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	3.263381691980371
Thirdly, we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive.	4.59072861739416
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience.	2.2408284396387224
Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems.	2.106495799595287
Marketing, reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of profoundest change and improvement.	2.5059098754907283
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting.	3.122993118689059
We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring.	2.4209469915548323
Mr President, for years, Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests.	3.224026690087608
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%.	1.9627873634987965
Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice-President Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Committee on Culture, for the firm and intelligent position which, each within his own role, they have maintained during the entire conciliation process.	2.5896187182566393
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.	2.123791492641409
Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service.	2.8810630162886706
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account.	4.313689302841456
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this, as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia, plus Albania.	2.4203543237256224
First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95.	2.4954235312701902
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality.	2.059019087180997
Madam President, although some of the aims of the Tobin tax are fairly worthy of support, introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the European Union, as the first area of the world to do so, would sound the death knell for the European currency markets.	3.8401681650346355
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	3.492034842554232
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	2.8304441297180847
A flourishing tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick.	2.0680568036019613
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament.	2.1635482676490216
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.	2.444607153259432
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996.	2.5372187801628003
Mr President, I would like to stress that, in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future.	2.820472271127089
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	3.031831611368706
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	2.1279476860496964
Listen to the resounding voice of Solzhenitsyn in his letter to the Americans, in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of Western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism, an individualism which, far from allowing people to flourish, paves the way for future dictatorship, in fact the worst kind of dictatorship, because those whom it enslaves are not even aware of their terrible servitude.	2.4328178626577817
You have fulfilled your objective for today, which is to answer all the questions.	2.741883914378615
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can.	2.8754866856741006
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised.	2.6339495310946766
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission's practical commitment to that.	2.6054446670428835
Here too, Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention.	2.260116031859372
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999.	3.9198512377569172
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical, realistic and also achievable.	2.630082528588158
The story went that an official in the Commission had apparently told an Austrian businessman that, because he was Austrian, he would possibly be excluded from being able to participate in a scientific development project together with businesses in other countries, including Denmark.	2.444575479085906
In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion.	3.3568122825462807
. Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday.	3.8718675351661056
On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet.	2.7063309611873074
Today, following the 1997 compromise, Member States can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff, with a weight of less than 350 grammes.	2.446482177755185
If you will pardon me for saying so, Mr Kinnock, what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes.	2.6594989611191022
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative.	2.4364310960402027
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital.	3.850220638519434
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic.	2.140666316074464
And, on this subject, Commissioner, you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats.	4.259670472881191
Indeed that was the idea behind it.	2.473993894610146
Mr President, the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo, not just for pregnant women but across the board.	3.4682060223213824
For example, we are currently looking into TAOs. This is a key point but, at the same time, we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission.	3.857914710700925
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	1.6196955345598743
Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy.	4.260028612385496
In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements.	3.7509406195246933
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States.	1.6180596509672893
But, on the other hand, the wider view must also be taken, namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may, in the long term, lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account, and this will be of benefit to everyone.	3.518594313938393
Accordingly, we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG.	3.3643003564962752
I agree with your analysis.	5.052159513748457
The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select.	2.4244624330243645
(The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.)	1.739583404875591
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.	3.0346141455451563
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.	3.3415853233841726
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	1.8057726510273315
Unfortunately not all, but many of them travel the world to see its marvels and to discover and learn more about it: Italians want to see what the English are like, the Greeks want to see what the Turks are like and the French want to see their Italian cousins.	2.522360188269191
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process.	3.1661663112925673
.	77.3301660757284
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures.	1.9864567664990154
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version.	3.493215545230588
I accept this; I take note of it as you do.	2.5580100305721256
Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades.	3.274089298399431
In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration.	2.6026811413210327
We must put an end to this.	2.626111110467176
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform.	2.613320201653275
One is knowing how the committees operate, about their composition, agendas, descriptions, and so on, and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions.	2.563125866788129
Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service.	2.7308456238740972
We have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs. This system should take good account of social, environmental and economic effects, and its implementation should be modulated in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions.	2.1673286485690038
I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.	2.748346899754955
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs.	2.5995872302142087
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States.	1.9517885081983581
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	3.8070446115631777
The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations.	3.4308250877157427
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe.	3.4440437344470127
The less precise, Mr van Hulten, we are in our resolutions, the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like.	3.474021776032112
.	77.3301660757284
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective.	2.3833205754939524
This aid for gathering timber is, of course, only the first stage of an aid package, which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas.	2.9483722655210634
After all, there is no longer mention of a European Public Prosecutor, rather, for legal reasons it has now become an independent, European authority, or "body" to quote Mrs Theato.	2.847862014319445
Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy.	4.151979348931035
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production.	3.692592067613124
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating.	2.289449746316734
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva.	3.698582357798449
They will need time to get used to that too.	1.9716819707279332
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation.	3.0145074847946067
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report.	2.2059877077289025
I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair.	3.0578367319270034
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model.	2.575262316374082
The present directive has three aims. First of all, we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars.	2.5669194446900243
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission.	3.142695133663491
I beg to move acceptance of this report.	2.229105754609789
If I may make a suggestion, Commissioner Barnier, would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject, in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the European Parliament?	3.1218318672283885
On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level.	2.386760602259281
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral.	1.7882384440029624
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000, the date promised by Ehud Barak?	1.9317757518261938
This is a good thing, moreover, and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for.	3.3075556471543344
However, the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people' s self-determination.	3.5458785830034407
The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas?	2.181354640696054
I repeat, a "serious and persistent breach" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State.	3.5807927914446593
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	4.5349156806558355
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	2.9825708653636163
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others.	2.3243128366524095
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results.	2.9319082395892067
Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union.	3.032440965614852
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace.	3.0276982116814173
We finally got here, on Monday at 8.30 p.m., after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling.	2.206967734331562
This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place.	3.544806395644599
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry.	3.9167521717033407
Once again, Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants.	2.8865261593170306
. (DA) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999.	3.471644357831442
The Commission will also support the presidency' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering, an eminently cross-pillar issue.	2.606992362548198
This motion asks the Commission to present a report to Parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax. It also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens.	2.191916422353552
. (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union.	3.1800428831131287
It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition.	2.7906254294121156
Food safety	72.17482167067989
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia.	2.0570003951919706
Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure.	3.207898105207766
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	2.6047417642951407
.	77.3301660757284
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	3.2063541732254572
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country.	2.4585765503733064
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right.	2.7032440208891
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open, democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve.	2.194775832164833
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	1.8807836485564167
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term.	2.1764071855733844
Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement.	2.871078011810589
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses.	3.048717545513277
Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	2.5522981087913115
This is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the Mediterranean countries.	3.4879400681637387
Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions.	2.974065305347051
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force.	2.6157374755910965
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate, which all in all I have found to be encouraging and supportive, and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this House for the policy of the Member States and that of the Commission.	3.9161753154445686
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system.	2.872639275775929
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	2.2663271455386953
Mr President, I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise.	3.460364851550445
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned, and legislation and in relation to treaties, which entail changes being made to legislation.	2.9118271201930295
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis.	2.735823490402038
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate.	2.3003081098121885
Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy.	4.749316884268615
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission' s proposal on scrapie.	3.8738843944084205
The Commission is committed to a universal postal service, as the European Parliament has shown on several occasions, the postal service is actually, as some speakers have already mentioned, a key factor in social and territorial cohesion.	3.5413371802475218
Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting.	2.6944117820511697
In consequence, I seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand A and strand B. These adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects, particularly those of an infrastructural kind.	2.250000840852381
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	2.4773157399398644
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget.	2.266666307262383
Which is why the new 20-year agreement due to be signed in Fiji on 31 May represents more than the simple renewal of the Conventions regulating relations between Europe and the ACP.	3.0542615109129345
And secondly: are we reducing the European car industry' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal?	2.71918915689924
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission, when it talks in terms of decentralisation.	4.580710005753754
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund.	2.446596129258664
We also note that, as before, there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments.	2.5727795076670823
The internal market is the basis for our work.	6.176699565994941
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war.	2.9698341634806673
This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances.	2.966345496053952
As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints.	2.6850743074866052
Madam President, this is an historic moment, as it is now, at last, quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values.	4.403627320411444
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves.	2.777831211245328
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	3.862542394331372
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded.	2.4907046820639884
For us, the Group of the European People' s Party and the European Democrats, it is not only the reform of the institutions of the European Union which will be important in the next five years; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single European currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the European currency in coming years.	3.577563890649361
Consequently, if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future, in light of the economic and employment changes taking place, as well as the requirements of society, modernisation is absolutely essential.	3.3413862135066528
Given the already advanced state of these two countries, compared to other applicants, this should easily allow them to be 'technically and administratively' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme.	2.994929880064637
Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.	4.462551461278147
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you.	2.381258891445472
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.	1.839194174399865
The reason is as follows: this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the European Union.	2.1895142724733336
Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000)	1.0820706359717611
For the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of Europe, and I believe we need, in the long-term, to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future.	3.9271319283281687
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this, I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government.	4.191551888210852
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution.	3.681339228273931
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.	1.7958524823368665
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	2.6389194331600128
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	2.8338621250385767
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3.	2.668158420243423
But there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and I am sure that, as a lawyer and politician you will understand this. Important issues cannot be regulated in annexes.	2.789412371247932
That is something we would do well to recognise.	2.8640407185939076
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation.	2.9254652388788585
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty.	2.3385864097710627
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed.	1.926963226109959
As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them.	3.1458278672824216
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	2.922878039381568
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned.	2.225108861029263
Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.	2.7187624458819033
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December.	2.159580211028431
My message to you is: do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content.	2.6954868055179686
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland.	2.7223063759044757
When social security has repeatedly, and in the words of many influential people, been characterised as a 'cost' and an 'obstacle' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always, of course, on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability, with its dismal monetary-economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests, were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care.	2.3855072506243524
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	3.481572551602168
So I believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring, on the one hand, that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that, on the other hand, there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses.	3.5595611767341584
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	3.6756431786597066
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe' s citizens.	3.1213632054286466
If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians.	2.1837749425591597
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before.	2.6204889240116795
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.	2.581949994951023
What guarantees are there of its reliability?	1.5341753310224475
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position.	4.027643059428969
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously.	2.497515463682743
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	2.593078381810071
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.	3.863628948968303
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11, except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months, as I explained just now.	2.25104086494099
We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	2.8172406358256556
In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary.	2.485970454455476
Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	2.7840309012380757
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists.	2.927798891552152
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.	3.8472012253903767
I was myself a car worker before I was elected.	1.6100523437078973
Will it do the same to us?	2.29127165152559
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow.	2.4152754109198487
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	3.357900815550714
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that, in many cases, we will say this together.	2.6448094782082188
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime.	3.3966320695038825
In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment.	2.8908609796198843
I also welcome the White Paper.	3.79120225653816
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	3.0164433976913423
This is not our opinion.	8.584143484763235
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone.	2.304587961021574
Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States.	3.9103361318775027
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project, which will displace 20 000 Kurds, potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage.	2.349510529182688
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency.	2.6917266214036606
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food.	1.8355437687142888
It is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and I think it is very important for this to be reflected in the Commission' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise motions.	4.291797595578127
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	2.7357946776229904
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates.	2.374622405206746
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again.	2.036126130464453
Mr President, this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999, but which only reached this House at the end of last year.	2.837695600029409
My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia.	2.71184682311488
The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough.	2.344686085591141
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets, bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away.	2.2351737868667922
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared.....	2.6272215216765384
But I would rather like to say something else to you.	3.773492706985859
This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer.	2.522527427750081
Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people' s lives, specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes, particularly of the minimum pensions, and through fighting social exclusion.	2.4401349106339323
This is no longer tolerable.	3.040826534221351
Such a concern is misplaced.	1.8308588442030809
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament.	2.129921785198953
As a supplementary question, I should like to ask you whether, as the Portuguese Presidency, you have made provision for the rights of children, as such, to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter.	3.8056366483246444
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	3.6646023146995943
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	2.752934921277904
Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance.	3.125526146913227
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it.	1.8731824436698088
I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved.	4.376505287473506
Thirdly: it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails.	3.7475172535692995
This concern, ladies and gentlemen, lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative, and I am willing to rewrite the text, if necessary, in order to make this message clearer yet.	3.816908671183275
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling?	2.0885203510335164
Women in the decision-making process	3.301976280544352
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available.	3.7018598621432406
Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme.	2.4434178119858636
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people.	2.6131364964407693
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation.	3.4226629983334558
My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too.	3.3476364760018393
The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions.	3.0227019399798563
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	2.5566983452502567
I nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which, on some occasions, I have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive.	2.5798373234146257
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	2.6750389894214472
On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves.	3.2312827376193445
To date, the Member States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the criteria laid down in ESA 79.	3.2257735979921898
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets.	1.8276240058859992
I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda.	2.8121713857609567
What kind of horse-trading system is this?	3.321529445240896
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party.	2.7923206676881147
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union.	2.7572839268486824
Mr President, I do not want to be misunderstood - I sincerely hope this does not happen - and I should therefore like to start by saying that I am, of course, in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate, necessary reforms.	3.901232387633678
Mr President, I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level.	3.6636866394042724
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him.	3.497174962453611
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right.	5.930053466367785
The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity.	3.34288468256046
No.	77.3301660757284
Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice.	2.9700073190389427
The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text.	3.355178487766316
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework.	2.9904935722898105
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes.	3.0735995919891517
Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union.	2.5995316390277003
The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions.	2.651750330472524
Mr President, I am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to Parliament the main lines of the Commission's White Paper on food safety, adopted on Wednesday last, 12 January, in association with my colleague, Mr Liikanen.	3.119995368984511
Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields.	2.8333715326172477
In France, for example, the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion.	2.556678368392988
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.	1.4944512553245357
What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing.	2.6364508298695015
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries.	2.535147918229627
It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty.	4.259133252500076
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular?	4.169430186584448
The Commission' s objective for the next five years is to become a 'global actor' by showing 'genuine leadership on the world stage' .	3.1062733101547253
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.	2.9637728788058055
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes.	3.252538928710027
When our rivers flooded in 1990, we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage.	1.7943478869230793
In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union?	3.1252650007672536
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	2.8897218764793946
The same cannot be said of the first proposal.	2.6447692226038253
Every statutory article should, of course, not just be judged on its regularity, but also on the importance of its contents.	3.5311664584986358
I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these.	2.526606182566553
In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable.	3.377736874146005
One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility.	3.023542675443868
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye.	1.5266990048024827
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria.	1.4374965612667652
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	3.3942654144477435
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	4.106057083499125
But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done.	3.7248854634933135
If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more.	2.9785479697190085
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	3.5587835349071297
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors.	3.4842551914026916
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	2.1830783684079225
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations.	2.572292390019956
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying "the confederate solution would be best" .	1.4045794940864118
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation, as Mr Böge has just done.	2.8362226573996563
We must therefore act.	5.464647246260301
First, while some people question whether tabling a Geneva resolution makes any difference, several of the most distinguished Chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move, not least because of the message it sends to people in China itself.	2.4480099813218823
How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries?	3.3281058676727864
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	2.996197348516658
Mr President, I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report.	3.539720612330648
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution, for two reasons: firstly because this creates selective responsibility.	2.131850800565966
Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on?	2.359174604043005
Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	2.5464521568346923
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	2.1159768474982346
The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents.	2.778733261678729
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread.	3.0745128520933136
To that extent, it might be thought desirable, even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity.	3.809407041644359
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate.	2.3587447683969005
During the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw Parliament actively involved, thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Adelaide Aglietta - it was understood that the European Parliament and Commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision. On the one hand, certain points which the Council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and, on the other, the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely.	3.162741277109589
Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself.	4.96521526883282
Since Amsterdam, three terms have taken centre stage: complementarity, coordination and cohesion.	1.6451765235394231
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors.	1.907707553390277
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly.	2.6582202345821724
ALTENER	21.75018985665072
We have been told how, currently, people's time is being wasted and that the changes, therefore, could be beneficial.	3.294261362495072
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	2.3534054582438313
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit.	2.801866550008765
We have not done this so far, and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing.	3.9209442764541893
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo	3.4973175603612923
All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor.	2.0345321285322995
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law.	2.3431956833048604
Finally, Mr President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would urge you to address this issue in the Bureau so that we here in Parliament at least comply, in our own administration, with the demands we are making on others.	3.7950206127090667
So that is at least a step forward.	3.400810855063225
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment, the debate we had was not the easiest one.	2.803623687778558
This is a task that has lasted three years, and on which we have been consulted, so to speak, as a matter of course, when this issue, as has already been stressed, comprises highly important formal and substantive facets, which called for a range of assessments, consultations, concerted actions and codecisions.	3.0054074607381973
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	3.4490937656058267
Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms.	2.263948042121276
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain.	2.267966226940631
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account.	3.183035822796536
Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power.	2.7199228986495028
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	4.683002245635691
The topic touches the very core of the European Union.	2.0898510237624195
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments?	3.4845736424498557
We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious.	2.2260690678234
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials.	2.0720178783201995
On the other hand, districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer, as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years.	2.671800506790018
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	3.4830333866250647
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas.	2.7217750464139536
What is meant by the Commission' s declared objective of 'economic reform' in the labour market?	3.727507892100262
Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide.	3.192066902447315
Consistency and action are needed.	1.69282786104836
Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino.	4.636669247467587
We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one.	3.476040029948716
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism.	2.32347887072391
While we are on the subject, where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend European interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way, one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict, which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the Commission to fight its corner.	2.3012217965243296
For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies.	3.1901536868779043
Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually.	3.4955723892859525
We can therefore table only one additional item.	1.832807316198436
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	3.5133683476542537
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas.	3.8277751463047607
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react, for their capitulation to the multinationals.	1.7183346397202282
It is equally true, however, that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II.	3.0277452038454986
We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible.	2.950876458088941
With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs.	2.81384292138548
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it.	2.4747755763430543
the report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta [COM(1999)0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)].	2.0862175602352058
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.	2.685817009648001
Question No 6 by (H-0788/99):	1.2605856117352525
As far as I know, that has still not happened.	3.6762235278743796
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and I hope that, with the final decision of the Council, we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in Kosovo by different parties, so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see.	3.067789386245854
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative.	2.131938003528535
I would ask for that to be checked again.	2.7787113584328447
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid.	3.3677103177055714
The only way to eliminate misconceived ideas is to offer alternatives, which brings me back to the subject of our discussion. I firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate, particularly to fight against demagoguery.	2.4789765487106967
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	1.743181326030193
Recourse to the precautionary principle	2.0048378947720953
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group, I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission.	2.764677360324622
With regard to political prisoners in Serbia, Mr MacCormick, it is obvious that, when I say that in Serbia today Mr Milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level, I am referring specifically, not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens. I am also referring to the way Mr Milosevic treats political prisoners, and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition' s rights of access to the media, and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non-governmental organisations, particularly those protecting human rights.	3.342931350148554
In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like.	2.6284296191864276
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order.	2.6122651946022026
Where is the beef?	1.7947221343217445
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs?	3.310044510441515
All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole.	2.807874158486372
VOTE (continuation)	1.0810608778626438
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation.	2.8844251268825554
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace, security and stability.	3.1027558178183274
Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest.	3.592043229370631
Madam President, unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language.	7.010457846634268
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	3.627685467946461
We know that most Austrians respect these values.	2.560375803095331
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid.	4.2646518987750985
Mr President, we take note that the excuse-making, reticent Presidency, which, in recent months, has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today, has come to an end.	3.9378489737216893
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built.	3.022739027383376
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices.	2.1391885014703407
When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned.	4.180318969154286
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead.	2.7269754069044434
In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million.	2.406781812708834
Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails.	3.492761501904309
I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead.	2.819370531788563
At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution.	3.0643946126672255
Of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the pale, completely unacceptable, while at the same time we deal very robustly with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon.	2.6934705481659096
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises, the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way.	2.591612688544246
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	3.737715349237069
Does it reflect this vision of coherence?	1.6249861842592572
This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses.	2.4906154000304284
And yet, and this is the sixth area of incoherence, we do not defend the application of the current Treaties.	4.519873862883232
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.847771585005342
Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there.	3.0927629408619532
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason.	2.152311834599769
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	2.906567364074236
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison.	2.3458367207353645
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop.	4.3278552417321
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States.	2.986537915914075
This means that we need a pressure instrument.	4.687566425833767
So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	2.5829144246795464
This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given.	3.016813562787861
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say - no, definitely not.	3.7067401845207413
As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate.	4.970968889248562
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction.	2.4800653444082337
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.	3.7170397833662436
That concludes the debate.	1.5326323786505276
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months.	3.1326120425514916
Mr President, the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line.	2.3655298486230785
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points, detail and precision are obviously essential.	1.7995273754662366
In the Overseas Countries and Territories Framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some European companies than with generating income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is a matter which we are currently dealing with.	3.0142437423949793
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned.	2.5915332425212374
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States.	1.946484607961171
I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	2.569935261939363
Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.	4.0263443871297655
Amendments Nos 4, 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling.	2.8234421825547846
I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations.	3.476049172678667
Indeed, it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty.	2.687492226494871
Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard.	2.618071137929947
Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today.	3.0161888078243404
In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.	2.3073167377119326
This is not the Union' s only contribution.	6.260826239531383
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	2.720777001549788
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors.	2.310822163337455
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson.	3.5115047285278562
ACP-EU Joint Assembly	1103.2942386054142
This is why it is essential, as a matter of urgency, for the European Union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes.	2.8392402572573343
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm.	1.587520530255717
Thank you for the follow-up question.	5.240175147955524
Who pays for the collection, the dismantling, the disposal and so on?	2.3255751304118006
Again, this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity.	3.979901162131285
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as "Europe's scapegoat" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive.	1.7959826602124573
During the Finnish presidential term, a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process, and, on the basis of this report, I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making.	3.5533357474318947
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play, and not to play, with regard to social security.	3.726782922306884
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity.	4.394322850449575
What sort of impression will an interested public, as well as the rest of the world, have of this five-year programme?	2.909018764175014
Mr Gollnisch, excuse me, you have one minute.	2.7624862460167363
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent.	2.8295491902747583
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals.	3.297614101315177
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s.	2.566083093272565
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State.	2.947837800881052
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam seriously, then our long-term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption.	2.8668563125636664
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	3.761755102876538
Moreover, they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind.	1.9078617877252741
We have asset inflation of global proportions.	1.3961526031170837
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms, namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other, define the limits.	2.932230451570404
My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well.	4.11831503995318
Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these.	1.9564415405671782
In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities.	3.1913825990284113
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently.	3.197630401458909
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world.	4.101523937348438
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed.	4.832434447507621
(The President cut the speaker off)	1.3549877833429338
Lastly, I would like to mention the profoundly human impression I have formed of the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura: his knowledge, his sense of balance, his intellectual qualities, make him, in my opinion, the best possible rapporteur this report could have had.	2.298378067417858
Guidelines of the Directive: a) each city shall provide the means, in terms of energy and technology, sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012; b) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices.	2.449146450796985
They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with.	3.92904637915899
The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise.	2.4358047638534437
That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call.	2.175829996041973
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible.	2.727954130809744
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter.	2.3335906237088695
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions.	2.592173763201058
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	4.416156640143312
Quality has a price, but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future.	1.897358171638881
If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed.	2.6909536892364234
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose.	3.1883829179195353
Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave.	4.052966901446947
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest.	2.676475101492293
At the beginning of December 1999, the first round of negotiations were held in New York, after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island.	2.66164734854899
This also applies, for example, to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced.	4.214406093293602
The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999.	3.0544856297835645
However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed.	3.014479186445847
All these elements have to apply cumulatively.	1.905281027994578
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	1.847771585005342
We need more explanation of what Europe is about.	2.548969448042318
Mr President, in the small amount of time allotted to me, I would like to welcome the Mrs Lienemann' s report and remind the House of three principles, to which all other principles must be subordinate, which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur' s amendments: water is not a commercial product, but the property of all the peoples of the Union; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater, and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity.	3.383839076385254
That being so, I believe the final result will be better.	3.809606944908678
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life.	2.295435101148746
Mr President, a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom.	2.982927309474614
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	3.832954866323589
The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes.	2.689152590730201
We must choose those which are moderate, which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area.	2.6996889362148906
I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary.	3.2937696844165134
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this.	2.3099425077181728
The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform.	5.030040807654958
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today's debate.	3.2517893060849388
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate.	3.6149834615702017
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying, as the Commissioner has already said: around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees, waiting for a helicopter to come and save them.	2.512634416243808
The approach that we have been following in these discussions, and our participation in them, essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist, based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate, and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found.	2.560357794095894
The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	2.779892319802623
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	4.523974259463215
Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure.	2.425748713318848
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do.	2.580865796972438
Consequently, I consider that support for environmental action under the LIFE financial instrument will help to further Community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the Community' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement.	2.5413525987010286
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade.	2.1141873449635313
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production.	3.003505365920539
They will look into the matter thoroughly.	2.414734441536109
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through.	1.7990982787603875
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage.	2.574960730033967
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	2.0101338580690933
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position, whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough.	3.0924929184787406
For years certain countries, including Great Britain, have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens.	2.100521161816443
Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law.	4.254800634905694
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary.	2.863716601175586
We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur.	2.768269462369542
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone, without cutting wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies.	2.255468934348813
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development.	1.9173701017895084
However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints.	3.0462171500487156
Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme.	3.0557346728420662
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.	1.7761218226694466
For example, my brother-in-law, who lives in Rome, started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he wakes until midnight - he has checked the TV screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing.	2.007566118085378
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem.	3.9416025657745073
Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered.	2.4118958831035204
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	3.438798393327869
I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density.	2.407711482302838
How do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide Monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry, having lost the gamble of a take-over, leave with compensation of EUR 30 million?	2.9783280866751713
As regards the subject of flexibility, we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace, and at the thematic level where, for example, cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector.	2.4988584532296136
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report?	3.4521605411765575
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out.	2.279983007115933
That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	3.1150297871661814
For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success.	3.9837585794169525
The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind.	3.262379581125058
If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens.	3.4541838863892096
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	3.2991548996031246
In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary.	3.1313670534300058
History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action.	2.086680567031108
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	1.952276255457318
Madam President, my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the Commission' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate, instead of being reduced to an on-the-spot reaction in plenary.	3.3719000032112088
We say that we want to protect human rights.	4.933989794666612
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	3.129354255302729
A5-0038/2000 by Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy (COM(1999) 541 - C5-0302/1999 - 1999/0218(CNS));	2.206296954785161
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union.	2.777985326725211
Is the Council discussing this issue?	3.6131763505099475
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	2.4395811013569877
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	2.5993233407671497
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	2.581838139228517
The nature of the EU has not changed.	5.931496613473077
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	2.951736475815448
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo.	2.713536328098929
Those representing Europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective, and I am thinking in particular of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, are on the verge of despondency precisely because, since matters are improving, there is less talk of Kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent.	2.864730237009612
There will be no meeting today in Shepherdstown but we must hope, as Mr Patten said just now, that this postponement of the negotiations due to Syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the Middle East.	3.0105726120633256
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos, Tisza, Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy.	1.8744654307330837
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas.	2.5856220830001746
In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up.	3.624175540298548
Before the vote:	7.706026082847671
Böge report (A5-0023/2000)	1.0820706359717611
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation.	2.4536742466195185
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.	2.583544601739776
Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union.	2.6406674419350664
Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other?	3.692184136912659
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	3.2206519531961133
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS.	3.856426680549524
Would sanctions not be appropriate, as the Commissioner stated, for the classification society?	3.7382372970001136
He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders.	2.7409478770575713
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	2.046617637717126
I feel, at any rate, that for the ultimate application of LIFE, at least, there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment.	3.493493582534528
Mr President, we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission, but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion.	4.859355251484399
If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent.	2.154846647821053
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland.	3.7351167288632547
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees.	2.9901406786761235
As we see it, such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot, therefore, be supported.	2.37246278207922
Investment in OTC derivatives, however, should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced.	2.3460449123348797
I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy.	2.6837784024914413
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report.	3.0593417134293364
Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed.	3.6911452218145553
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.2866170460046753
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I should like to start with a quote: "The Commission will continue to work towards establishing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme.	3.057764514024489
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights.	1.9682215660860602
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament.	2.728863236283419
To continue would be economic suicide.	1.5351234241246863
This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages.	3.1212813485886195
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid.	3.1658844291849966
Mr President, "Europe stands for ideals, values and principles.	3.591963283113631
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	2.424559040740648
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights.	1.5534395924491387
Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.	2.7187826282868532
I know that this is somewhat controversial, particularly, because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime.	3.635095031877335
One is subsidiarity.	1.2186496687482917
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem.	1.4717074072376533
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.	1.7682995402641353
Good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees, corruption, human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the European Union and all countries signing the Lomé Convention from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region.	2.4960613588856577
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	3.6885245221843332
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate.	3.0627529160512066
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.	2.430053938579122
However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	4.08409825176036
This applies to them and us.	3.1537830417920545
Water and air surround us everywhere.	1.7506783302344755
I therefore hope, firstly, that our fellow Members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the Council and the Commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other.	3.274938590609001
The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased.	4.402084978448316
The Union' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to more fruitful cooperation.	2.6748947710360493
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because, in the end, we did not manage to adopt a review clause.	2.8384416365163427
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation.	4.058371195596319
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	3.4585222958281627
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role.	2.5270612373360195
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings.	2.886535617026562
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	2.1025304473659996
But what have we seen since then?	1.51722834070062
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers?	2.2033297067259845
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability?	1.5688940150342752
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	3.0210886666728483
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation.	2.5426100760512402
In sport the saying goes, "Do not change a winning team."	1.6498382839199945
At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them.	3.2242767585731675
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.	2.5603427029661443
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	3.618854207572513
The most remote regions, particularly the four French overseas departments, must be able to coordinate INTERREG III and the EDF in order to fund, in turn, cooperation projects with their ACP neighbours in their respective geographical areas.	3.0018711860751544
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	3.3831411630344905
Let us consider the scenario whereby the Commission, not believing itself to be equal to the task, wishes, or proposes to shed, for example, its powers to implement common policies, which it is nevertheless accorded by the Treaty.	2.835624785650048
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism, and not just the economic and financial policy experts.	3.1879202997698615
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	2.5610829778718545
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.	2.196548482236876
Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council.	2.8641985700134844
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency.	2.4794315699199
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities.	2.4853388424629905
Welcome	21.75018985665072
Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be.	2.155073651053744
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth.	3.787470287079073
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union.	3.050160852681914
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	2.2721950481466515
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	4.052739369217371
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma.	2.403093873308465
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died.	2.1215955729511893
The European Union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements, the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats - because, by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of EMU, their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition, they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the Haider type to recruit support for their neo-Nazi ways.	2.297998373493933
I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so.	5.087817031714662
The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107.	1.6037884205903528
What we need here is an integral approach.	3.2288398611837104
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	2.4149807832783456
Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations?	3.6645904140437424
I am surprised it has even been made, because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents.	2.5861724591699713
These are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous Commission.	2.8414835219214303
What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat.	1.7493093222367104
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	2.851277116882609
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders.	3.3074602879055877
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000.	3.2320159473188634
This will dramatically change the way it operates.	2.3186026103332864
Mr President, Commissioner, it is music to my ears to hear you use the word 'citizen' so often.	2.728198629852144
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	2.762500402170302
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used.	3.3322858735751244
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively.	3.764940378711807
In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated.	2.7498471262391817
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars.	3.2413603609921524
It is no accident, Commissioner, that the affected areas are always those European regions which are least developed, those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which, in the majority of cases, do not have any other resources.	3.1147400900133038
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses.	2.5805310124003342
The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures.	2.519996091433348
To this end, I had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the petitioning party and the Member State petitioned.	3.0571898169119094
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together, of innovation, of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other.	2.3340893799475326
The European Parliament can play its role by taking the initiative, even if it does so timidly, on this subject. However, I agree with the previous speaker that, if paragraph 9 were challenged, this motion would clearly lose its substance.	3.172439378566037
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private.	2.208732048525082
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished.	2.8130780369001047
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	1.6278167870722458
It may be true, as was said here, that today we have new possibilities, e.g. electronic possibilities such as e-mail, but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very, very important role and that, in particular, young families, the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail.	2.6795943939246727
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change.	2.854181082850399
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	2.794560304825084
Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	1.8742122301705042
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines, although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds.	3.667557362433297
Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?	3.127410041036019
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one.	2.5176463982470287
These were essentially of three types which I will describe.	2.0846608216792095
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	3.7050512428347506
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4.	3.7571251978802205
Whether total or partial, privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse.	1.5327011753005468
And because of the programme' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER.	2.280359084668247
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	2.403081914496957
The calculations are in decades rather than years.	1.4814355847878975
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia.	2.1140369939966375
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction.	2.290522813043915
I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal.	3.86543706340293
At the same time, it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada, which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India.	2.6021289096270346
Question No 1 by (H-0780/99):	1.2605856117352525
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis.	3.279853712398914
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted.	3.781823218124061
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	2.3831462631807168
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed.	2.044370448320199
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved.	3.428474340004653
Moreover, with regard to the protection of coastal areas, which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish, we hope for tighter controls, which, in our opinion, should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea.	3.29207518417864
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions?	3.240666247083585
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	3.410325302132271
Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us.	5.904461794349043
Human rights, which the EU embraces, are thus under threat, but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated.	3.3630946527367027
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway.	3.0498773660779896
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
As the White Paper makes clear, the new authority must be a value-added structure.	3.6626217781634516
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate.	2.4705725551778683
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region, Lorraine, which have suffered enormous destruction.	2.284217610378525
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo, we have already heard Mr Kouchner, on various occasions, describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure.	2.840732600673631
Mr President, as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years, I have to contradict Mr Dupuis.	3.4451027738201923
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	2.06635026714711
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	2.8712078537277685
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	2.9238961043646343
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.	2.927026450754383
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	3.0378829529588156
Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process?	3.766685843079358
The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition.	2.4747396743880365
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	2.3531849786118615
Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order.	2.406310484563842
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.	2.352246316006414
The postal services in Greece, Great Britain, the Netherlands or Belgium are, of course, all different.	3.0443467821849373
Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions.	1.9881558732173703
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do.	3.172580055720151
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.	4.035475038407312
As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated.	3.6999497071265304
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	4.320692635971685
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do, but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse.	3.7506569849832054
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	3.4630311661642827
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	2.8884044980121764
The perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the Commission communication.	2.7747491650930525
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	2.4959315525109074
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes.	2.6148196215976993
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment.	2.9935489325853033
The European budget is effectively sourced from VAT and on the basis of GDP, especially now that the Community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy, which had already been cut back drastically by the Generalised System of Preferences.	2.268580253522422
We must therefore welcome the fact that the Helsinki European Council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions, and I quote, that "If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition" .	2.766999889574127
Finally, I thank you again for this debate.	4.048960613457735
. (EL) The EU' s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in the form of a joint agreement as established by Article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that Balkan republic.	3.1282024768756886
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established.	2.7315494812381926
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives, it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable.	2.4480376211235364
Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government.	3.835714118838657
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	2.68752043472587
Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	1.6909547839815124
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	2.833126552310987
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this.	2.6514683505861427
In other words, we should not establish conditionality, or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start, but, nevertheless, we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage.	3.77882050649731
Report (A5-0013/2000) by Mr Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM(1999) 444 - C5-0174/1999 - 1999/0196(CNS))	1.7582473320631082
Of course it is as you say.	3.5135849328138455
As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions.	3.0592137274276143
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question!	2.2884956393062272
It is about brominated flame retardants.	2.6543203868396352
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	3.2954943776595895
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future.	2.622839589144717
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	3.0341631559519033
That is what this framework decision is about.	3.783978892139524
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	4.3993568253774225
Today, Parliament is examining, for the last time, this text on 'end-of-life' vehicles and what is to be done with them: their destruction, a commendable intention with regard to our environment.	3.201187094064894
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres?	2.890040254271151
Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	3.814226417895217
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough.	2.7880746103246326
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	4.306445901552662
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success, as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components.	2.112685543187335
Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion.	4.144211648713711
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten.	3.6804439285470516
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources, but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase?	2.526561452321915
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity.	2.6643915655244155
Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti.	3.52400284602744
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union.	3.360365579879828
Thank you, Commissioner for your reply.	3.508154847521111
In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat.	2.392719395949155
Does that not say a lot about management ability?	2.312682271461224
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results.	2.123581113361357
We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage.	3.0118671657560965
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.	3.051356289030435
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.	4.378744630216404
The Community action programme for civil protection, established by a Council decision on 9 December, was launched on 1 January 2000.	2.742546709233019
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.	2.426408775986502
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures.	2.815013524842797
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail.	2.6036037967079557
Within the Commission, the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.	5.702456268049025
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama.	2.2377388224132666
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.	3.0959790792396262
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin.	3.421905706110899
But trying to take something positive from them, I hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance, fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the European Union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it, not at some indefinite moment in the future, but here today.	2.2034963136443038
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	3.192301783530887
I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration.	3.5306280000482717
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned, there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination, especially in the workplace.	3.5730661754854665
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45.	3.661404983323747
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	1.8603920987373272
It is also of great importance to citizens.	5.364063418378785
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda.	3.1368536428902063
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest, which clearly there is not in this case.	2.7165007687664917
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	3.8432343315310873
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings.	1.8988098199838448
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office.	2.309035839059302
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	2.2509670060774454
A coherent legal framework must be re-established.	1.5745919897648324
This is the European Union' s declared aim.	5.76701369079432
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument.	2.9112319525055232
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection!	3.6185802866991565
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights.	3.144568149629346
Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive.	2.4045862318431332
So how far have we come?	1.7525157726722425
First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites.	3.0293376623635977
Three serious issues were discussed: the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women, of which I gave an initial evaluation, the second issue was the report by Mr Busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science, and the third involved Mr Kinnock, who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the Community.	2.815211758494105
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002.	1.5888581930840082
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia.	2.8443517670872476
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament.	2.779863059625753
The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States?	2.4583276025970013
As regards funding, EUR 613 million is not enough. Even EUR 850 million is not enough.	2.197189125228123
I welcome any questions, suggestions or proposals from the Members present.	1.6983477354777232
My fear - even if you shake your head, Mr Prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years, that the Commission should be a simple secretariat for the Council of Ministers.	3.105371932441414
Many of us here in this House have spent years, whether we intended to or not, dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail.	2.932570463015995
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	1.9080612483317896
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term "self-employed" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged.	3.668682097241538
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets.	2.748972190013515
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.	1.7816577145851173
The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered.	2.2130632957792913
This is what we wish to do: maintain our role as a supranational structure, maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties, but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts.	2.6008254399223265
On the issue of Palestine, I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement.	3.862058766023567
That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility.	3.6099716565304654
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement, and this relates to Turkey' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession.	2.920666245235084
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	2.9729362279661693
Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly.	3.827939043218175
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force.	3.192545924037261
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species.	1.7141566300943947
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking.	3.5689801229926736
This is now the opportunity to reiterate to Mr Patten, Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include Europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict.	2.888096187025968
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.	2.9351330151574455
Change in the law is fundamental.	3.4524827090835823
I referred to the case of Italy, not only because the President is very familiar with it, but because Community statistics (Eurostat) themselves reveal that not only has Italy' s welfare expenditure - currently 25.9% - been below the Community average (28.2%) since 1990, but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well, such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).	2.6674824105972177
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree.	1.9052874573637646
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues.	2.5123286532498303
Mr President, these are no arbitrary objectives. These are articles, statutory articles, which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply.	3.779527064325304
The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, have at last found financial peace of mind.	2.201241611988759
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	3.2260679053369357
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance.	2.3270390795389617
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.	2.6143266411062207
I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet.	3.3481525676747426
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in.	2.5504748915040287
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	3.6731750543340373
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region.	3.2509649959457754
The Erika, a vessel flying a Maltese flag, a floating rust bucket, classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers, has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline, a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.	2.106194544996858
I am certain, therefore, that an island such as Malta, with its population of 340 000 cannot accommodate the rigidities of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater.	2.963812772674947
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission's administration with the public.	3.7136990741208527
One such area is tourism which, by its very nature, is very much a national concern.	2.3922836370428557
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter.	4.212167003569748
Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage.	2.414943494911485
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.	3.70094005797815
Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss.	2.4670064525149495
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.	2.442528500747938
They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood.	2.4306527264200746
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	3.4302264535259974
But, ladies and gentlemen, if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a TAO at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials' jobs needed to do this work, because somebody will have to do it and I cannot keep redeploying the same staff indefinitely, at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre-accession structural instrument (ISPA) and in order to ensure that, the Community appropriations for which I am responsible, often in partnership or on terms of coresponsibility with Member States, are monitored better, with discipline and transparency.	2.795791260882207
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text.	2.7953795966191546
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	2.8800421309498843
However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki.	2.369283882529737
However, this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling.	2.303509633448967
I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side!	2.8421612211884555
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.	2.8353933657402592
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	4.392486570509525
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution, to development, to the urbanisation of coastal areas, etc. But we should also think about restoring the environment and, for example, solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia, and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected.	3.6721271839225595
But, in our view, that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced, either as regards the universality or, we hope, the quality of the basic social protection provided.	3.83442628342651
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office.	3.3858433458827895
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved.	2.705552625506354
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.	3.105749523187237
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report.	2.401038877632996
We believe that it is not only necessary to read the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council with some care and attention, but that we should also take advantage of the willingness of the Turkish authorities to help to resolve this situation.	3.2315649581635064
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	5.083477295434164
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate.	3.5540779709812247
Moreover, it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded.	4.50643304896159
However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President.	2.9745831191077476
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years.	3.4738298296279266
Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies.	3.2664641492738338
However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly.	3.555376769889376
You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different.	3.6402918287378143
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2, which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas, particularly on maritime borders.	2.68566588117167
Although I welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the TSE regulation, I feel that the Commission' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and I shall submit amendments on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development to tighten up the proposals when the Roth-Behrendt report is debated.	3.1051992609292007
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication.	3.270099529485807
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution. We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders.	2.1595345177097434
Thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families, because man is not made for the law, but rather law is made for man.	2.633340030969926
The shift in meaning is not just semantic... The only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the realignment of European policy which our citizens hoped for.	2.498935245896069
I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy.	3.159195299525771
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	2.1940407872469962
I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged.	2.662935396315628
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease.	2.3971681842646912
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations.	2.5650949074985228
Is this not, indeed, what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament?	3.4073663534301692
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate, and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer.	3.2045358974408287
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	2.6604841733258664
My second brief comment is to thank the Portuguese Presidency, particularly Mr Seixas da Costa, for his proactive approach.	2.9561027221821163
Therefore we need to have credibility, coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens.	2.9289178948142216
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are, when all is said and done, on the global scale merely a peninsula.	2.6899976203993328
Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies.	2.743431676030554
That concludes Question Time.	1.201702454267055
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.	3.0051323536073498
We stand ready to do so.	2.1939774207435057
Thank you, Commissioner.	2.7613211830082482
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.	3.162852789369808
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	2.5130350395827494
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers.	1.9830870013067994
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	2.6543436512203864
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	1.9832899608990266
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people.	2.7265640966142373
A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State.	2.7671255172755975
I would, however, like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date.	3.151521055131305
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain.	2.2874428186261295
What has been done about training?	5.033140937893696
In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment.	2.5689345618772985
Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups.	3.5912122060655607
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks.	2.187235781567279
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline.	2.2359055845048403
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary.	2.5517491554929848
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	2.3835233942934098
Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report.	2.960329629401892
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.	2.8597955550967518
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need.	2.5838336091744045
It is all about creating a socially just Europe.	2.5088449279972753
My second question is of a critical nature.	2.5710307122734735
Over time, as I said a moment ago, not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise, its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged.	2.460421850274788
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	4.558272136017675
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	1.6335431514170666
We need to change tack completely.	5.052405300178785
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement.	3.0185209862063767
At the same time, it is, of course, essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid.	2.869961261441272
I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals they have put forward and I am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the European Parliament, on all the issues you have raised.	3.5633781355965177
As a result, the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task.	3.663015138247609
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility.	1.8657089007263032
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives.	1.8374537034444396
Soon, in May, the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union' s external relations.	4.51744683406022
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	3.1723040662915802
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important.	2.136888870414987
We must also ensure that Amendment No 45 by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil is amended if it is to be adopted, because the same problem will arise.	3.8652499695072784
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this.	3.8825636084725317
The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance.	2.7402215066319235
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product' s life-cycle. Instead, we should avoid creating so much waste.	2.657228911255022
And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action.	2.47540405507751
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light?	2.9580468700621263
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply.	2.7426237623950875
As has always been the case, there are offences that transcend European offences, as it were, or at least there is the potential for them to do so, and these might include money-laundering, receiving stolen goods, and forming a criminal organisation.	2.926864747242152
It very much remains to be seen whether these New Lands will be safe in terms of public health.	2.374550864534696
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	2.2256687263740598
The handover will have been made, but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made, by yourself, Mr President, and by the Portuguese Presidency, are going to be extremely important, as is the nature of this handover.	4.6793413734667535
And we should say so very clearly, it will involve more savings on services, more third systems, more reductions in average working hours, whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things.	2.1686286140294477
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	3.1595798625422478
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing.	2.1391135656465066
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise.	2.4504153394717734
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent.	2.777739329032215
Thus, when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe.	2.7195200975711757
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one.	3.5295547022798806
What Parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the Commission and Council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs.	2.8514804048379125
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology.	2.6395083959015233
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	1.745696230309817
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it.	3.1478684563923984
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas.	2.1004142994058483
Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies.	2.96506348198876
Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for.	2.340733957095084
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order.	2.567964995660194
Without these prospects that we have outlined, Europe would, once again, have no future.	2.945902798642799
They were treated like the worst criminals.	1.576342499531728
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.	2.2813589634990534
In order to ensure that at least 50% of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources, it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term.	3.9419600847930267
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control?	1.7525708750169973
Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid.	3.583879230517791
We all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause-effect relationship between tourism and employment. It is also due to the recognition by the European Union, since the 1997 conference on these issues, of the enormous potential, represented by tourism, for employment.	3.3479681049643366
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	2.757725710678679
That is not the sort of postal service that we want.	4.332974331270537
In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	2.5183342939330946
Let us look at some of these reasons.	3.1932635890014223
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement.	3.5427559862232436
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	1.6014937669238951
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	2.6552041116178913
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal.	4.023926586885829
What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	1.7680538846376845
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	2.6478189232734572
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment.	2.9967830092297367
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.	3.181447016471633
When it is, then, still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes, the question of legitimacy arises.	3.6380808848165476
I do not think so.	4.9501349135169335
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].	2.286538137656796
The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency.	3.5106255365236234
Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	3.021117137648882
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question.	5.020688660151625
Our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples, hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment.	2.4739473670524146
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea.	1.6983770102724451
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values.	2.326114470859119
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union.	2.232924755142894
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success.	2.703899969663643
Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House.	2.263737924879228
Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China.	3.0554567027372115
We are asking workers to be flexible, innovative and ever more productive, yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone.	1.9902472621661151
I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop.	2.8538759761413766
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions.	4.404379869386886
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law.	2.236201308497076
It is fine, in principle.	2.2698972247636653
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	3.0717954731055217
In mixed fisheries, you cannot discriminate.	1.7211248749345913
Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.	2.735358375756266
I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced.	2.6403700547889692
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better.	3.033670728695577
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters, such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary, from happening to us.	2.3875929413005994
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop.	2.6230852948860797
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	3.161172431985412
Even in Member States and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos, in situations where there are inadequate facilities, where schooling is very poor, where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife.	2.2431273848620426
In all matters, we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision-making procedures involved in EU cooperation, for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control.	3.2608190956173737
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	3.964806141806416
I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion.	3.316160820273036
The next item is the report (A5-0033/2000), by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)].	2.187516331640261
On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated.	2.5947146906289658
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information.	3.0407161055937624
It is an obvious truth, and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators, that thanks to tourism, many Mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants, and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers emigrating.	2.6710008362634077
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers.	5.084282109470874
Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union.	2.889586306869196
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	3.7407481146714003
We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies.	2.8159016584155374
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	4.071206879217142
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken.	2.2690433209895575
In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force.	2.6406195812064865
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens.	2.295826774909848
As for the rest, if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - I think you spoke of a cooperative structure - I am ready and willing, on the basis of suggestions from MEPs - you will be acting within your role and I within mine - to relay these suggestions, provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the Structural Funds Regulation.	2.6455378714594397
We would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies.	3.018007722620986
There are different views on this.	2.4766772731971556
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba.	2.7828628037242833
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria.	3.3928323751070026
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe.	2.760141117110002
We are all aware that, to this end, it is essential for the Council to approve, as quickly as possible, the scoreboard which Commissioner Vitorino has the remit of establishing.	3.239663090281853
For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area.	3.5745798215752327
Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead.	2.0651523190662164
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States.	1.5555908158022047
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders.	2.40681592944014
We have, as the EPP-ED group, submitted all the recommendations of the Wise Men' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report, entirely changing the nature of the van Hulten report in committee.	3.230478910574341
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	2.9791149745435392
Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars.	2.2280537981297557
At Tampere the Heads of State and Government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the Member States as well as the situation in the countries of origin.	3.1064771464382734
I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.	3.4398876145682933
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget.	3.1223520589279112
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals.	2.5263470516511415
I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	3.0704506562433456
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement.	1.801707487713084
We must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste, recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars.	2.979817465906661
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned.	2.7919844654974058
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity.	2.998034502165413
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments.	1.8363852879208769
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me.	2.577199433357519
How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety?	2.330683744037467
From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens.	2.4251341878827954
But the figures tell the true story.	1.5935933943119915
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making.	2.0197075092756105
Commissioner Kinnock will, tomorrow, present his communication on reform.	1.7950106893354505
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.	1.9235755097265046
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments.	2.59126599069117
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities.	2.5896887705333778
In this regard, too, the Commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on, and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others.	2.6593872185541425
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step.	3.772625447149895
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report.	3.4897418235143887
In our opinion, the Union' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity, not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs.	3.042434121114371
In this respect, the ALTENER programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment, and help us to realise our ambition, in the interests of environmental protection, the economy and creating new jobs.	3.489005058369858
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal.	3.0747479623997367
. (FR) We are disappointed by the Council' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive.	3.7529759084959493
We must strike a balance between them.	2.170775473910313
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others.	3.585853063988834
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union.	3.1199053020249212
Indeed, we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many.	3.0837607490579924
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves.	2.376608380794231
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	3.004906822448846
How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know.	2.5796226527543835
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism.	2.8990977307117456
Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union.	3.0503196873381233
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right.	2.3457910655143146
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased.	2.1622900343701352
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise.	2.6001345586041684
Madam President, we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the Union, so that we can uphold them together.	4.772577978811698
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt.	2.9180869790294466
I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities.	3.7977394709578562
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature.	3.307775785770241
Of course, we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes, but everyone hoped that the Culture programme could help to promote, for example, the unique features of each cultural sector, even - and I could say especially - of the unique features of less well-known sectors.	2.891922503017731
At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified.	5.159501701792245
Madam President, we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party in Austria, which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part, and which sends our support to anti-racist groups within the democratic majority of the Austrian people.	3.0664883585928306
As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.	2.644583193976131
This requires anticipation, timely preparation and careful management of these processes.	1.668067688398777
We have achieved a compromise solution.	2.8239641598386394
The directive remains in place.	1.4265056266989757
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	2.644396969672213
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity.	3.01829620158336
If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future.	2.874244309291549
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment: search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.	2.075743933043252
It would be the first in a long time.	5.529374691398823
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence. This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds.	2.546832932081217
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	3.5781927956418373
This has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the NUTS III Sicilian provinces which have a frontier with Malta and to include all the regions of the Adriatic which share a frontier with Balkan regions.	2.1758190665318136
This is not the usual state of affairs.	3.854334981153689
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	3.155254679681397
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.	3.992091227985132
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes.	1.612125164152072
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy.	2.2966266265600557
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.	3.320352007243145
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.	2.4786547949111086
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial.	2.3565125162762035
The main problem is a financial one, namely who bears the cost?	2.23018462072841
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State.	2.866433746154825
It underlines the fact that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis, namely the unemployed, immigrants, refugees, women and the socially excluded.	2.9580434839747416
People are especially wary of GMOs.	1.9110763567808196
My intention is - and I insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of March, also coinciding with the Council of Ministers, and, of course, before the end of the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, for us to have texts to discuss.	3.548997384544218
In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	3.57944253096112
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation.	2.1555396200372763
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned.	2.4962218675357337
Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.'	2.4341545382155902
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	2.7641414339237533
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so.	2.396078380856605
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report, they are a step in the right direction.	2.2229200091883508
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present.	2.3552241127574773
However, we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective.	3.2118382991568346
In Agenda 2000, we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.	3.240520801354848
In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance.	3.3907843128156174
How do these operate within the European Parliament' s delegation to the ACP-EU' s Joint Assembly?	2.8471584133692875
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend.	2.747430867661695
We back the rapporteur' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions.	2.7928986475707163
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now.	3.188780185313856
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union.	2.50611044019256
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States.	3.1472733873080982
We will conduct this dialogue with our citizens, including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision-making or information centres.	2.6248722286612574
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme.	2.11357882947745
We Radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the House in order to consolidate this text, and for example, to request - just for the sake of mentioning Articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done, i.e., that the European Parliament should also be involved in drawing up the European Constitution and that a proposal be made for the European Parliament to adopt the amendments to the Treaty.	3.9249949807869937
Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming.	3.0008406220927
Some of them are our ACP partners.	3.215362805723374
Nevertheless, to avoid the customary circus, which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the Presidency of the Council, maybe Parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next Intergovernmental Conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years.	2.306080360406121
If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention.	3.021639561099065
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework.	2.939421608579164
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.	1.6248487127883589
We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area.	2.394298917071313
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute?	2.2812823019123893
This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.	2.2733362813274773
This, however, presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents.	3.112595021897938
I do not know, but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together.	3.0712469413755072
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	2.6586694616918556
And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need.	3.510474469183968
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February, the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water, coastal wasters, inland waters and groundwater.	2.367294728605651
We are all acting as if this is not really happening, but we all know that it is.	5.698451942388046
However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	3.409369631265316
As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for.	2.513242343683335
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community.	2.318763403344232
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House.	2.8100036613172326
At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism.	3.2148372359517126
That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals.	4.377583175915963
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC?	2.397285003596624
Finally, and I think this is important: why not have the honesty today to relay what was disclosed in a recent UN study explaining that, if Spain wishes to preserve its work, retirement and pension potential, it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year 2050?	2.6356984743778678
However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business.	3.084732730421421
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened.	2.1298542918140067
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report.	3.1285881523057917
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	2.7410052396394278
We are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in Kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and I mean people who originate from Kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates.	3.082465293495364
I say this just so that we know where we stand.	3.749404717414803
First, and the Commissioner has also confirmed this, because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets.	3.467380991720135
What is your opinion on that?	2.082562744363288
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma.	2.1534038712369887
Although the cause was unfortunate, it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament.	2.5820845978219107
From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider.	2.4539581731216207
Both parties were once part of the government.	3.6902062054436553
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.	2.3508148855494913
That is very much the right approach.	3.8830283968699004
If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament.	3.6608434648656005
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	3.4524110669352877
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme.	3.9093328125743705
It is equally important not to lose sight of the Iraq question, which no one discusses anymore, thereby relegating the problems of millions of women, elderly people and children, the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked, to oblivion.	2.7677917727196015
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard.	4.8682405603167735
My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women.	2.6663762497299217
This is also at the request of the citizens.	4.492840734555946
These discussions essentially cover four areas: security, the structure of government, territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation, as a result of the situation following the partition of the island.	2.4187178645626664
In other words, the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis.	2.7654663906807384
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	2.599594619894822
However, such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy.	2.797826900331893
The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission.	2.321295400178665
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain.	2.617086612655926
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.	3.586996829689735
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it, and there is no excuse for not taking action.	3.3394526173507852
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality.	2.666453231452977
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained.	3.936520504843169
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	1.8722459200772164
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	3.294387141619285
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements.	2.269054132364124
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762.	2.349870049391797
However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue.	3.587350917049089
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	3.4709038957419374
Yet I believe that, as this debate has shown, we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas.	4.546435284760572
I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective.	2.4733132381563547
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
In my opinion, it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law.	2.4870221400743877
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them.	2.778944040051157
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it?	2.4004729293211957
Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we already have a TÜV (organisation for safety testing) for ships in the form of the classification companies.	2.225430672073272
While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun, I think it is important to keep the two processes apart.	2.8530444207430423
Behind these principles, Mr President, lies the justice system.	3.606868761747655
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision.	3.0607159031097586
Unfortunately, the positions taken by the Commission and the Council, or at least the presidency, are more than just a hair' s breadth apart; this is serious, especially in the light of the Council' s macho position on Austria.	3.4787064914393557
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	2.3530533988502387
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared.	2.9324729357040424
For example, I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component, namely refugees.	3.530951455040065
Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction.	1.9503158573534285
We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999.	2.540543893238634
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control.	2.3852825769937516
I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture.	2.6316851852624032
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given.	2.517007434247027
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent.	2.403466742342259
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	2.197691340234038
But for pity' s sake, and I am not saying this to you in an aggressive way, please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms.	2.2055917619299668
Mr President of the Commission, this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament, a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission.	3.210727307617592
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	3.5100041819965697
I should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change, the depletion of primeval forests and overfishing, constantly affect our common and vital but, in some ways, unowned resources.	2.4996225120783353
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu, but with more unsatisfactory implications, restricting the Commission, so you say, to the task of drawing up a few White Papers, as you proposed.	3.66219411203567
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.	1.5149686678431384
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	2.3789161693760787
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	3.365881177545523
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms, including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority.	2.653178943925383
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country.	2.394461445884563
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	4.2343151602455
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	4.347700653956409
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	2.413852182880617
There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it.	3.9549801127753605
We regret this as there was actually money left over from the Structural Funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects. We should remember that it is these URBAN projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established.	2.4517207592048447
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one.	2.1500922815741594
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region.	2.740369447566983
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	3.1437872926634696
France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	3.8125106743216466
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4.	2.3125196123518355
The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle.	3.0343191956497693
A further round was held in January this year, starting on 31 January, and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York.	2.7943565117908507
My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	4.282132465202383
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration.	2.6261221489805786
First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted.	2.2051040364012686
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	3.013840635612972
It is about a Commission which is no more.	4.313183197317368
I know this is difficult to achieve now, but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers, here and elsewhere, and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries, here and elsewhere, it will be difficult to preserve jobs in Europe and outside it.	2.8475354944669498
We have been asked for EUR 35 million.	3.380707527181016
Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest.	3.4129954016426516
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	2.5881337791640577
As for the important educational task which the European Union must carry out as regards culture, one of the programme' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the Council at least - certainly not the Commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action: the document which prioritises the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this.	2.950680199213845
(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)	1.5428256063511423
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but, worst of all, their effect will be counter-productive.	2.8611270850354535
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete.	4.894052381498503
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	2.985344190599714
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this.	2.080245753723601
Our answer to this crucial question is no.	2.493290921582141
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule, despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years.	2.2691016395002617
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote.	2.4423136755166563
But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.	2.760655034878657
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority.	1.850913286635977
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population.	2.424174849105459
.	77.3301660757284
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.	2.749897274331972
The broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater, the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals, which we all need in society in all circumstances, should not be finding their way into our water system.	2.8373771871276467
Representatives of the Council, within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament.	4.1951978611794045
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.	3.506797505542396
There have only been nine rejections.	1.5509683996114982
In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy.	2.6195427430355664
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member.	3.277448116368112
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting, when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council, which is an unacceptable way to go on.	3.038636561524519
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.	2.9999490859368123
Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice.	2.4016726725016557
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him.	3.834250756294202
My group, as Mr Kindermann has already said, will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise.	3.462879660503031
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	3.5313858345833697
We have arrived at the final question.	2.1393306993628043
Question No 51 by (H-0049/00):	1.1672026996941478
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	2.2866170460046753
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid.	1.9984529425693065
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	2.5673268993656024
The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions.	1.8482570665520923
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds.	2.538964743148009
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power.	3.8004535818883283
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	3.0788078396410143
That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive.	3.489037773174271
The principle also concerns water charging.	1.523144544009216
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers.	2.7311331421074523
Once again, the individuality, dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest.	2.170900116528684
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	2.4036305454056843
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built.	6.338887568273157
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	4.1854314684259935
Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them.	2.494051180736526
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.	2.1216028076743627
In this regard, too, the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission.	4.4056639798534345
If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again.	2.691959089917394
In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999.	2.9602709060731582
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate?	1.9499149976760668
These worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this; I think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem, that is, to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements.	3.381522061634039
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation.	6.671411939240526
In addition, I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.	2.5951868474687636
The first comment, which has been made by many others too, is whether women should be mentioned separately.	2.7698143036330944
Regarding the fight against organised crime, 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the Vienna action plan, which resulted in the signing of the Charter of European Professional Associations, in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the Member States for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering. And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group.	2.6630440170459444
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.	3.3822188588915
The goal is, after all, to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates, in the first place, but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights.	2.7148978634593623
Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work.	3.263308229488783
Mr President, I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday.	2.7945624022422715
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out.	3.2824861568566273
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem, either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or, if possible, before then.	3.557740625766244
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	2.714344561143397
According to our information, the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet.	2.950481848816893
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions.	2.605924970787668
On the contrary, it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history.	3.1811789315929406
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation.	1.5920904639152844
Your President, Mrs Fontaine, has agreed to take part with Mr Prodi and several Commissioners in this initial dialogue. I can assure you that, whenever a Commissioner intends to engage in dialogue, the most immediately available MEPs will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the European Parliament.	2.9895196941104545
I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties.	2.8389749697259696
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months.	3.25936156916968
I should like to mention a few specific points.	3.277615925307669
Nonetheless, there are many maritime areas between which links are already established.	2.509968570759395
Mr President, I am grateful for the Council' s oral, and also written, reply.	4.053376970130818
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly.	3.241144091057895
Given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced, I voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant States and the Union, but also because I believe that this should be taken as an invitation from Parliament to the Council and the Commission to ensure that Cyprus and Malta become fully-fledged members of the European Union as swiftly as possible.	3.5183444230822998
This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested.	3.269242845817043
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.	1.5023331331914211
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets.	3.117182928701471
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	2.2447674947943375
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	3.052430122410079
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	3.2344542022257126
I hope that next time, also if any other airline company is involved, things will run more smoothly.	2.200852994969827
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously.	2.479309953696041
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so.	2.930553550114889
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner.	2.665777878928446
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	3.325185244610688
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	3.225788503150634
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement.	4.382724554440298
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one.	2.1704897542902364
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative.	3.447908420200024
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	1.1985863527265117
(Parliament approved the joint text)	2.692565634831119
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million, mainly for food, medical supplies, water and sanitation.	2.2918501755623795
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report, which is unfortunate.	5.206705513304439
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	2.7546814817178578
This will therefore be our rule.	2.812507609434208
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion, namely to budget the European Development Fund.	3.116108185181013
No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50.	2.1080133820307347
And then we see that, increasingly, the regions, the various operators, businesses, associations, are submitting LIFE projects, both for LIFE-NATURE and LIFE-ENVIRONMENT, projects that are of excellent quality, which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of European Union support, but we still cannot fund them, for lack of budget appropriations.	2.3482522759891657
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control' s proposal this week and grants discharge, then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque.	3.445083843178009
However, I should like to stress INTERREG' s particular importance for the Balkan area, where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country, Greece, which is the only Member State on that long-suffering peninsula.	2.5397998334170095
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	2.306374194032856
You perhaps know that, in Finland, the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader, but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion.	2.6568199289209873
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument.	3.154536794224885
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed, as others have been, by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism.	2.1756022418508003
It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips.	2.090354625036871
Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother.	3.1108594017399294
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development.	2.9396825143075946
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	3.4652618064368146
Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe.	2.384624626899672
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	3.653104101535691
We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive.	3.3005492287057723
Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about.	4.12875209554809
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project.	3.5503250121360317
The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale.	2.524266373976644
These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State.	2.24451051884608
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission's accountability to this Parliament.	3.7708116852644062
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	3.469597467976884
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure.	2.3840680637933875
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry.	2.3392029152699423
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe, it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business, that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back.	2.984425953762545
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today.	4.244407449230889
(Loud applause)	1.1492569002612767
What the stricken populations are waiting for now, those who have lost everything, particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism, those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come, is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused, but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future.	2.3763417440345447
We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further.	2.185015098877761
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible.	1.9029029829270896
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite.	1.782718388069487
In our opinion, each one must be free to make its own organisational choices.	2.4615699715419264
It seems to me that in order for the European Union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the European Union it must give assistance to Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and their families.	3.9374929689698708
This means that the ceiling of 0.25% mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance.	3.918389787258094
Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	3.9891840695315985
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process.	1.7121588428374142
Fourthly, I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules.	3.1428425331738845
As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.	2.9652437102676084
With closed production circuits this is possible; anything else would water down the directive.	1.7616426422072413
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake.	2.6519359828301194
The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures.	3.202055812184739
Honourable Members, Commissioner, it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector, but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector.	3.3037016463203854
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	2.611025763613087
Do you think I am going over the top?	3.0774976982394864
They will be told that they are too expensive, without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services, where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas.	2.0573449730918525
We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums.	1.4352224910989235
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes, namely, the new INTERREG III initiative, EQUAL and the LEADER+ scheme.	3.014803946998764
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector.	3.6391221109251983
The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid.	2.9934766001034494
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved?	2.831915716634546
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe.	2.296405690880522
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes.	2.3590970842177956
National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	3.4776646861144966
Atrocities were not even being recorded.	1.8819838680477579
I look forward to the next round.	5.0224467922456935
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	3.0257276406037956
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward.	2.377944848236424
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis.	2.678868871989835
Madam President, the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision, as a European, of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe.	3.567629098371009
Press freedom in Angola	1.7134805795525148
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements.	3.9926972696160514
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction.	2.950875117143082
As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%).	2.936741479766149
The laws against racism must be harmonised.	1.66386908079826
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks, but what I am really saying to you Commissioner, and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again: There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen.	3.153835757356516
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider.	2.624807814062058
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	4.093697371090516
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica?	2.3197599775926117
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives, in which one' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services.	2.4841641861322588
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation.	2.113839751139521
They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation.	3.4313893215123126
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	2.5978209881830545
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	2.9577711300240743
Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you.	2.0414340442571937
I am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas, about consolidating and improving the European dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in Europe especially lifelong learning.	2.2801318166069553
So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made.	2.2480031273615766
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	3.803685560281013
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying.	3.2314343794405613
The stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various Member States, despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the Member States where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit.	3.639587061884325
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective.	1.937229830130667
Finally, I have certainly believed for a long time, coming from an agricultural background myself, that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal feedstuffs had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had BSE in the first place.	2.612512181548203
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State, whichever one it may be.	3.0306648341354614
Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this.	4.783968591113478
What are we doing about it?	2.798911052757372
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission.	2.7714080471592224
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	4.253996103904185
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	2.843159316741528
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment, so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account, and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment.	3.102672042219679
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles.	2.736039785478148
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility.	3.4388079169440395
Firstly, at the beginning of 1999, NATO, with the participation of most Member States of the European Union, flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom.	3.5527527910913888
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence.	2.264765051518475
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this.	3.801912488692112
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work?	1.5906841800653415
Mr President, as well as discrediting the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country - who have the kind of attitude which, in the case of Ireland, deserved the Nobel prize - by calling them Nazis, the declaration insults representatives of the European citizens - as in my case: I represent a section of Galician society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the Nazis, and insults groups which are clearly democratic, with decades of history, in an unacceptable and crazy way, which I would like to condemn here and now.	3.0923830059187343
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council.	2.6472582205007926
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle.	1.8923596957351307
He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve.	2.201116547130559
The crisis in last year' s Commission has been solved today, but the Commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach, which, no doubt, the entire Parliament will soon demand in the resolution.	3.1884982038668164
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.	2.2127889570097383
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important.	2.3641917868141658
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.	6.7849863590964805
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary.	3.0310437908796977
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter.	2.494181879092967
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference.	3.8070638813709405
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.	2.0595778150640816
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps.	3.0815621528496453
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle?	1.7772944558660082
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.	2.532665302240281
Much like in the Netherlands, where, at a given point, women woke up to the fact that, by referring to European legislation, they could improve their status in terms of social security, this is now also the case for scores of other citizens.	3.434113030644498
You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech.	3.1029253873024776
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	3.5827053669879185
In particular, we intend that the European Union should maintain a constant profile on this issue, and of course all the more so since Cyprus is a candidate for membership of the European Union with negotiations at a fairly advanced stage. This naturally raises certain expectations and means that the role of the European Union is of some relevance in this context.	3.0504101987437133
If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result.	1.6529255744837181
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way.	2.9831968555663453
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length.	2.811986086277956
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.	3.611182498957525
I believe we can learn something from this.	3.4778493891398283
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	3.1454776215402
The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly.	3.1728396607624756
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	2.437412790908545
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	5.989222636946282
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas.	2.139805217723823
Where is the beef?	1.7947221343217445
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle.	2.692987580046169
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	2.0505567069776593
On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	3.156074940127332
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood.	4.775086309682739
This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme.	2.6198767600196167
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring?	2.4904247417246457
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.	2.6766169202979384
Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility.	1.9508083559374139
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.	3.0568344333944477
Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water.	3.903905647983976
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate.	2.73993054245798
Commissioner, I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures.	3.4122503286459316
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.	3.341677283268346
A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing.	6.132946936899683
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	2.577347230820385
As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million.	2.8638413409214007
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them.	3.291110961678859
I should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism, the tourism exported from the Member States of the European Union. I am referring to sex tourism.	3.131392756866706
For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	4.207192171883396
Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned.	4.076338873471232
The Left' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere.	2.3911957583157633
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	2.039791667169982
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	3.345732408586432
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	3.3674331919904223
On the other hand, the decision to delay the second round of talks, initiated in Shepherdstown by the Syrian Arab Republic, is undoubtedly significant, but I am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 January in that town will not be dashed.	2.5530926070882805
For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that "the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems" .	3.676567746606735
Why is it so important in that sector?	1.801754651886803
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	3.1870003613375983
Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	3.4897351480394407
(Limited applause)	1.2042721718105043
For the time being, please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin.	2.6260998813869247
In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece?	2.8589914935230385
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy.	1.571849716064194
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982.	2.796928874403908
Report (A5-0015/2000) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (COM(1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168(CNS))	1.8982719282518294
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.	2.7278461869638257
As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing.	3.380424184285815
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo.	2.389422738832443
Rather, the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me.	3.1503351936299464
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings.	2.8051519872899626
In more general terms, this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants.	2.332099778034847
Will the Commission remain silent?	3.621255991501063
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.	2.117401686666642
The refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget; the motion of censure tabled in this House a year ago for differing reasons; and the first report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the reform of the Commission which led to the mass resignation of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.	3.122351807111619
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	2.3009637741669295
We think they should.	2.4876225110102403
As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.	2.540184457628186
That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used.	3.523072916227625
We must start by going beyond man, who is not the master of the universe, to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values, without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and bloodshed.	2.2607465685371557
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted.	1.8178136815717056
I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks.	2.736589825990503
We have experienced this in our own national and European history. People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant.	2.3522761776217718
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used.	1.8716544062641696
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	2.6889815738707123
Furthermore, it should be the case that, if the Court of Auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running, the management should be held responsible for it, and this will have an effect on chances of promotion.	3.1756668600384295
It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions.	4.027195030136422
The Commission document too, which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon, takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas.	2.6182809763737107
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria.	3.9854437748865026
Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men.	3.4832497737082133
Mr President, some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film, "Cocoon", in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again.	3.2224242104300918
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion, thereby accounting for roughly 75% of all funds assets.	2.1874244622040853
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards.	1.8989018695476225
This must be brought forward.	7.015028852951107
But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field.	2.6252140334487013
In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden.	2.623487379888535
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident.	2.570071027734883
But we shall have a decision very soon.	2.851804172278297
It is, of course, a peace process which is finally under way.	2.8442126994283794
The Commission' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point.	3.8042283770397836
From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest.	2.410055789939741
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again.	2.2932674948193714
After all, it is only 1% of GDP, by comparison with national spending.	3.950701961921424
And do you know why?	1.8306555589479172
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	2.8151630459474397
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this.	1.9414217614836704
One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context.	4.345711751380996
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	3.4179161838285284
What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	2.7475630308937915
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC.	2.2731412550760393
We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba which respects the principles of the market, the sanctity of contract and the rule of law.	3.1822651334369696
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.	2.8795260023840674
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.	3.171470738108291
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70/524 on genetically modified additives at this stage.	3.21719670489372
It damages Parliament.	1.296214832761664
There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers.	2.8136831955841126
Nevertheless, we believe, and I think this is also how the Commission sees things, that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the European Union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible. It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession, as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions.	3.2032159995497866
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.	2.193916527976104
Would this be in the interests of Europe's citizens?	3.9354973498730446
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right.	4.027065414115989
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry?	2.0796890578414837
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness.	1.9608704877783811
Instead of fighting amongst themselves, public postal services should cooperate, take staff on and guarantee decent, stable working conditions, while meeting the needs of service users in terms of both post delivery and savings bank services.	2.064062405783385
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts.	2.324019285887876
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive.	2.9938265848103667
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	2.1575395559383312
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from?	1.7927011208600534
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies, who should be working together rather than against one another.	1.9069568412533031
Berend Report (A5-0107/1999)	1.288342709821954
I propose, therefore, that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda, with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date.	3.2022271759151915
This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	2.8735733070864913
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	3.0512268955967956
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba.	4.0830854019033564
Regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - I believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up, in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one.	2.873176485303648
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	2.226036437124592
Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements.	4.950020034990106
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority.	3.2302681180712245
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	2.6319299876422155
The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism.	2.6186620224764052
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	2.5090885709985202
Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question.	3.403118246805722
Mr President, the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all.	3.3843135690681536
I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed.	3.0014372988593805
Every time, just as the exchange was about to take place, we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists.	2.839186465064769
Ladies and gentlemen, on this point we must make it clear: in the context of subsidiarity, the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States.	3.2085189939783385
Nor is it a mere luxury.	2.530585835648427
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	2.8249180660843325
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand.	2.907765850931053
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world.	2.717659681135621
I wish to recall that it is, in principle, up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules, if and when they are brought before them by national representatives.	3.2532625561856676
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade.	3.4512647205063827
In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows.	2.859842211125994
Quite, we agree absolutely.	1.7174592048492414
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight.	3.9587052744911646
We think there are other positive advances too.	2.3032769960645787
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	3.190992536973002
Mr President, I seem to recall from my study of European history, that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job.	2.7538903290721355
On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us.	1.8770171488816638
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists.	1.6460852236906873
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	2.8452018654411004
Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing.	2.6870700545434634
I very much welcome the Commission's support for that bizonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the UN has campaigned for so long and which both the Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot side should be working hard to bring about.	2.87474157080482
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout.	4.279806535962635
Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions.	2.600478454562254
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	3.0637297830801766
In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges.	2.4520598124375765
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted.	2.954731547006495
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	4.2874223518486785
I am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high-level working group report, your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy.	3.4643059070919002
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home.	2.9442622002859946
I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing.	2.6953601825972906
Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor.	2.441456385071601
Parliament has completed the agenda.	1.525518864552451
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work.	2.801774829238474
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	3.8877113224905506
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if the world is turned upside down.	2.853925283232483
Mr President, we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection.	3.5178971114128577
In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences!	1.9530156736278463
In recent years, these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union.	3.04526366365631
Madam President, on a point of order.	3.5188712904074
My Group assumes that Margot Wallström will promise to provide aid to those communities which have been affected: economic aid, support in terms of environmental expertise and help in connection with the massive cleaning-up operation which is required.	2.357766168810719
If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services.	2.6929969109524614
For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals.	3.303560326702944
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	3.0780563924834494
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
In recent years, the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States.	2.247885415017002
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit.	2.997202836701473
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	2.413417163186143
Let us mention, for example, the disturbing lack of public interest, the definition of monetary policy objectives abusively reduced to the mere fight against inflation, the strange coupling of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism, the status of the present applicant countries, when they become members, vis-à-vis the euro zone, the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no homogeneous popular foundation, and so on. Do I also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20% since 1 January 1999, 40% if they bought bonds, and no less than 55% if they sold yen to buy euros?	2.2148712697362085
Mr President, firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach.	4.826018069071844
Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible.	3.9560805951180082
Unfortunately, it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission.	3.2125067655072077
I have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the URBAN programme conditional upon certain guarantees, firstly on concentration - I am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or, in exceptional cases, 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding: we must keep to EUR 500 per inhabitant so that the European Union action may be both effective and clear, and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities.	2.7013904512492948
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week.	2.20319558161978
In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament?	3.1107831784231843
There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years.	2.463299175112828
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	3.2800882999205627
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem.	2.7432528713406654
However, the appointment was cancelled at the last minute.	3.265485322172406
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	3.05981344936819
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	3.0866857194999673
The European Union' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy.	3.470962469582719
- (FR) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Women and Science' .	3.182233350465931
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	3.6750294660727314
This is why we urge the Commission, in this sharp and clear resolution, to develop specific instruments.	3.9405390690018964
The postal service is also the doctor.	3.8197026643660985
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	2.6591346581222712
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies.	3.3958248781307496
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.	1.595287799940518
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either.	2.0933287897895623
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end.	5.106570883419881
This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control.	1.977484722047594
To delay, or perhaps even risk damage to the euro, would be indefensible.	3.041445264425277
The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain' s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students' mutual insurance company.	3.2710523136651006
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed.	2.534399037846174
Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned.	2.357029895336341
We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	3.484504423208156
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom.	2.5893597057262583
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	2.3267943801421005
Especially in situations of war, civilians are given less consideration all the time.	1.852704647705163
It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States.	3.5733478063353554
In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results.	2.3353966295930118
Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women.	2.974017484381703
Madam President, reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process.	3.6488675035433413
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.	4.46396534087027
Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop.	2.39808802223122
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report, but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all.	2.8641334100944356
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	2.0450132838739448
To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required.	1.546362872979033
Now that is where the difficulties begin, because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the Treaty of Maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to frighten the voters by over-egging the pudding.	2.4143889119796342
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this.	3.8325910127893774
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	2.076834782344252
As I said at the beginning, the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed.	3.340757046734038
Until 1999, this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols (B7-4011).	1.8861843804962566
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	2.790414596776395
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities.	3.7507138365522583
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making.	2.491505256004994
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	3.7517238908723822
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	1.4528460865764674
I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	3.8024557014851745
However, the Commission believes that we must go further.	7.65901079585286
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	3.3277702552647983
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration.	2.993756262870697
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, yet still you attach too little importance to these areas.	1.7076980268240507
Obviously, he said "the federal solution would be best" .	1.5163579731547132
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	2.7650054852668404
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report.	2.1496591695708753
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment, and only international solidarity can save them.	2.3277164229755343
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment.	3.643549174610349
In relation to Mrs Lynne's question on interim payments: that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues.	2.751181302414088
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning.	3.120402604524669
I adamantly believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation, but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles, created by what Alan Greenspan calls irrationally exuberant markets, burst.	2.3497937317874276
On the one hand, it continued to refuse to accept the term "European cultural policy" or other similar terms, even undervaluing the terms of the Treaty, and it defines "Culture 2000" simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more.	2.741163066689427
In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	3.512962297575655
It is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation, although that is part of it, but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them.	2.795232033491899
We, Euskal Herritarrok, have regretted many times the loss of human lives.	1.8711354405488374
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	1.8720318426989786
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report.	1.8046038902916477
The efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally, and I say that because in the MEDA programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome, so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme.	2.9486440902538855
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, it becomes clear that the European Union' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful.	3.1559763724459393
I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions.	4.08599459999371
We have to be aware of this.	7.816619060953517
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284.	2.3342605263069296
Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations?	3.3591892002878008
A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes.	2.535296126489161
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners. The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment.	2.20442115214637
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap.	1.6696678712570665
We have to remedy that.	6.789804211939154
A man with three children and he was murdered.	1.5117864017012763
I would like more information on this, because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services.	3.3373827787572203
There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent.	2.925662863626642
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	2.7177571544747274
We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights.	2.717459541599176
Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising.	3.1151359373951704
Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.	2.586475889168772
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us.	3.1595363268410215
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.	2.402763836374919
So, unification in this small area.	1.54438530512871
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.	2.5759114743248963
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations, both in the public sector and in the private sector, in the last decade or so.	2.804474441038329
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	3.465950689534073
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes.	2.7334343049965835
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	2.869181652900094
Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report.	3.57790370213192
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	2.2243371603105424
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	3.494673759002754
Why not?	2265.4179776959077
That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly?	2.662413458237687
We need to take this responsibility seriously.	7.2675864945400415
Thank you, Mrs Wallström.	4.407454488279714
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential.	2.1580428481399276
I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones.	2.8429187472703203
This first step is so important because of this model function.	3.189169681508824
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate.	2.651124206868313
I did not hide behind any immunity.	2.6624883680043405
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	1.4908831082950498
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint.	3.1234542247237194
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	3.2188690273221137
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive.	2.4156120446529763
Mr President, this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations, contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level, and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement, I repeat, I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary, inter alia, for negotiating and concluding an association agreement.	2.5483294256917075
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority.	2.547239818567745
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control.	2.89847415240278
I hope that the forthcoming visit by the President of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations, will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.	3.080707387226966
The European Parliament needs to acquire the resources, which it currently lacks, to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures, and the Commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to Parliament and ensure that control can be effective.	3.0805179078767995
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe.	2.889446766256301
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent.	3.363916628701513
weighting of votes in the Council	1.2635829268865066
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists.	3.688690768121428
Questions to Mrs Wallström	1.9248345851994193
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	2.1003631698266227
I would quote Gaza as an example.	2.144664184634606
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts.	2.596707403683766
The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial.	2.3823689315758085
Overall, I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position.	2.7286646037453113
Neither is correct.	1.7267203483381122
Clearly, the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non-polluting systems, seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage, particularly our water resources.	2.3071066798695505
Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all.	2.2450250121045974
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission.	2.139611774420044
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	4.660332764556421
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.	2.7238508007436706
We await the outcome with great interest.	2.5199549131733465
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.	2.1778225636059867
In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	3.1179922570652296
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations.	2.4642109658637095
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended	1.7452803653452686
Question No 37 by (H-0029/00):	1.1672026996941478
Other issues have been mentioned: cattle-farming in Namibia, tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean.	2.828111250387485
The postal services are important.	5.208224320550011
Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content.	2.7344777021606386
This issue is extremely serious.	3.627897119044707
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time.	2.9016319633773384
If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters.	2.614110131441373
We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told.	2.4438968350342622
We would then be overreaching ourselves.	2.560760138558338
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them.	3.0341476460296017
Under those conditions, then, there has been a real failure.	3.2834846705704273
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	2.389409598723588
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law.	3.326648870578924
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	3.33393994264144
Why not institute an oil boycott against Sudan, where a great deal of the fighting is still going on, with weapons, no less, funded by the oil companies which are based in the same areas where the refugees are?	2.392307063649479
I would like to say that in Italy, considerable headway has been made in this sector; we are perhaps the first in Europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market, but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high, and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market.	2.9601443005882513
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved.	3.3469277171462095
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now.	1.9784203528239679
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles.	2.2606471455221904
Before 20 January last, during nineteen months, the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, member of ETA, in March 1999.	1.833598299399726
One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated.	2.5671922762935235
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	4.151161839699496
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and, on the contrary, to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments, which they urgently need.	2.7816158190178446
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	2.968253219418834
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis.	2.21376815371691
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available.	3.3403167260100814
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future.	2.899852414277736
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	2.619795907429657
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute, which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath.	2.7861135639966714
We would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the Commission, but also of this Parliament, and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so.	3.1953977146359147
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	2.454997366904895
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible.	3.9580599753178807
We will also have to await the outcome of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference as regards enlargement, to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the European Union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies, and, as regards development in particular, to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective.	3.3503045931201427
That would be a similar situation.	5.7235747400967405
Neither will it stop raising vital issues. For example, how much progress are you willing to make and what measures, legislative or otherwise, will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings, child pornography on the Internet, drugs, and organised crime?	2.1533830990800293
Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round.	3.4748401418488393
Let me name just two small ones: the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria.	2.358164289735101
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described.	3.6053416553334885
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions.	3.6175944283382506
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	1.8223935263639264
In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle.	2.7789011986291245
It is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved.	3.010828258963999
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries.	4.92568279670407
In its present form, the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets, in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them.	3.4909472961695034
Moreover, several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus.	2.338583524291917
This is unusual, but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes.	1.9323213126210386
Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least.	3.357862572048334
We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators.	2.5649622389713556
The Council, Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive.	3.0608037942486788
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing.	1.598666585860257
The flooding has been going for weeks, and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need.	2.416086884482108
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed.	2.7015451737465397
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.	2.9800679840472193
To a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and, by realigning old procedures with the new situation, we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past.	2.3748668621891174
Mr President, Commissioner, Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union.	3.377920467801896
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	3.1312673357638543
However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic.	2.8332010013523496
Community policy in the field of water	3.1675064091307283
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe, I am in favour of not making competition unequal but, in terms of environmental protection, I want freedom from costs for the last owner, to be financed by a special fund, and manufacturer responsibility for new cars, which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars!	3.2987693417757598
I look forward to Parliament' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward.	2.637923405191087
I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land.	2.0730436782669575
Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States?	3.554919119237091
We can do this by, as a Parliament, amending the Council' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment.	3.1077021958075313
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.	3.039693000559226
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area, lest it miss out on a historic opportunity, and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean.	2.8120677772213116
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few.	2.70106564966192
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers!	5.524637222281522
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	2.0942036228528313
It must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate, fair and transparent democratic debate, namely at national level in the main.	2.338766970380728
We are all aware of the difficulties, and particularly the financial difficulties, that Mr Kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery, and, in particular, we are aware of the special difficulty involved in recruiting police so as to ensure day-to-day public safety.	3.0071342544605044
Nevertheless, I have said that I understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the Commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations, but since this is all about Agenda 2000 and the Financial Perspective, we will not be able to do this without amending this Financial Perspective.	4.256113489370299
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable?	2.831581018891542
The most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services, where problems exist, improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the Action Plan for Employment.	2.741575286077389
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire.	2.0086778569010098
These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.	2.1321940033824394
This is the essence of how I understand the situation: we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly, that, basically, the Members of Parliament should drop their claims, particularly claims on the budget, for if we do not soon, in line with the codecision procedure, get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for LIFE, then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay, and in the meantime the NGOs and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations.	3.032099117715555
We believe that justice should be done in this case, but this is not the most appropriate procedure.	5.160311799087343
Mr President, I see two problems with this morning' s debate.	3.501770817047299
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground.	2.0329053678172695
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive.	4.251969050346555
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly.	2.6759714279399516
Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive.	2.376720872687813
In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry.	2.443726506823985
Clearly, Parliament has its own representatives present, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos.	2.3486825610212327
They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors.	3.938144192314333
This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	3.509741672680103
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless.	3.011367244702264
However, this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium.	2.257792819821684
In essence, FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia, regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy.	2.7524149367245085
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	2.939263221535348
This has been talked about for years.	2.805837542105911
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993.	2.381496428796885
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility.	2.966434210546123
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	2.616570808379406
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this.	3.150899182602806
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	3.464153828248833
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.	2.651965881727616
It is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from Gothenburg to somewhere else in Europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage.	3.122795348356359
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020.	2.1334438923446895
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	3.001185841734012
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	2.0962180132423507
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union, for which the Commission is responsible.	5.711797279963526
This means that, when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences, job losses for example, companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution.	2.2178764502275716
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned.	3.4578479805102535
We wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the Member States, even if the enlargement of the EU requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past.	3.5410769559994244
So this is what we are going to do.	5.285944665029071
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used.	3.349753284005285
Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	2.799901555637129
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise.	2.5494674290709773
It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed.	1.767474635040661
As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today.	3.3215576286048636
What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this:	4.792941024782715
First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle.	3.928840219822104
The problem considered by the motion is a major one but, as has already been touched upon, could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in Angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster.	2.8083251036613657
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	2.5567979924231934
In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries.	2.610930069642092
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility.	3.783752080285926
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, "Never again!"	2.360496136991391
In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	3.6138769621449582
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels?	1.575113439815085
Under no circumstances can we, as responsible politicians, allow what is currently happening to continue, with young girls practically bought in the countries of the East and coming here to be abused on the cheap.	2.124967360009207
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay, although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases.	1.7939535002192581
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union' s cooperation policy is this: how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping.	2.9739330764416714
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	2.7747612877461605
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium.	3.221902175112483
Certain sectors of European industry, such as the shipbuilding industry, air transport and the steel industry, which have been hard hit by existing competition policy, have suffered tremendously.	2.732801716854484
Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes.	3.7014284655003595
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information.	2.8499834989354182
This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn.	3.000693225323493
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.	2.0508675312030644
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	2.7693665716335247
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon.	3.1277463033868247
Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS))	2.1265539763601553
Thank you, Mr Davies.	5.723731275202819
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case.	2.6638592476401235
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems.	3.2076653332351204
It is extremely important.	2.5903080973888475
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	2.4153066564631382
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?	2.194904197540063
Our priority, as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up, is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States.	2.7941378643017094
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	2.7987279991921903
We have had all that before but some people in this Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80% of these resources are spent by the Member States.	3.1216538769538187
Note that this proposed tax, which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people, would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation. Yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere.	2.409498768314214
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution.	2.598472441154134
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive.	2.607544188465035
Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable.	4.376604214559381
I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again.	4.91284879888273
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one.	2.113026724446156
Despite yesterday' s figures, we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2% in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued. However, the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments.	3.0583843585055024
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils.	2.1821551630415215
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species.	2.9256102415015994
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days.	2.1524061396093654
Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President.	3.011537385950464
In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans.	2.7873685944279374
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation.	3.2010815067144627
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	1.5213880690401185
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.	2.2767463442951974
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.	3.4576766863787642
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	2.640302661641021
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging.	2.4078394582730795
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and, to do this, the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time.	3.4094889855761377
Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld.	3.0249335354223663
The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here.	2.2546424445247633
Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament?	3.142627374876933
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms.	1.75982271305967
Recently, I have noticed that the Commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner, precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility, both for products and for services.	3.1997439550646787
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	2.4094308679934695
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	4.118356762002804
But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council represent too much of a step backwards, which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us.	3.7373290795802334
But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy.	3.48231989620375
Here we must ensure that the good schemes, those which are really excellent, are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work.	2.7882772506042426
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market.	2.341762980661228
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts.	5.722079747759927
In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached?	2.819325692383451
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	2.1279714463749295
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence, enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure.	2.793628931269299
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage.	2.028142616414521
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there?	3.0693862104695704
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	2.1831524845848205
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	2.7022602251269103
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	2.5554712534343422
Agriculture and health: we see the issue differently from the Commission: in our view there are no consumers: there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health, quality and respect for the environment.	2.6167544279788353
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another.	3.33513631079773
Mr President, we are partly to blame for this war.	4.738373488140833
In this sense, the Commission must insist, and I should like to endorse and confirm this here, that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding, enforceable rights.	3.9622544807673292
Financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001. It will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the Intergovernmental Conference and the ratification process.	2.528740066465904
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible.	2.689299018038897
As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income.	2.3944306454060884
Mr President, you are a symbol of these changes.	6.760777258828488
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world, not one of them, however, is an Arab state included in the EU' s Barcelona process.	4.145898112446541
The victims are waiting outside.	1.570943352804695
Commissioner Liikanen, we expect an authoritative intervention.	2.0506953972849624
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.	2.5307777247225256
On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000.	4.16903571495353
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination, as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.	3.0134535932110214
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report. I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented.	2.6162723099389127
It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications.	2.881060705239638
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark.	2.0088636793154135
I would ask you, now that you are President of the Council, will you push forward with this extremely important proposal.	3.786755211216793
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service.	2.599812040403991
Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under.	3.079186345731929
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue.	1.8116624988253553
We wish to ensure that Article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable, efficient, fair and considerate use of water.	3.5909413240389005
The first is a tendency for the Commission to embark on very ambitious programmes, particularly in third countries, without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing.	2.9444524038708693
We must do this for the sake of the environment.	3.6050420613901584
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	3.122814548439526
It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision.	2.852454890501343
With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy.	2.4247019303415103
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.	1.6603944160639577
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	3.4622623558639627
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop, at Community level, which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities.	3.656890286484473
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency.	1.7752366256034928
Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	2.5467669981825103
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported.	3.1697953619065014
(FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	2.4323372337428344
This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution.	2.7979501776863414
It is far too prescriptive.	3.1166975768941128
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries with northern levels of rainfall.	2.2410306074358624
Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world.	2.7812035650155815
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident, as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too.	2.5414149139572877
As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative' s remarks today were extremely encouraging.	2.79037167659811
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless.	3.3820075212835152
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things.	2.998109236453001
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.367858212651596
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	3.9907448901758693
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	2.6442749129140273
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU.	3.429927965936202
It is also 'confusing' .	11.583751672030761
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard.	4.023664639236089
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	2.9145068854439815
As for a ban on certain materials: of course we need one!	2.220149001397403
Goebbels (PSE).	1.2990373747279276
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies, together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women' s and men' s priorities and needs are better reflected.	2.303607382153286
Lastly, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable.	2.6481406549521767
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation.	2.4066042234327987
We could say that, in this state of affairs, we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and, hence the destruction of the countryside.	3.2521983948718542
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	4.063122668959933
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party, the French Communist mayors, were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France.	2.0264807575522035
Since then, expectations have been high.	2.3393512310000633
Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities.	5.471680823156381
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.	2.841361785319678
Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world.	2.5723430184468663
We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system.	2.836727410252701
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us: in particular Commissioner Liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy.	3.040201737870246
I would like everything to happen much more quickly.	3.8735899830419207
Would you let me have these documents so that I can read them, after I have had them translated? I can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication, which I can only welcome as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, and what is propaganda.	3.158272510795517
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes.	3.4808985857646597
However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me.	2.302351856486524
. Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services.	3.927927386246709
The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition.	2.8954320991469964
It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas.	3.537714114369991
The joint debate is closed.	1.9284972700132044
All those things come together.	1.4822205029473683
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation.	2.8573902750679943
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	3.66267417403876
The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned.	3.2140491434483183
Proposal for a resolution (B5-0125/2000) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the UN Commission on human rights	2.742627552165436
We shall now proceed to the vote.1	1.418756211456684
Finally, we consider that tourism can, in addition to being a growth factor, be a factor for democracy, and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear, conscious commitment.	3.925306661432439
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled.	2.1395422345682538
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa.	4.244198479417113
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible.	2.1666771802841014
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?	2.746723885943532
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO.	2.9177641115499333
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution.	1.920044746488758
One urgent question is therefore raised: why, when this programme has been successfully run for ten years, is LEADER+ still classed as experimental?	2.132209077380801
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements, which we must solve.	3.710517646304582
I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions.	2.8960521004698823
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	3.3000362828566434
In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.	3.246758571378432
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office.	2.4630973960999754
I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity.	2.3420021055023406
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ.	2.605615712135895
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	2.1137624487769084
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	4.9573729696558
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored.	3.959578256655695
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area.	2.3243781644115646
This is worth a compliment although I regret, of course, that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue.	2.3520326985955617
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	2.8050034725946373
We await a proper response from the Russians.	1.9226157759915568
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate.	2.9614537137186288
It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied.	4.668446782637782
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena.	3.3543805991659594
Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries.	2.1685911595723577
Frassoni Report (A5-0021/2000)	1.0820706359717611
Where does all that leave us this year?	1.5817212218621755
But what do these sanctions mean?	1.6138785687485182
It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years.	2.187573677606806
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid.	3.199702048845942
This principle should not only guide the public sector, it should also guide the private sector, especially financial undertakings.	2.845030786251798
It was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects, which are very important for a country like Portugal, which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio-economic development.	2.62991848812863
Agenda	21.75018985665072
What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration?	2.9376276240258403
It must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning, but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as, for example, areas experiencing depopulation.	2.6289934753060646
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises.	2.6368234387834932
Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C, interregional cooperation.	2.7861104731270614
We agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds, this evening' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for Europe, which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor; culture then, and an institutional aspect, the basis for structuring a vast community, a prerequisite for economic growth, and not the complete opposite, as Europe, in its cultural habits, has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past.	2.795377303337486
In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a 'Women and Science' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women' s participation in research activities.	2.563296313919067
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member.	3.422445367912189
Will current programmes continue to be implemented?	4.627184999334831
Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget.	5.284790613663533
We should remember that we, the European Union, are a union of minorities: we are all a minority within Europe.	3.957367199341718
Mr President, the issue of social security systems is an important one.	6.755050629802496
The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide.	3.5348169324470495
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics, which have apparently already broken out, and aid for reconstruction.	2.023035609604341
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	2.1632598516792303
. (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	3.6045508269971274
In addition, employment policy in general is also a factor.	4.849070475002396
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues.	4.411993250136803
Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.	3.099810512424295
I think the statement' s content makes this clear.	3.561590562818234
Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union.	2.715051783242236
This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area.	3.36671910705168
Question No 4 by (H-0028/00):	1.1672026996941478
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.	2.9451656416545777
As you can understand, it would be easy to do so.	3.632438455873236
My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker.	3.8115719511587303
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants.	1.5257716730966473
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission.	3.5022836339712877
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy.	2.3559101557607085
Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union.	2.986855022094924
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides.	1.7023910085522078
As long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few, it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils.	2.6756388578629338
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs.	1.8489851324220745
Report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission recommendation on a Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121(COS))	2.1227679858499147
