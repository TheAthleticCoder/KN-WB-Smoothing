We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	237.34732308856303
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this, then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve.	61.32881489360306
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want.	129.62979553712339
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite!	793.0308451827335
Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament.	70.43208227700359
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments.	429.7147211560208
However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely.	557.8244836014577
I will save a few seconds because I wanted to propose to the Council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Rights and Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.	36.47970778380399
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	475.910430978918
They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	127.0278875224852
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation.	61.54067160023699
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.	3499.125686131551
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	1615.006541425219
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.	160.78046344527587
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure.	263.9102720350381
I think, however, it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken, it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between.	141.07454885046914
I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law.	55.484664052987185
I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety.	79.0931610174896
That is a question of solidarity and progress.	162.38474350305665
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate.	556.3654020081573
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important.	351.4911188805983
Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange.	100.90695249410808
The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require.	169.24798213530076
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured.	298.20903258761757
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law.	228.18333214604334
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks.	220.53603132279602
(Loud applause)	1.1492569002612767
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk.	338.42364499331876
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers.	419.7994434875442
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind.	37.53177822129193
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	65.49626634403442
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva.	255.3767157389485
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed.	537.3258972508343
The Community construction only makes sense if it creates positive discriminations alone, and the UEN Group hopes that this signal to FYROM and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully-paid up part of Europe.	194.6279715359889
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs.	48.800252572514275
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible.	155.17311744344096
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	491.851709978895
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level.	873.9051910654974
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	97.80167333991194
I do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it, which have been working incredibly hard in Kosovo, would regard it as an adequate description of their labours to suggest that they had been standing idly by.	281.84510346611296
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia.	936.7011637402087
We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council.	121.22578466744143
It is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up, one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone.	227.71034704785214
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us.	147.97534828739563
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today.	406.6244783967834
If it is not adopted, Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past.	98.29725958786723
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment.	156.43483143145173
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate.	89.91195090736223
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice...	333.52998283238384
Firstly, we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council.	101.04011759112232
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo.	348.649522720745
What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism?	250.27672584339533
And it is still on the agenda today.	26.58884049596373
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information.	2994.9243146983536
In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak.	298.11629140693253
We need structural reforms in the European economy.	45.891304124969594
Are there any comments?	1.4178596188942216
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.	247.72338644637773
Allow me to say just one word. I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least, once it did, important decisions were taken straight away.	250.36613013848066
In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale.	82.39605629904716
From this vantage point, there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy.	210.32416785458102
Remember that the Council of Ministers, absent again this evening from our debate, approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March.	302.5913609265017
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate.	276.55917949086785
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly.	464.5543380973318
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee.	306.23510368545806
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber.	164.6276014960663
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries?	720.045463422077
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	354.9533660172361
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	1378.2574596452375
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.	382.52332784307896
You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere.	113.09545917453467
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work.	173.6110794529962
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.	203.86715232592752
We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history.	455.5959970269641
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries.	93.23167210126128
First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails.	253.77245457072965
I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate.	51.638158283948044
Why am I stressing this point?	1494.4609577099607
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates.	101.68835042078582
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	504.88807681394366
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	132.74533655209905
. (PT) The Portuguese Presidency is particularly interested in this issue, as I suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament a priority in its programme.	54.41210202701465
But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers.	363.18991159904556
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	152.78226959110344
Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS))	3.169782884017873
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	1260.94191067951
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	688.1803430554797
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy.	68.21711367920433
The Committee supports the Commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that, given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations, the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants.	399.0965688212883
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task.	1079.0134001012289
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity.	300.4463746109373
And finally, in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change, the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance.	180.20061630119528
Moreover, I shall only highlight the most important ones.	388.474294235393
Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe,	130.77752570007956
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC.	56.70302420330862
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	203.87080249318976
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means.	1833.0879916044607
A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases.	363.5841607606301
Nothing could be further from the truth!	1544.0517496073146
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	86.06516082344142
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears.	573.1292903978468
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President.	70.63917182079437
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	63.26718677959995
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups.	1038.1518250449708
The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.	211.91331768744968
However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?	328.9692782740967
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds.	109.06063592346126
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause.	181.92152732388936
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III.	240.17027608377995
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.	63.20080631155298
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special, spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong.	501.68603782773346
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	94.16558454364878
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources.	540.4198583540708
Over the past 25 years, no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop.	42.878516023793885
It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products.	2683.078999053104
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	379.55024875364217
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy.	328.33115456377396
Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective.	20.15547922756624
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty.	26.15436990456449
This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase.	164.9137301611897
In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories.	347.3350729662338
He is a driven man, a competent man.	7410.3178487505475
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	154.04986166158986
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years.	97.86736261965814
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports.	19.49407857612258
This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	407.19756582278444
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view.	1084.0068746420839
In conclusion, I hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once, so that thanks also to the efforts of the Portuguese Presidency, this agenda will be revised.	124.61469881653298
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime.	559.2655743496998
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world.	96.49121354225991
In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case.	57.13023860331763
If you do not, we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you, exactly as we did with the seed directive. I should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise, both for your legal service and ours.	229.0983906794061
And a fully-fledged Europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots, highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known.	783.3802980137442
We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this.	141.44236387478358
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other.	107.86371367377593
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing, we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side.	291.90118747688587
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	126.18131107140813
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity.	161.15353720384041
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.	276.0611006794391
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties.	212.88057255692627
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	699.1544184563626
Most of Parliament' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive.	61.662463686247115
Mr President, this is one of the few occasions when, from what the speakers have said in this Parliament, from all sides of the House, there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta.	30.4371340430482
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is, we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut.	84.7841051533081
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique.	47.31515786251342
In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary.	181.21460339179788
It is also a matter of conviction.	194.96641981799496
I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty.	152.95028358611873
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	403.3397034237149
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.	154.2301852669927
These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing.	276.75609915135954
How can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations, and indeed many others who, in order to make more profit, take the risk of making the world uninhabitable?	504.80219939106803
Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	253.52036044131984
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage.	205.6106881628151
They already existed in ancient times: they had them in Roman times, although on a smaller scale.	768.9672324926321
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU.	130.86056766379608
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities.	408.91669436920455
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European?	277.47258562622267
Forgive me Mr Poos.	537.4874795178496
Last November, the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive.	140.89588246404603
Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions.	225.6392624944123
They urgently need aid such as food, water and shelter in order to survive.	168.02086391490286
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe.	75.9602445438448
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points.	107.44262603940803
We must clearly set firm objectives.	748.2059543942783
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction, together with Parliament.	70.3810631483637
Clearly, what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control, towards systems based on private insurance agencies, which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people, who besides the higher cost, will 'enjoy' even more degraded social provisions.	848.9594844481898
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs.	61.55949507556932
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.	114.42822911134816
So our response must be rapid and strong.	47.50364515994364
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	303.8435346257406
Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based.	150.2880832960943
Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold.	38.454624294947436
As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society.	317.9848565406056
The European Parliament and its Committee on Constitutional Affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the Council decision in Helsinki, so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion, including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the European Union and their financial interests.	143.16686977233982
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	125.16249253312861
Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs.	111.96792949616031
What is the Commission' s verdict on this?	82.09169126711242
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees.	3114.92184444118
But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing.	109.6387943750826
This highlights the need for something which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time, namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type.	119.94727733555777
It is not a lot to ask.	173.7607873966664
We currently believe that this improvement, which we highlighted in the perspectives in November, may lead to even better results than initially forecast.	894.3434885655017
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road.	7.850518808978834
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation.	271.2696825655383
We all took part in it, not just one group.	47.598085784717775
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction.	69.61349492499576
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.	119.74507961281655
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly.	516.4919622395862
On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion.	262.12845774014596
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	186.34352728332598
As far as that is concerned, I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome.	48.41628925482983
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel.	320.32906989314165
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that, in exchange for the Golan Heights, all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt.	338.13067426522315
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	189.62306484670066
I think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage. This did not really happen for the Treaty of Amsterdam or the Treaty of Maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust.	84.2910241131713
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally.	315.715692050601
Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further.	96.90724339551296
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	79.92440008305775
We anticipate, if I understand correctly, a report in September on core activities.	151.15372844463917
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future.	287.28959441116706
By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.	302.16011811384124
Mr President, Commissioner, the Erika sank near my home and is still there, with 20 000 tonnes in its hold, the fate of which we are waiting to discover.	177.7574149769312
In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States.	169.54737726233512
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point.	43.8266677847554
Let me give you three examples.	814.0537185235025
We shall now proceed to the vote.	1.4371500606954688
Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market.	34.2492574841258
It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974.	139.03293916943
Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation?	218.4190433801827
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption?	177.36506452737447
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox.	104.53948691066371
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis.	174.64996758607236
My colleagues' register of interests is complete.	46.66404344581685
Mr Böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee, and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the BSE Committee in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has fallen to him: he is the one with the experience.	92.22212062059688
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as long as nearly thirty years ago, the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy.	57.90301911691278
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration.	502.12175646314563
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal, for example.	97.5043877088988
The Union' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom, security and justice was confirmed at Tampere.	42.12251398600182
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned.	126.87075676749706
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions, as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries.	129.029203107654
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete.	437.3249392287266
Should we not be discussing this issue?	54.3566961734182
As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER.	106.80884256276661
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected.	85.16640921374933
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today, with this debate and this motion, this question is now on the agenda of European construction.	98.22559419869138
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for.	356.1815423470032
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	263.21870295380074
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms.	236.05605255986055
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement.	175.2760633365341
Let the managers manage.	1566.4797493196802
The funding of activities for the implementation, adaptation and development of Community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies, particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development, are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon.	148.01460592396091
In yesterday' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State.	63.31725515928298
Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union.	181.46629473774658
However, it is also a question of political agendas.	45.60061032893812
Firstly, the whole system is obscure.	1247.2025340548723
Mr President, because of the availability of high-technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry, detailed information on their use is needed from the actors, and as we know there are a lot of them, so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe Community law.	100.65194983704001
I wonder, since Mr Da Costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the Chamber, whether Mr Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the view explicitly stated by Mr Da Costa today and in the recent statement by the Presidency on behalf of the heads of government.	203.13833399570555
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	240.61236398379612
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning.	196.6481804012175
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004.	5061.903786394131
I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	177.50852581944767
The principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied.	3.2405862825391125
The European Union must take the initiative and must also, as demanded in the motion, propose this initiative to the G7 because it is primarily a political question.	131.24315154660454
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	21.123212977984092
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services.	197.78359200356374
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is, and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could.	178.23629682026598
Finally, this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission. But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order.	37.34759323164426
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first.	49.8887690630552
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice, even in the appointment of judges.	83.27761189356421
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle.	11.510427238219236
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes, or even 50 grammes.	321.9794449181207
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	71.56972946037256
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves.	60.48856529789021
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament.	107.20614903633533
As long as we have no status, we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union. The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe' s development process.	80.1675700162768
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda.	1263.0103539957938
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which pointed out that, as far as approximating laws is concerned, Article 37 is adequate in this case.	26.472112208843402
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	49.1165870677848
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union.	39.092473836473616
Of course, it is always possible, but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down, the idea of going to Court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in Italy is not very reassuring.	564.9478290966018
However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.	79.67230117829683
Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical.	281.4635712968036
That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method.	158.0612669593944
Can you?	447.4899709028953
We only ask one thing of the Commission: that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories.	277.2044694460923
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	225.1307165532158
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	73.30911621124528
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers, but of society as a whole.	194.44449058238453
What about women?	431.3508533232736
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court, but it does not yet exist.	37.52122701605496
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable.	147.62562442370844
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	45.74207495517336
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments.	165.00185475539558
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights, work on which has just begun.	68.6691167415784
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect.	152.52037485206287
(Parliament gave its assent)	1.8384467724761684
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on.	153.35716165066307
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way.	36.94189914365984
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so.	114.930804620301
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again!	970.6109926652341
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe.	153.08949226030924
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	20.567364879889777
It also means that, when we are fighting these diseases, the problem of destroying whole herds in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or BSE and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda.	200.44737595850296
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years!	347.21520702717135
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	80.98261992188849
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate.	205.12347049409684
In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model.	151.33982766811874
Thank you for your reply.	3.2912687552343085
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).	190.85504351979048
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	303.297151478296
We clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund. We therefore demand, if this motion is adopted tomorrow, that the Commission and Council appear before Parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion.	141.23265668133985
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	259.1176425480838
It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included.	426.50932734277296
There is effective legal precaution.	2400.82718108499
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances, and flexibility in negotiations, that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history.	187.3155216585432
Nonetheless, we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content.	188.86434179914824
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission.	120.32381720558648
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food.	97.10270760254714
I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	27.446811927369737
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	256.4251003979537
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience.	291.9021516648252
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime.	269.2945518386309
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe.	411.17138136522766
-	32.62528478497609
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place.	100.85562577182738
With some 80% of the population of Europe living in an urban area, cities are at the forefront of economic, social and cultural change in Europe.	55.04937577524557
I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	149.08066875790075
Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one.	132.04862957015186
However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set.	197.06946690636929
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project.	242.9255298407858
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power.	408.5589314309031
Commissioner, you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred.	156.43543237625812
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with 'communitisation' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe.	150.04531056578776
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office.	12.715466715590411
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions, whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise.	829.4167805052896
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny.	207.86902352958273
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances.	692.4809651228782
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism.	226.9285772664372
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	53.685242660380965
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase.	614.4472254065553
The Committee on Women' s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education, because according to official figures women account for 53% of those engaged in tourism services, and in parallel, they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change.	338.4993044946915
(FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed.	42.02111291136506
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming.	296.54258815325073
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope, at the end of it, to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House.	40.20488724893294
If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving.	134.1664361256015
The other area of conflict is more difficult.	193.40814915906128
For that reason, in conclusion, I believe we should do something, particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws, not those relating to organised criminal activity, but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena.	161.41647204527357
However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation.	1489.17167195575
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	1155.381073214587
At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used.	272.9527231133376
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	105.85573565386315
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough.	956.5216509240508
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing.	406.31590879702986
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	148.49592412346286
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.	50.69896828420715
This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs.	161.61054576476036
However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used.	341.78582385995173
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	279.09206408628273
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced.	133.94043059409537
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty.	354.49515099890476
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole.	495.7831058480862
Cultural diversity is important, and it is under threat.	30.934215476150314
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still.	225.15507788146527
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations.	139.42524998473488
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	150.81065121253636
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	166.97184843512545
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources.	269.78637577621487
Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies, or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe?	500.24607293681635
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority.	682.1252832852363
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.	406.1990268222942
Romano Prodi promised a revolution.	2949.9281865522285
So far there have been no infringements of the law.	146.37258384719195
The documents will in the main be open working documents.	466.8955654917769
It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner.	374.26230848188897
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union.	189.43373398276896
International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there. I am, to say the least, curious to know how they are getting on.	157.52522116085743
We will be organising and supporting actions including, in particular, the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters.	70.73160495184429
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	446.41128726863985
I think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility, provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds, but may only carry out part of the management per delegation.	510.01473030487284
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this.	147.6669691247113
I hope the House will understand that.	260.8624148660498
I can only quote what is contained in the general Structural Funds Regulation which specifies that the Commission will work with the governments of the Member States. It is therefore the Greek Government which is my primary partner.	121.52042833281169
The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism.	905.1416285073614
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics.	94.95657636261943
On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4.	5.960412258260303
Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe.	82.0603245084851
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts, which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society.	138.79021127257224
The European Parliament and the Union' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia.	596.9603503797763
In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing.	280.40288592147914
So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address.	332.87589477195735
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	93.16127061787927
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	56.78705625453693
I know that we do a great deal of good, but let us start with this very essential aspect.	138.52470390459646
However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature.	454.00608031424014
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.4550725128474453
Europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water, promote its sustainable use, protect eco-systems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances.	90.94320564820397
As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest.	219.54244500227188
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years.	286.71717122402345
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE.	25.322699057559
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system.	177.91211812568326
The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes.	91.84235900135222
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one.	444.8040000048034
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	125.14604354170291
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	284.6001046125304
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	790.2776223547849
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important.	93.24176142566695
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East.	38.46455213397869
Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on.	199.69828413842922
I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects.	78.44559978608882
- (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ.	47.357126939654975
Unfortunately, my Dutch is not as good as yours.	213.79512416685185
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch.	1091.3068866672115
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed.	135.26341431857665
The other issue is access to confidential documents.	478.7118700625606
.	77.3301660757284
We would, at the same time, like to insist on other things.	35.0699093240475
Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment.	227.72112646083926
Future generations of women must not be sidelined.	503.0652374339574
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement.	201.3316417357755
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful.	209.53600087467655
Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid.	95.54500020004356
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	215.70927796034258
Like the rapporteur, I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid.	36.71664309812608
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.2676590784543862
But we see no reason to lower our guard.	806.7202338006141
Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats.	208.7214538913087
The goal for the years to come is to increase women' s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.	130.54202273777474
This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public.	108.68554362039995
At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter.	53.90753150131956
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances.	500.12185099661355
It can only approve Member States' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria: firstly, integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships, whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account; secondly, the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local, regional and national authorities, training institutions, universities, NGOs, the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership, and thirdly, methods and models of indisputably innovative character.	290.0466115416395
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression.	521.12588663681
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning.	153.23025129635573
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	487.96654769074206
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again.	301.51042615253755
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops.	375.74719258928235
As the previous speakers have said, and as you said, Commissioner, in response to my fellow Member, Mr Martinez, with regard to another tragedy, the floods in November in the Southwest of France, you have certainly noted these disasters with concern, but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued, which has resulted in this shocking paradox. This paradox, pointed out by the previous speaker, is that it is easier, a great deal easier, to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the Union than within it.	215.67646950654162
Negotiations will start no later than 2002.	488.7151561718444
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	431.77517336964837
Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	143.54481691947063
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	47.0283042399676
In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states.	763.7730544272854
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated.	1929.7916609932215
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.3111013721872207
If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required.	54.400737862677815
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government.	39.84286521817638
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms.	88.41593631886398
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.	335.092246621462
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	41.147712432342026
Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions.	227.47011277266563
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here.	38.05744708543297
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied.	1006.1467317673732
They have a much wider responsibility.	259.06681405816
I adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the Union are actually active frontiers of the Union, even if, or precisely because, they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear.	262.08938410200955
First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.	21.57388734123585
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems.	253.95191963922622
According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF.	140.5862692599089
Question No 36 by (H-0782/99):	1.2605856117352525
We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity.	119.2668646116944
This is why it is necessary - and Mr Van Hecke has already mentioned this, and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is reassessed.	163.06651319724364
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.	109.06813209049933
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform.	72.33063693994022
The subject in question is of great political and social importance.	47.66058417632033
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	398.11433739068184
During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course.	108.17614991995423
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework.	278.76640272168316
Mr President, the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters.	210.40857107942546
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	592.376378031684
However, the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment.	434.01039167562027
Even in the tourism industry.	99.57155696167945
However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close.	325.5739897192102
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to Europe.	667.293506144078
The Commission guideline document for the new structural fund' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises.	730.17472026434
I am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and vegetables by the EU which is dominating relations between Almería and Morocco. I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions, Member States and European Union which, due to actions or omissions, is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own.	345.66316261948987
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward.	129.88685246318508
The document mentions common values on different occasions.	251.56370926921863
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries.	560.6328878422754
In relation to this, you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces.	250.17974220242544
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks.	205.27861529268546
With global markets, we need global employment laws and global subsidies.	1262.9320346580223
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament, and to members of the Austrian national parliament, and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests, but also of business.	229.24117049291812
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	83.65065516083473
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems.	36.37043944497334
This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy.	325.8386479847639
Unfortunately, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it.	198.2682300372102
But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market.	157.41720422846458
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	394.39442926425056
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines.	722.3931916364464
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period.	1178.5531158006604
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	497.40094109657326
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs.	88.64674488820822
It is up to Washington, not us, to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests.	311.9855107144416
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.	229.8932417289057
In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making.	212.96975098657887
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer.	35.167013954478826
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised.	1156.5632111348318
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle.	1936.0843414776293
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks.	163.9024231831235
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement.	333.39480563522505
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	83.15413092201452
Effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels, thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of European policy in their day-to-day life in real terms.	479.9842506775944
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry.	97.01180575055051
This is unacceptable to my mind.	125.07596812341794
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes.	162.91953409400764
Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy?	48.21157000482375
For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters.	611.1857305961744
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion, but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.	331.37206977370045
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means.	143.99785661605452
Indeed, I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication, published on 13 October last year.	233.69638153727615
At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	95.81367145996182
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty.	189.2012483118444
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules.	90.49407253967766
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million, whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million, a figure which the European Parliament supported.	288.1483723359278
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure.	49.504821742454496
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	292.28618009037126
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines.	132.32345610679457
The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions.	113.16797831526009
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels.	305.675557671777
For me, equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny, alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job.	348.22898000490574
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm.	229.9828769581043
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already, for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm, but also by others - there is a need for more supervision.	27.894102283594112
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.	157.9041922703893
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy.	116.81430090555718
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.	118.09163645919878
Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration.	37.57972140067544
We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires.	153.76102551853688
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	1240.5509439500443
It simplifies things and brings things up to date.	526.014115698262
I also want to take up the subject of migration.	31.350841441643855
Thank you, Mr De Rossa.	14.354089690400183
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.	86.6866217380548
Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief.	40.36071387245267
A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically.	123.8337689705135
It is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from INTERREG III, just like all the other regions in the Union, especially now that the REGIS programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped.	198.22848008229033
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government.	545.12438824524
The implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in European tourism and its industry.	649.0571314595562
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed.	105.48706926616597
Most importantly, we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs.	708.3832923815972
Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together.	63.91731443830887
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water?	106.94943852912407
I thank the President, Mrs Fontaine, who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House.	154.9540592916266
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	1597.3904002545953
There are problems regarding the term "author" .	77.66728653138591
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist.	805.6263848873236
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.	32.05969600840322
In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism.	150.0635998251032
However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya.	40.74282016502396
We do not think so.	7.993318929833875
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed.	264.4287635272595
Mr President, thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail.	23.181181782309157
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	101.71863243731693
This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	381.0909129032408
Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily.	854.2172857479161
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush!	89.99785992755992
Just a few main points.	402.30508702445576
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands.	562.4185965757539
You will understand, Mr President-in-Office, that there was a point to my question, because the Council is a political body of the European Union and the citizens of Europe, men and women, want to know how it views the democratic and social model of Europe in the twenty-first century.	43.85327578258971
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999.	63.88327086937965
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	58.4988688587347
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States.	276.1388149696872
Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough.	1256.8754328209868
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	472.50311201841964
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	189.0141477289434
My first thoughts are for the 26 Indian sailors, who were saved but of whom nothing has been said.	358.21808909407986
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	11.167335102191469
Like the rapporteur, we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA.	62.42858322526421
All the experts can provide information and news, formulate opinions and give advice, but, they have no political or elective responsibility, and rightly so.	277.1040827690479
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	1745.8833802433107
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments.	251.13105339299702
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA.	160.5345980362231
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	62.32185966871216
Subject: Compliance with Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark, even though the deadline has passed.	45.047794444660504
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have, BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved.	440.83311807586983
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	78.65857253252653
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation.	33.848445021637254
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion.	1819.5171602209066
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	43.47489234399195
Madam President, I thought I had three minutes.	62.962907510843415
Declarations of principle are not enough.	50.41852604144254
Mr President, allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo.	16.53999989720769
Remember too, some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years.	496.5427310518278
But I do wonder what his own view is on this.	182.1418101377541
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.	155.545888625667
On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	110.31663986465867
Nevertheless, we must stress that many people are aware, as they were yesterday too, of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political Europe, a risk that was, moreover, indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one' s attention, owing to the authority of the person being interviewed - Jacques Delors.	197.76526394235697
We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position.	84.09461828651764
Despite everything, we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington.	70.03107762285761
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	227.55264544581166
Naturally, this is only to be welcomed.	39.03827605268029
Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward.	159.65936988648903
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	694.2322109264888
The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well.	23.516389812960487
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	615.5019017107896
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.	814.5523003416381
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply.	226.2447702034131
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	301.9017200164455
Report (A5-0021/2000) by Mrs Frassoni, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on procedures for implementing the new Council decision of 28 June 1999 - 'Comitology' (1999/468/EC)	5.7439333052213035
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.	90.8523059581967
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	317.1552025344257
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	28.245104220435014
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé, preferential access is only for "essentially all the products of the least-developed countries" .	336.4771690679445
Despite the fact that the Community, through the structural funds among others, injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe, these disparities continue to exist.	237.44631930187853
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed.	839.1219012329794
We agree with many of the rapporteur' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission' s and the Council' s intentions and plans concerning social protection.	149.1755594907567
Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.	161.2878832598591
I support the enlargement of the European Union.	10.926996222183554
No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament.	74.6911294520189
We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law.	272.58304740458067
As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.	59.091022908007304
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	193.0382101585714
The French State has released funds for compensating damage.	5874.458394251323
It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market.	193.1139765517645
However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well.	321.56925136495624
There are two fundamental questions in particular.	470.9982243795671
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification.	188.74077002459472
I should like to make it quite clear: if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria, the problem in this region will be solved.	110.439261134647
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated.	977.2843974643973
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday.	219.11807149096677
Leopards do not change their spots.	5976.585059021255
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland.	486.92673492667546
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.	107.53929533240192
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region.	464.29671089227344
They will often do fewer home deliveries, charge more for retaining post during the holidays, close down a large number of the post office branches and, ultimately, the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase, at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff.	812.883227858886
There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree.	322.92355638696733
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	138.39084759603466
The words 'issued by' also need to be added after the words 'transferable securities' .	51.30607440696763
The position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the European Union and Turkey and between Greece and Turkey will bear favourably on the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations.	291.8321878003354
This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general.	83.7398419806271
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	103.92625485197902
This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level.	151.70625706602664
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution.	38.718957418271856
I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time.	35.60686650133699
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text.	884.9946825705433
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame.	243.7327366640558
It therefore proved necessary, in the context of establishing the internal market, to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention.	121.68921150240368
I hope and wish, and am indeed certain, that the European Union, with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt, will little by little construct, in the wider area, the necessary environment which it needs itself.	496.3627050596113
Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years.	92.25241631952822
Hurricane "Lothar" should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here -, but to switch to the precautionary principle, under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too.	603.1883769165195
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	30.698168374482336
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	64.38796488041211
First of all, the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic.	304.83245009186606
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.	74.47326879511178
Question No 45 by (H-0006/00):	1.1672026996941478
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	230.5270585996214
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector.	98.13770493194761
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled.	72.87971843509195
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children.	103.60087498296645
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	226.83078087481775
At the end of the day, Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan.	136.85696863976816
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.	25.93766027446842
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13.	269.39693344150453
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs.	77.44742857551581
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important.	398.66638550862723
Therefore, once more, we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision. Codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type, which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application.	391.6059873635445
This is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter-ethnic coordination, and we are all conscious that, if measures are not taken in the short term, we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago, and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of Kosovo.	266.7407532160517
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.	130.14077418085276
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	88.07432807244669
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community' s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.	37.33454278236751
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks.	316.26852345985395
Will you confirm what is the case?	56.06261700529395
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority.	439.43287693305865
Mr President, two centuries ago, during the French Revolution, a very famous woman, Olympe de Gouges, was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women.	561.1905729632574
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	102.02768548129362
During the new programme period, in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations, such as ISPA and Sapard, it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of INTERREG with other financial aid to third countries.	213.76440746318997
It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof.	44.43601059305704
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker.	29.933990010684074
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments.	235.2957205353394
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future.	286.8158144631465
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse.	410.9668729860247
So this issue will be addressed.	24.97304920791865
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain.	539.6865350131196
There are huge reserves; certain zones, rural zones, so-called zones lagging behind but which still have unspoilt nature and untouched natural habitats, are listed as having good potential for what we call eco-tourism or green tourism.	1388.3142466556499
I refer to Eurodac.	619.239668850848
Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today.	194.43665575406223
We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under.	266.4326998507627
As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	192.96645701313145
The filtration camps are camps in which torture, rape and violations are perpetrated: we know that now.	1328.890867937346
There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy.	428.09697296593566
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment, as well as the transfer of territories.	130.4516087404013
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.	341.22470561419505
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	9.452278859232205
We really hope and believe so.	307.2206141776743
I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately.	268.57261154092714
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist!	385.11774727409534
. (DA) The Left' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that, with today' s decision, Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers' diplomatic sanctions against Austria.	82.62566113533944
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million.	437.26888701158566
The debate is closed.	1.074867157108095
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge, as well as the BSE crisis.	326.0757698572798
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable.	7334.873438970317
Mr President, this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life.	271.86063791089305
Nowadays, it is becoming more commonplace, as well as efficient, to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes.	1094.1965938247445
It is thus not confined to EC activities.	802.8778346371412
Because they have a different level of education.	153.80699797878566
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence, so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities. It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them.	133.18049012983235
The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies.	711.7284594445083
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	373.4240262007743
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting.	634.4377611320751
However, the aid needed now is difficult to get through, despite the efforts of the NGOs, because the roads, bridges and railway lines are damaged.	770.3258957152824
This too is a particular desire of my group.	187.16326954328383
And let me say in passing, it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to.	82.07626462181011
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	237.67910758401635
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members.	567.0853743715003
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way.	86.54275409829616
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds.	350.7548970122246
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels.	2762.262531096037
I want to emphasise, however, that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can only be fully effective if Parliament and the Council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the Commission.	149.6216675424726
What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.	275.0476185845317
This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection.	379.6734272664876
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention.	190.67441823560952
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	1277.6308060401896
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important.	66.95075167755134
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if, once they are at sea, most vessels do just what they wish?	1674.777580471085
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question.	334.2119414450898
Otherwise, the challenge really would be lost, not just for the present but also for many years to come.	91.22210974336778
Question No 54 by (H-0117/00):	1.1672026996941478
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	391.17847056832625
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	747.3304640799086
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject.	86.30841359820097
Apparently, according to my information, the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work.	265.25094302003464
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.	163.4965531132173
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament.	111.30986291155335
Regarding the situation in Carinthia, we need to look at this in detail.	72.66580234195919
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	119.06677889652578
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	266.0710713663036
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom.	282.4961670373429
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion.	423.8520904003465
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court.	41.40003522836299
I do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which, today, can only be removed at local authority expense, i.e. the taxpayers' expense.	234.8650195036516
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches.	548.1319013778598
I do not think that we can accept their procedures.	62.79697688957777
Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon.	168.90797632273362
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness.	1871.595294304285
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	104.75894059130145
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care, water and sanitation.	263.55256434391873
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention.	219.85934294426832
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed?	1692.0034397448082
Mr President, when the Doñana disaster occurred, the non-governmental organisation, the World Wide Fund for Nature, gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe.	355.49173684330054
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	71.51618131262653
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government?	139.30790380790233
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda.	373.86250658657514
This is a political question which, in the short term, requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament.	70.04502835287688
Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF.	276.42161168193905
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision.	91.12099558048129
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques' .	544.6696797472898
Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community.	91.36359351765637
They will take a long time, as we are finding out.	76.64394462607463
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon.	528.4341857410143
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.	42.094931643755636
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.	27.49883509111966
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	3.2853859989082483
It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject.	59.011193503490965
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	181.96961577621656
This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations.	59.684294747106726
This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment.	328.17439154548634
At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat.	99.63747846380343
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	205.9739930578374
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	439.89111034550365
It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia.	168.89675408348515
It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well.	568.6379843462404
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament.	134.61779523950955
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	335.5485398938492
At last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment, the source of so much despair, if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the European structural funds.	165.6861912406814
.	77.3301660757284
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars.	974.9924815604867
It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots.	57.45631882877265
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	122.90900551396123
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative.	23.503885861113396
We still await the first report, and that is why I believe this debate was premature, as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning.	121.8693693700858
- (DE) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU.	106.53382629986345
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that.	108.25554417176114
In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market.	311.10196019593366
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly.	56.60757055883139
Mr President, first of all, I would like thank the rapporteur of the EQUAL report, Mrs Stenzel, very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us.	69.09210080674573
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	54.97053589035095
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states.	345.6661693628509
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention.	128.39203320198257
But it is time for the legislation to be updated.	126.5050730825115
For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.	92.146036640502
What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies.	60.02552170189603
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women?	313.67786775891045
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings.	526.3160894907159
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added.	299.2068826846977
This is unacceptable in my view.	6.253044999268606
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	134.02386998139545
It is we, our own people, who keep the war going over there.	402.25742039562914
At this stage in the discussion, please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me. I would ask that we be judged on our results, when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future.	82.63854858389011
Flags of convenience are one problem, but are not the only one.	137.93881057288766
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses.	636.629985158528
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.	199.271655308933
This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	166.2316715839532
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences.	153.50438063223518
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions.	258.20143966759673
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections.	21.895120244101932
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so: I myself share these concerns.	463.410224036204
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	354.2089694939829
As this is the first Valentine' s Day of the new millennium I hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this House to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease, the biggest killer in the European Union.	92.6777291425759
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000.	141.7797148576305
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	197.728522649039
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole.	44.068227144192335
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed.	203.94766149382085
(FR) Mr President, we have already had the opportunity, at the first reading, to examine this report and I was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this House.	48.209045401177434
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday, we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism.	166.60746837465786
If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	246.5241026976291
In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law.	100.29479210978336
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this.	125.36581528797674
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.	74.26637171293142
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today, but to continue on our present course, advocating sustainable development.	566.1208956303672
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand.	142.64705815414712
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	372.0279124316251
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention.	160.34571304844232
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty.	26.553312362865523
For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	413.41566078133826
It is clear that is not acceptable.	34.871651801885044
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant.	26.875502036145484
I would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators, but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment, or to put it another way, projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs.	159.5397090709355
That is to say, if this Parliament commissions a Committee of Experts - and I am not going to repeat what Mr Casaca has said, but I agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem, where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on, ad infinitum.	73.70652641850498
We have before us Malta and Cyprus, which are two States keen to become members.	188.28478397929888
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU.	455.3697852943062
For a long time, probably a survival of our colonial heritage, our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland, ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours.	1017.3730193999997
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances.	186.28030931506908
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology.	261.42037346452116
The Commission does not have enough staff.	89.59397839708079
I am very concerned about these translation problems which, unfortunately, we seem to be having increasingly, and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed.	91.32724000608437
Firstly the agreement on political issues.	593.8685467909689
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved.	24.1384193163774
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	108.78229341593617
Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals.	970.294706744252
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	309.1473694451426
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated.	745.0912922451831
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation.	177.93368114930058
In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid.	177.64342256080934
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	84.34419702273647
I ask Mr Nielson, in his summing-up, to directly address those points in the resolution.	277.1814142817326
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	201.72436807965002
This indicates that we have a broad consensus.	49.04062672102811
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind.	82.12581181424682
The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers.	68.07715323308679
In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS.	106.80353800810117
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes.	43.75052881367487
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world.	128.64091418861705
Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed.	32.30857271441282
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped, in line with the Commission' s proposal.	75.2702622564409
It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament.	71.61033558845072
I would be in favour of its doing so.	41.93906294179672
This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out.	900.5802350513922
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	19.634367159791196
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	187.12446630964925
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.	61.49611581413815
This calls into question the agreement which Parliament reached, with great difficulty, with the Council in December, according to which, when the Commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction, the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary.	120.9050825046108
(Applause)	1.3351614534010348
It was, in fact, in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there.	362.21211189058465
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable.	1904.7705721654245
One can only hope that it succeeds.	328.24719209047976
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment.	149.45867495246185
Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid.	81.84549460662609
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital?	20.512603951350375
Indeed, it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources.	275.79067888871884
In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.	317.62211467676195
However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative.	124.30529328505409
I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here.	69.56920979991814
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction.	190.56227549472246
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future.	47.066630685426546
So how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed, impoverished and marginalised people, the 'working poor' of part-time employment, and working conditions that are dissociated from the policies implemented?	137.5404873010163
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure.	1618.6330483873892
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important.	69.55509964892778
My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters.	517.2477416867172
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	64.08619095161863
These splendid cars do not constitute waste.	653.7977670391201
I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority.	17.33443879593346
We cannot afford to wait.	12.845421200249259
Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship.	117.49014792546176
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	72.88448158213734
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks.	652.3293718417638
The water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being drilled by a mining company, and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened.	105.14276206552279
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.	334.8019242231014
We have seen vote after vote lost.	10313.788925401059
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	340.8367661131055
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal.	336.4291929129289
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves.	134.80668081888354
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it.	223.63192366206158
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	919.7626130471892
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible.	19.66431595343882
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	160.1379255629462
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	47.21069272901062
In this way, at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition, which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations, a shot in the arm.	147.10621695988618
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme.	917.2470422975146
At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda.	112.00192098508208
Mr President, from this year until the year 2006 around EUR 200 billion is available for the Structural Funds, but only 5¾ % is set aside for the Community initiatives, INTERREG, LEADER, URBAN and EQUAL.	145.12514726458377
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development.	638.610721368703
In fact, it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re-use and manufacturer' s liability.	138.21534012835818
With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another.	684.4082483573538
While, on the one hand, we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary, we would on the other hand urge the Commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved.	221.85403745108053
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole.	147.53170659992963
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial, because otherwise there can be no development. It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique' s debts.	308.01237598513484
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection.	268.1853276015816
Today, it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it.	192.32323282527545
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	333.26687683640495
In my opinion, the Commission and Mr Kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management, but each Commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general, empty proposals.	324.614280251838
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions, but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary.	93.2358334813097
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination, the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution. This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.	120.45418075672923
You can see it in different countries.	100.1786429669939
We need a directive in this area, and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure.	122.84477580227275
Subject: Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations (Art. 4.2).	939.5163036303322
Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on.	226.35412518029668
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents.	98.53830748419459
Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary.	44.63011470998349
Happy Valentine' s Day!	395.28770222330826
I share some of the concerns expressed here, especially by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, but this face-lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index, and which are therefore managed either passively or not at all, and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively-managed fund were treated in the same way, if only to allow medium-sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market.	286.1369694437323
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected President is imprisoned, parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered?	331.7125552367101
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists, thus creating an entire productive system.	219.99383815252858
Maritime transport, industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing.	1336.770815501181
If this is not to be a mere media event, it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee, the composition of which the Portuguese Presidency has already proposed.	98.46215443542036
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation.	42.39037249820341
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile, it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry.	360.5765774035555
In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe.	35.079645563496044
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty.	107.8696173534544
Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention.	129.84529384988127
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.	92.28434339165082
In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious.	209.8347022229603
I express the hope that - in fact, I urge the present Commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the Commission. Otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value.	150.60688985597994
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	151.97651253462928
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	978.2507759838205
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	67.48563318097652
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable, not just to this House, but more generally to the European public.	103.49131680666572
As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation.	212.93182322279455
Straight away I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees, from all the committees, but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives.	77.99377132464384
In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon.	157.85191658975288
Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.	225.1192710283225
Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources.	656.6437922424811
We are also committed to the Security Council' s sanctions against UNITA, including arms controls.	1176.435576179818
Mr President, since 1996, the discharge has acquired a heavy, political significance.	543.0323824082194
That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	60.72233974131841
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share and I shall not, therefore, repeat any of his ideas.	89.46479584769386
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall.	3972.2260193067355
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	81.04780595521476
But when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category, an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable sampling in abattoirs using such tests can provide useful pointers in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and, basically, where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis.	389.3538139074439
However, we have to work within the existing legislative framework.	86.62709450773842
It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas.	220.69330844158648
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product.	145.11370434886152
Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.	306.69524086235174
Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy.	275.28959340167904
The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes.	407.83720081303164
Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	635.619592111648
Therefore, any modernisation process has to take account of economic, employment and social protection differences between the various countries, whether Member States or candidate countries.	95.12976149246683
Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place.	256.2449345603564
We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.	327.090619194959
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past.	358.6130512370575
That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies.	169.38643412988117
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy.	157.77965713897302
What about the infrastructures?	28092.57484465541
Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	582.2027338801782
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.	450.9236262774276
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners	3999.6240378493935
I now come to the EQUAL initiative, which is, of course, based on Article 13.	19.012199792724083
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes.	98.1573499281263
These aspects are very much interconnected.	70.35397374810987
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	123.42245281357901
Mr President, this agreement deals with a sensitive issue: cooperation in the field of criminal law.	38.343008740936725
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	76.9624540582559
Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance.	26.10251174397019
This method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the "dead" car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process.	544.9912070244186
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.	133.1931129400587
Question No 9 by (H-0798/99):	1.2605856117352525
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately.	293.98388085991235
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets.	276.04126785510266
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	167.0291384455952
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	36.45813475932749
My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case?	428.1862065287941
Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to.	73.95707761766224
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.	235.46931318047194
After a month, however, there was still only a handful of observers.	125.97679622444711
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation.	284.323502193311
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities.	255.51771182457637
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time.	1714.1971698563996
It is critical to note that the Commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the Court of Auditors.	57.053156314398294
Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda.	74.10296861618636
That is important.	5.932996460098662
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	190.74729933016258
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project.	64.07257734219085
The Commission' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence.	364.0028082236152
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	173.55152989593725
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola.	58.12243656187106
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50.	145.58936177633439
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	27.08892138550771
Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known.	27.044235153775652
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	378.8673913468597
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary.	466.70516606568486
We are now unable to guide the peace.	495.857387923725
In fact, the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted.	927.4560787524481
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs.	80.53308019232566
And therein lies the paradox.	698.3470144883315
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements.	301.7358078729993
That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked.	267.159441755561
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.	24.915115431011017
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	228.20393743530312
I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important.	137.64010248035638
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	123.726335957228
After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC.	162.47667479577223
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	202.28245719225768
B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists,	7.188991436113469
He has convinced me of that.	146.42956338816757
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here.	119.92618842113056
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative' s policy unit.	272.01437428917956
