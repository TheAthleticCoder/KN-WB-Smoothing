This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully.	169.24702688571355
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	48.85792952773988
Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million.	113.75216311498023
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	143.78821646311818
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments.	65.87230846966808
Mr President, Commissioner, my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive.	17.370793530763503
However, at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made, like OSPAR, but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs.	92.1245692994663
In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified.	81.82010875481535
The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised.	33.00760284932025
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it, namely when I was on a visit to Africa.	287.933679769447
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.	183.04243758630398
We do not play at political correctness in this House: we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time, and which the European Commission has also followed carefully, attentively and pragmatically.	68.77824308982868
Mr President, for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee.	100.33564439187131
Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament.	36.663536628704954
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there.	108.73821678793901
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	18.726128144456347
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates.	49.43863827176284
This is why the National Front voted against the report.	70.12669284382893
The report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed.	108.92001759726352
Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission.	65.43454432288522
No.	51.34530817402678
But we have to grasp the tools to do that.	95.6025187687854
(Parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution)	3.150484517010219
Assessment and publication are part of this, and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past.	46.34500511389735
President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper.	19.098297010638742
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security.	61.98292600722297
I say: shame on them!	492.4949173772385
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes.	133.75439799892027
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments.	134.56070141831393
First of all, the immunity of officials: this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor.	72.58171740619497
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.	5.2451313680472555
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union.	53.93833287762861
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong.	452.81551774525883
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0027/2000) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Lienemann).	7.432108857440983
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.	22.351846058927283
Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term.	93.57241522962202
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled?	149.2095200720411
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection.	86.97730309861839
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future.	38.08145328423915
Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture.	72.57667295436416
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective, for example, by type of fish stock.	132.64996951897575
When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals.	80.64836978707197
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes.	48.59780234835276
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	155.6996246378202
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles.	109.65621951011738
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson.	442.35740813536
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	235.93609706013697
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay, and where they are to pay tax.	144.37059560458172
First of all, regarding the remarks of Mr Crowley, who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure ISD approach; the objections of the Commission to that proposal would be the following: such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non-consistent sets of rules; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest.	207.19314718615144
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier.	29.482198847561946
This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century.	85.11976101191225
Will it be omitted?	1485.8910861841248
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks.	38.93910984108251
Another example is cacao.	469.21506674516996
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity, also from within this Community.	87.43411785097068
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy.	58.56255542789841
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect.	57.69366859166355
But I have a quite different question for the Council.	56.613273927316094
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market?	57.40573738685885
Recourse to the precautionary principle	4.420149008953952
This is the only opportunity that we have to see to it that the interests of economists converge with those of people who want to earn money and have their mind set on dollars, like Disney' s Scrooge McDuck, who has dollar signs for eyes, except in this case the symbol is that of the euro.	84.22377994835792
Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship.	76.55575912019164
Will they also take part in our defence policy?	173.1021069858382
Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD))	3.386315629998572
This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive.	57.26388328400921
Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence.	62.089478451927086
But, secondly, the projects will put a strain on, indeed will be injurious to, the national democracies.	80.14470385081285
In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level.	80.0954837568178
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself.	92.05846931740271
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full, and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports, to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants, and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection.	169.49611933375098
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.	67.28695070512188
Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe.	65.81384552664926
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	125.67122925972909
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past.	74.03158319940299
SAVE	11.930261968829681
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters.	182.96727727377055
Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation.	77.92406637136258
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament.	77.60821184393082
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes, although this should be self-evident.	43.32084520668792
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life.	97.34606213217555
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally?	114.01685140687637
It naturally has to support these negotiations, sponsored by the United States; contacts have to be increased; the presence of the European Union envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency, within the powers of the European Union, is positive.	70.29098061330096
I am aware of the Member' s competence on these matters.	45.38024235548021
Yet, through LEADER, there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy.	64.93673379433987
It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework.	107.17987939226124
Mr President, the majority of the borders, which have divided Europe for centuries, were artificially created, separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.	135.56759277356363
That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper.	50.726179289732286
In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop.	184.49943982278072
Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it.	11.683706301717951
VOTE	11.930261968829681
The first is concerned with conflict resolution.	154.71436023581902
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union.	57.827842946951215
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	75.86758998030493
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution.	81.99830180634716
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated.	25.953797280219366
The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	228.4220069667691
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands.	41.653192821123575
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas.	16.22269409563709
In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	20.492002865002565
. (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling.	29.716982538015284
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives.	19.780798613925132
First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?	41.75163895382345
Thank you, Mrs Kinnock.	112.550624505843
In the territory of Member States of the European Union, applicant countries or Member States of EFTA, there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives.	55.732523929200035
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters.	201.68557734626816
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE	8.391932925751735
In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	68.34215331418751
Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments.	20.067787017298066
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick, which is a major ecological disaster, practically unprecedented in scale.	77.60627317345742
The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	87.04037784429767
An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.	130.26056360395054
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress.	56.86398270325187
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy.	85.33659948008177
From the data which I am referring to today, it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact.	88.26295032743663
Having listened to the Commissioner just now, we know that the Commission' s knowledge of the facts will result in a 'no' to the Tobin tax.	23.37131732210811
These are real problems, but they have all been dealt with.	39.01704737171022
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency.	535.411988725496
With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	177.3986826297326
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally.	118.19089578812597
In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244.	242.7582724662706
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	32.57822406294896
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria, but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue.	33.591367588567806
There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development.	93.80052362741795
This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down.	187.64960281647856
Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react.	64.06681093326515
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here.	28.155669702919276
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work.	160.3769333702398
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5.	49.37069999220488
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.	103.42244322885664
In this respect, Mr Bolkestein, the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax.	19.629962840839568
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States.	65.25260946078802
, rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report.	38.41282942172723
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and, therefore, reliable as a partner in peace?	211.20289005368656
This is not just a technical situation, it is a political situation, and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation, because there are aspects to this, and we may as well be open about this, which are associated with the international community' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo, with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region.	91.83539620449474
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy.	18.123547988829355
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission.	36.099277235720905
This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market.	123.50383007459803
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening.	297.224235927335
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner.	15.92380747724847
However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible.	116.34472137217566
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision.	381.0775166578205
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question.	57.705349220300505
There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	74.55577450071398
Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty.	57.14799647624067
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency.	99.01693645498135
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed.	257.277825711206
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals.	110.29373717804663
On another level, we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting.	120.09136190225922
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.	225.54180534633755
I agree completely.	5.680925522646589
. Mr President, industrial change, which can be gradual or sudden, is driven by new technologies, worldwide competition or consumer preferences.	127.85578938895445
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	139.83123750808406
Firstly, this is welcome because it explains, to our fellow citizens, what we are intending to do and what we are already doing. We must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future.	66.3175502788023
Europe is a community of law.	81.78022900327677
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy, for the first time, concerning such a difficult regulation?	71.88971137938746
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	81.15822968735647
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	158.3764028620686
So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.	51.02697772271419
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.	1.3960807339491381
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource.	519.7033500623648
But, and I would like to stress this, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment, marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-European, nationalistic actions and reactions.	104.16484431573555
Unfortunately, we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future.	63.394300190079846
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture.	134.99172891687422
The European Union, for its part, will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement.	45.97440575942334
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	50.76075761244353
Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon.	75.54659818601263
Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence.	55.80440925154843
Mrs Gillig, but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope, voiced concerns about employment.	106.35722410943424
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe.	60.45667407649509
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain, it should be at national, regional and local level.	41.135847101889006
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability.	7.276997342457899
That is where we really get into difficulty.	287.27931170154073
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	52.822401191580845
Mr President, I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies.	65.73160672541474
Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles.	140.45967301408314
Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings.	103.57424746140428
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened.	35.65059168259902
As I live in the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud region of Belgium, I am well aware that the regions are where Europe is being created. They are where we live the European experience on a daily basis and where the people make European construction come alive.	91.35135447012323
The report states that in Greece and Italy targets for improving ?employability? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with.	124.63156415359668
Then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family, the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens' rights are only respected within sovereign states.	112.47637173266598
In the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal accusation against Mr Javier Solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the European Union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter.	92.24464893908706
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.	151.2268868552773
But it is also a very vulnerable sector, as we recently saw with the oil slick.	74.26060076092972
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster.	153.2223812611587
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe.	75.46051133811352
What could be the cause of this?	48.20888206532664
This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage.	66.42129654628124
Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders.	150.47338943214703
And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side.	149.98667514705738
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today.	129.49922085844187
On a more general note, it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries.	56.34368609968053
Mr President, I would like to try to put a different perspective to this.	39.95917488366802
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers.	112.01099024937619
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue.	131.98303629837088
Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories.	45.43837467669304
In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making.	100.57312774590302
However, Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted, and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years, and therefore to change the situation.	105.7794240516458
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report.	318.4292431060326
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	54.081139847891535
Mr President, I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account.	23.16506417341404
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.	116.43680927866713
Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow.	36.092024144181686
However, if your response was to be that we should turn to "Mr CFSP" , that is, to Mr Solana, then I fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter.	66.23256467298464
- (PT) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve, I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately.	150.852944733611
The rhetoric that we use, however, often smacks of smugness, verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America.	119.75858411708231
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind.	109.78072141003159
We shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing Albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region' s multi-ethnic nature.	104.27782568645866
This must be brought forward.	60.900662877595074
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	3.6262594358550366
We are of the opinion that the Member States' budget policy should be strictly supervised, to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times.	55.53001823276714
To them I just want to say, as the English expression goes, 'You can' t have it all.'	66.08551382590986
Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable.	41.95564626357556
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister, the President-in-Office of the Council, to put a stop to this scandal at once.	26.778234323384826
There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found.	144.03598288340928
Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society.	120.83948806500356
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles (8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	3.9645650860087547
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	177.47790396069536
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity.	140.88558649148993
I know that action is being taken against this so-called tourism elsewhere, but we must remember the European Union' s responsibility at this level.	92.72143382908645
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time.	145.4109387052442
Establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable, even though Article 4(c), of the ECSC Treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry.	79.26857631828295
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?'	77.44574337839386
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy.	205.45530441781958
How would you describe this?	491.16987294356153
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper.	103.3146237963483
Just you go home and say: " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date" .	172.78254706646047
Question No 39 by (H-0807/99):	1.2109168246814805
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious.	52.869953061278494
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.	115.29388610148331
The regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries, including your own, must act as an example to others. These illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords, an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation, rendering them modern-day slaves.	136.41819569868125
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals.	103.6831829813693
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.	1.6359733451032863
As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners.	119.10578809777874
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated.	68.97730231546561
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament.	61.64400338913675
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice.	97.58782293189992
Mr President, Commissioner, permit me, first of all, to make reference to two facts.	42.623429936079255
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy.	202.2406411635838
Two questions if I may.	33.91433664744713
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.	67.9061074733807
Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.	72.04447401386138
I look forward to the next round.	25.8138511702513
That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role.	74.68936913566894
Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005	5.462760090802266
There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern.	71.80144847587671
I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system.	122.61555650594079
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.	67.4997124562786
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	83.10567670240054
Retrospective law is bad law, it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law.	185.651158642821
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	23.412036015762336
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect, perhaps more so than most people, both Europeans and non-Europeans, would believe.	94.51226255087083
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here.	89.72768382108518
The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market.	75.9462977522785
Mr President, last week, in the Andalusian town of El Ejido, we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000.	83.04993167830078
For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener.	179.17196812487205
In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.	76.428352024454
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration, with particular reference to the rights of women and children.	87.9770067613669
The promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition. The latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health, education, transport, communications, water and whatever else.	119.57075614733712
The tax has the support of 47% of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want.	85.98230274015539
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards, we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters: rust buckets badly crewed'.	132.4361093557445
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness.	225.71826030100965
However, I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO, among others, are often of inferior quality.	171.5948213956161
We will be looking for the detail year by year, for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year.	64.55720321439625
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	55.89591895304972
I can think of many mountain regions which are continually spoilt in order to develop a tourist sector.	121.97146183381683
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.	88.15087050591887
In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order.	57.273573285515226
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness.	166.3250488807386
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	50.33264764713582
The news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue: we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and troubled than the dark scenes depicted by Orwell.	117.24597086839808
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson' s comments to this House last month. "The Commission's internal control" he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation.	129.32253134377785
What is more, the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control.	104.33898584088438
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.	66.52657379291145
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December.	40.721417904440514
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union.	160.55894686927755
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence.	67.34089659147733
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day.	277.44737734282074
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed.	108.18628631835124
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	65.3383603561938
In addition, quantitative criteria (risk exposure) should be introduced.	255.33498883482022
During debates in committee, we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as MEDA, TACIS or PHARE.	164.00114615117408
These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it.	41.111806000671756
However, some people in our political group think otherwise.	278.7924842844875
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	65.04408242245827
The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime.	150.50246369282073
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	61.57733530309257
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present.	41.37164453191041
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it.	102.96854112059961
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	86.05574901142383
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure.	73.89753842381249
Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.	58.27346677258967
Last but not least, we need a long memory, for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future.	46.11695966323875
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	80.72047971289538
(NL) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement.	91.70315867483644
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform.	142.47354287023126
On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development.	55.967189567207164
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage.	178.50388114738885
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.	10.584051136370192
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and, therefore, I hope to see him there soon.	137.54428456210454
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision.	145.54080010459117
Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me.	113.92220073099367
As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	70.21259434824852
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand: anything is open for discussion, as long as the budget stays fixed.	139.69875124296516
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	146.08184884423048
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	31.43832186900233
We should be careful about this.	46.23648164215825
Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants.	57.95025204062008
Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council.	51.836634557492715
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.	162.08112980971404
The Commission would have abolished URBAN, but this time Parliament drew the longer straw.	204.13597169024771
Let me illustrate this with a topical example.	154.95510983815925
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	21.709933494659552
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States.	64.89480513078476
So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point.	55.658768877351974
Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new?	164.06180801381467
Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease.	48.172687175061846
I would urge Members to sign up to the commitment made today at the Winning Hearts Conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.	114.50771525806086
Whatever system is adopted, ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer.	53.60790696707246
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China.	27.359179265583904
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded.	73.4575710409652
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	59.64327939251914
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees.	67.10036585733872
Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management.	154.19025110334223
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.	53.91640018367979
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality.	191.3113482606425
These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States.	62.371847146078416
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply.	153.1584471988849
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.	166.9413818230501
In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State.	133.56854725107368
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper.	56.30783908471115
They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.	434.8729407448342
Finally, our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back, not to both branches of the legislative authority, but to the Council alone, which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure.	134.3629362527161
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label.	53.13493534302244
Action must get under way immediately.	84.923158213785
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got, at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes!	102.3754768344576
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security, and for flexibilising social protection itself.	118.43829363012527
On the contrary, as many in this House understand, I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability.	143.6756711297645
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider' s electoral success.	124.73992096496615
We must give them this opportunity.	169.22332512416344
We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication.	31.247780026725987
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions, such as education and health care.	114.30721718632496
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	282.86034187043026
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	133.3270949609046
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting.	50.370963658139935
That is usually the case.	34.14829808570411
All laudable stuff.	14.040473464219817
In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt.	71.63798921093944
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty, some of them very old, which are still referred to as EC.	46.25164868926499
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation, which is something to be welcomed.	28.56197588363597
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives.	73.28630969285066
(Applause)	1.2465554171384723
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	114.93270076340099
Brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people, the regions and the Member States. The only decisions which should remain with Brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively.	107.77762272892872
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated.	122.54912094167653
He has done a great deal of work on behalf of Parliament in producing a wide-ranging consensus on what is, by any definition, a thorny issue, not just in this Parliament but in virtually every Member State.	56.97772765390921
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable.	304.10324244326796
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	140.768911615125
In recent years, the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people.	180.63391388380765
I now come to the content of the report.	5.682762271584287
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	136.5925508178617
What establishes a recognised minority?	66.6084097013184
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.	61.085273396978536
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present.	149.370041050319
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations, not a vast sum in the Community budget, and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus.	59.24684491954051
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve.	33.747440382901715
On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	11.720976620903778
I therefore believe that a European civil protection force, real civil relief blue helmets, who would go to areas in difficulty within the Union, as we currently have no emergency procedure, but also outside the Union if needs be, in Venezuela or anywhere else, is something that we should hope to see. I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit.	116.63617150633337
Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally' s report.	89.39640148132038
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	111.46689503173685
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	261.0492941881039
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique.	45.73653867632552
Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born.	117.34989008079133
As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	102.61880426616084
For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account.	74.90878515178882
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question.	170.88675322796888
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around?	141.60143417725052
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	205.95758687980467
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny.	85.076404586939
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all.	75.38189824577928
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement.	8.107495040110194
The next item is the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the "statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues, 13-14 March in Bergen" (COM(1999) 270 - C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).	11.883623288977855
Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before.	47.42587387646475
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union, surely it should receive priority consideration.	195.32339349404484
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio.	99.75839076323095
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars.	118.12462581343547
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions.	120.60951217654564
All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	47.80618289437036
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President' s cabinet.	214.24212644188944
I am opposed to this, unlike the majority of this House and indeed the majority of my own group, because I believe that, in competition policy terms, the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met, and I believe there is a threat of renationalisation.	68.01058089486749
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment.	65.43586393185554
The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities.	78.37682942620614
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further.	92.41555300864366
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear.	323.5175516387803
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe.	209.68986335402616
First of all, Mr President, can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response.	39.10878318808938
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water.	30.486620699725957
In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission.	71.76084124610217
So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home.	176.62304895431865
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.	40.27718693137106
A government must have more nerve and more courage.	95.16071765090167
Bankruptcy procedures	44.927144652273434
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness.	130.28898183278193
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields.	44.92394598078173
This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many.	144.11848411562988
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence.	241.94467074110864
I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations.	152.41812710336208
Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view.	46.18351849139375
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance.	105.39882476216373
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing.	41.194341864128326
For Greece, for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria, but also for Europe as a whole, the social and economic restoration of the Balkans, bringing political stability, is a vitally important matter.	74.1143634923288
It is not the European Parliament' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the European Union' s 15 Member States are to remain in place and which are to be shut down; to expand their work forces or reduce them; stay in the same location or else move; be sold or not be sold; and, in the case of those which are to be sold, to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside Europe.	81.56604705400301
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive.	61.937095511352354
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems.	205.20473697523227
When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household.	44.493517347307424
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference.	58.05600873835534
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	228.43934152779119
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area.	26.11333273781764
Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public.	20.19287526626516
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly.	165.01358611956513
And this is not pure chance.	386.27800501969494
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system.	249.80294178166287
We do not, in principle, oppose this industry.	83.5538240329303
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107.	13.574447788439175
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget.	52.72293310295185
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	61.26137695851028
I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7.	38.29431529272956
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.	211.884385292558
Storms in Europe	295.25081279521436
This, however, does not seem feasible.	33.41648628262769
More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity.	508.0152681762775
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control.	47.79196242253395
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary.	81.32672404722398
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	120.08819399674302
Mr President, I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem.	252.5518588344468
50% or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest.	346.00446808398044
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to.	45.423353272907185
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it.	25.7529188724652
At the same time, however, it means that both the Council and the Commission have a very strong mandate, so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the European parties, and all the peoples, can empower their political ability to address the problem.	60.660430128396484
With regard to your suggestion for increasing the Court' s resources, the Council considers that all of the Union' s institutions have, under the Community budget, the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective remits.	61.9391946000964
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real, visible area of training and culture.	100.03291227011907
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication.	112.109596855433
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive.	52.10210693523078
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	58.82313430414957
Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now.	63.86927108115416
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women.	105.85018543715469
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time.	95.98477805841424
A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.	135.7797790210782
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables.	253.2473352988425
I am seriously concerned that unless the Commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a cohesive Europe, we will make progress on the economic front, on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy, but our citizens will still remain fearful because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand.	86.76608575292826
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut.	122.18885142401166
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria: is it decentralised, is it transparent, is it accessible to the citizens and does it work?	178.38864965304103
May I say something about costs.	252.37377556752136
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation.	96.68892439374152
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	47.681424708970084
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services.	34.8617654648503
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	46.489110769592685
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work.	223.2665753644193
Do we imagine, then, that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive?	108.27519085025087
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective.	74.3547424195564
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments.	238.5721060391234
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need.	69.04777222187074
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.	94.65244526423365
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result.	108.13232354262544
But can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter I raise in my question, namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the Commission is planning, as well as for those initiatives which the Commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry?	49.371753770418664
With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation.	34.123889948443605
You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi.	61.428369501037224
I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste.	38.63161553422737
It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'.	24.91679610212382
Agenda	11.930261968829681
Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate.	90.12720619874248
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.4424587640106163
It is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism, when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with I do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism.	188.61644274095875
It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on.	25.36422635852105
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.	81.56078301534684
It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year.	47.28486429616072
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time, Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level.	94.38097913575155
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support.	57.08950953206856
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading.	94.74084696344916
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties.	48.83656145590127
The water issue will definitely not be settled today.	141.5912410943626
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one.	49.728820109535306
Mr President, Mr van Hulten, your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising, arduous and complex, and I believe this is important in a first report.	67.16982904364947
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns.	210.99148086710665
Three million victims, two million driven from their homes within the country' s borders, hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders, including women and children.	185.67328873559245
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	38.19247410164721
However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different.	19.260469168296975
In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies.	111.07203963116687
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening.	85.41029392592745
I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies.	60.576825527881084
(NL) Mr President, I am pleased I have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur Mrs Berger' s speech, after which I will, of course, listen with all due attention to the next speakers. If you allow me, Mr President, I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate.	29.838491009756734
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation.	110.32913557107987
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange.	187.7080539239821
The development partnerships are a very clever idea, even though they are experimental.	134.3146072340574
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	90.68711111938066
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	51.38258035724011
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.	63.65079934548308
Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas?	99.05604951224166
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised.	177.27770753114189
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform, the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe.	114.03385469679577
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	61.60833207525504
In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking.	60.182675449566126
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002, it is important that swift progress is now made.	58.27597255845404
Question No 38 by (H-0040/00):	1.1436834330280723
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate.	146.70862982284234
I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated.	103.610875789914
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	1.4424587640106163
With regard to the agenda for Thursday, following a request made yesterday in plenary, I propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to 6.00 p.m. when the vote will take place.	33.626841791474085
Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	75.49659344783127
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible.	19.77350443050114
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process.	106.11756309379346
We see enlargement as a process of partnership, not a process of "them and us".	25.616483658456808
I think what we need is, at European level, to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible.	38.81840429677532
. (ES) Mr President, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur for his splendid work.	14.288082021172618
Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs.	95.20133665333474
In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	50.90045239264337
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.	39.82107281323269
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one.	77.73303348846139
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	5.8998548220682405
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	39.615414176368986
It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today.	66.77696928594737
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally.	46.03986894977502
However, we are aware that we must not delay this third version further, since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway. The success of INTERREG is clear and that is the opinion of the local, regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects.	87.84187468711274
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	27.137856710381406
The European Union is a system based on law.	146.3520926098372
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training?	74.83468547120142
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	116.51578411126982
I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart.	87.31582189624335
I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria' s.	33.953400277671584
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg.	240.541760048824
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field.	44.20288487487516
They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services.	134.32630502214505
In conclusion, since I do not think I need to say much, given the unanimity that exists here, I just want to make one brief remark to the President-in-Office. I think that there are some peculiarities in his position.	74.98751719208506
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	1.3427784673770735
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy.	33.610906702077536
But these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors.	235.4805651049809
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti.	32.04013928266271
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology.	94.34396093460937
Secondly, on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures, do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system?	102.18530749769788
The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	91.198676054279
The presumed killer, Sid Ahmed Rezala, is also strongly suspected of having murdered the British student Isabel Peake, who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents, and another young woman, Émilie Bazin, who was found dead in Amiens under a pile of coal in the building where he lived.	137.93380983329507
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution.	31.988965584671462
Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion.	46.92323956856831
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate?	194.14857402451688
One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did.	56.43446082764911
But we must look always to subsidiarity.	181.61535954166763
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	35.43177842441961
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require.	92.03784733870268
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group.	34.55464059843815
Indeed, the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence, and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well?	121.25290475638477
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month.	96.1714515440068
The investment needs to be visionary.	9.149594649326012
If we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the European Union, and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case -, but if European law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly, precisely because peace in the European Union is founded on this law.	79.57991739969697
I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health.	92.87178563411915
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here?	63.24260860600058
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 5, 6, 12, 14, 18 and 16.	15.024415788931924
I am not going to mention the length of this report.	29.777076447883974
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country.	196.63661146472367
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	70.86882495708375
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	59.660308975223096
I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo.	49.07848417834475
Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber.	11.536789549293182
In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis?	70.659470856965
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States.	115.45218030704554
The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria.	91.9783627412245
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report.	66.25353490180753
RINA is currently the talk of the town.	66.7114176794879
This crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and European level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety.	115.30021200720057
Eventually, standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances.	209.18536391538532
Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister.	335.39434465007827
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	112.35340817163765
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report.	15.607800934796188
I have already told the European Parliament that a joint meeting will be held in April between Parliament and the Commission, after the Lisbon conference, so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000-2006 can finally be drafted.	122.20626500800466
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	177.11589240166163
The Socialists, like the Commission, question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives, i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract.	126.08499895363202
Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces.	56.494355080232936
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	140.451697110125
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour....	106.3541430828983
The citizens are right to ask: "do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever?"	268.0274294479223
It would be the first in a long time.	23.183095285521517
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.	239.8290895002773
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project.	90.36983160372593
In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia.	205.26816642265692
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.	149.17830508810286
A communication later this year will give full details.	155.87403922160425
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	23.007867529991632
Decourrière report (A5-0028/2000)	1.2298857499362605
It is now possible, on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty, that the Commission will take new initiatives, and I would like to suggest to the Commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity.	16.485164074461117
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty.	104.83167432817109
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	214.39713656342764
I enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a "scoreboard" showing the amount of state aid per Member State.	62.8577990904931
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet, even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high.	134.288525096262
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions.	65.45633884706989
Mrs van der Laan' s report - on which she has lavished a great deal of hard work, and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the Commission for 1997.	51.59330378554449
As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime.	147.3213441304636
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.	103.65860633099237
Thank you very much Commissioner.	9.751548789211643
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side.	54.57183098723626
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	44.934831374578714
It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	80.85295466395628
Mr President, this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars, encourage recycling, and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled.	200.1445083070703
We have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had.	100.91454387210459
Madam President, I did not want to disturb you a minute ago during the vote.	89.1110315754154
Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work.	77.34348500276325
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament.	53.75581893368553
Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round, which is not always the case.	32.628240243867836
Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts.	32.76519349821207
More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs.	198.10896269963945
I have already talked about the economy: we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs.	210.48855238324487
I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance.	49.384136099500736
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2.	226.21645806180945
The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million.	23.01037808266042
I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last.	88.31279574310527
But that does not take away from the fact that the report' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in Lisbon.	40.24151488918279
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment.	56.651170827554935
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.	110.51953449399839
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament.	17.347924817061298
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory, while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud.	164.7602596862396
All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible.	111.970105486884
The money from this pool, system, or however you want to picture it, would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder.	204.01326416226706
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference.	60.20928275897291
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales.	130.04508368535812
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world.	83.09335925482587
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	7.319881668421302
Yet words spoken, written or signed are not in themselves enough.	172.85346266871576
We must give them all our support to reach that goal.	184.6375274224285
However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations.	49.222668820328366
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	16.235214567511974
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions.	65.36082632269044
The debate is closed.	1.024000731432075
Is this hysteria spontaneous?	99.71018643428033
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender?	269.91922855774106
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport.	94.20245777418842
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis.	203.40727739827042
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point.	81.76772551322064
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	77.38227904711013
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes.	72.00355800114083
There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution.	218.13708473436049
In conclusion, while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER+, I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme.	111.59243498638195
We have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy, in accordance with the objectives set, that is to say, the social, economic, environmental and democratic management dimensions, as well as the relationship between them.	47.487493439674274
Is this actually how we want things done?	588.4799243445215
Let me point out, in passing, that the Commission President, Mr Prodi, is also a Council member, and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role, alongside the Heads of State and Government, particularly during the final period.	46.89087425425043
If liberalisation continues in this area too, then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service.	100.29072553773283
As has already been mentioned here, there are indications - no proof, but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe.	92.51296358080194
First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all.	82.07817866516623
I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development.	119.69434015464343
It is our responsibility as a parliament, particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament.	41.44464250762634
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	90.58741470480717
Irrespective of such legal considerations, it would be an unforgivable mistake, under the circumstances, to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the Commission are, at long last, no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms.	81.20493304022287
We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme.	101.9892668680718
And as international financial activity speeds up, the risks increase.	159.6641289289295
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament.	24.3939672765582
Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions.	66.8518683337224
Finally, I want to say that, when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment, there are units within the Commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards.	57.21629127169364
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing.	40.335553135655424
The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities.	45.73606439642664
We believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible, we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments, and we should accordingly make a combined effort in March to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects, including those featuring in initiatives already presented by France and those whose adoption the Commission itself has called for.	144.2859450119854
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities.	158.39575308649816
In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets.	181.897304411993
He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo.	57.807404031483884
This is positive because, in that way, the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately, and this will benefit us all.	140.9604144741908
At the end of August 1999, I took part in a meeting of the Committee of the Environment in which it was said that EUR 2 million, or ITL 4 000 billion, should go towards eliminating or, at any rate, reducing smoking.	77.02928151612937
I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions.	67.60238566473672
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them.	182.90819374858157
I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait.	153.0355467978162
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.	32.09116222300833
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.	158.50205441290504
In each of the three pillars of reform, the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital.	79.57344146024322
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	142.52949580684376
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres.	208.36123338226702
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President, Mr Kinnock, on behalf of the Commission.	40.48430526150232
It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	31.272733184267956
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union.	11.089540608305452
During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more.	110.51710856324434
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.	62.67496221562785
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy	2.477449786170051
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats, not the constraining, convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.	138.23937242741914
Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable.	161.2255319724944
We need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies.	240.2744587557092
The same day, I conveyed my own and the European Parliament' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims' families.	116.6314980006363
If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent.	84.6963111892404
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report.	130.12730477150575
The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals.	104.87398873864532
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	25.785895544651318
You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government.	127.02064847033881
We must also ensure excellence and transparency.	137.828005214907
In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment.	190.90388889102417
Even here, we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise.	97.00367942599406
The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800.	71.23117499046275
Cyprus and Malta	37.78793739898103
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law.	47.72447316209578
The victims are waiting outside.	546.877771388979
Even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped.	323.3278398264278
I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased.	133.3849499026411
Let me remind you, Mr Wurtz, that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow. He is going to make a statement on the Commission' s programme.	32.27324514341973
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision!	463.8361781827107
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed.	173.93585143199024
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	58.737059885868725
Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD))	2.4722540836931204
Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months.	60.19847561499065
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness.	75.96326997038021
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	74.76575791633009
I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics.	210.06140550789897
I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive, it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally, and are certainly very damaging economically.	116.98415923325729
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	15.386819588962869
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.	116.15368867002232
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten.	2.4267384875483384
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment.	108.4536882699176
-	11.930261968829681
For our part, we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes.	65.76330204542013
(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee)	233.88081244142452
In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament' s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves.	103.2081553892562
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well.	75.85355966967579
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections.	99.28160060695853
Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth.	56.94114076644593
In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	105.74120817176745
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked.	45.43729432440655
Our Parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the European Commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine, themselves, what its future should be.	170.1737355096752
I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group.	32.389048449725856
Quite simply, I want us to be engaged with China.	80.38029187233451
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated.	168.85833499271547
Although I understand that, according to some, this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially, I do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure.	89.53689278666289
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different.	23.04186779799545
The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles.	44.70726130581971
We are discussing last year' s discharge, but also the Commission' s responsibility.	62.460075085319005
As this is the case, whatever solution is found, I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States, regardless of their national positions on the matter.	55.594249366906375
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	28.885418976459324
Therefore, according to proponents, such as Mr Désir, an internationally applied Tobin tax would, in principle, reduce speculative transactions and, hence, the volatility of exchange rates, which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity.	101.57532170962416
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	49.499039372729
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done.	405.01064211687475
Before we decide whether to liberalise postal services, there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer-friendly, and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology.	121.09275655125512
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	82.31641903994185
Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying.	300.2620111119736
I believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.	78.73776142458274
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months.	93.41075304374277
The obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration derives from this notion, with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions.	76.0087249063879
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint, but this is a totally superficial concept.	154.8880637120681
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.	56.22103604413908
24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others.	91.6820353480282
Mr President, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, in my opinion, and as Mr Prodi said this morning, the drawing up of the Charter is an exercise with great political significance. This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.	46.21680926064517
.	51.34530817402678
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process.	49.61636139327374
Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.	114.00875145906058
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies.	175.41110934769608
In a way, this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty, at the time, in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters.	84.90782722933643
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court.	67.33307004142453
Frustration inevitably sets in when we see the weakness of the Convention (and of the protocols relating to this protection) which, five years after being signed, has still not been ratified and has still not come into force.	96.92233367177298
Mr President, our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention.	128.76179058574075
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report.	67.99861322582852
Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented.	38.54441985683311
Leopards do not change their spots.	369.88401369220503
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	116.7266774533167
This was an important consideration for us.	123.7365497177365
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was and always will be one of life' s mysteries, one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis, that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.	29.753815540278563
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew.	56.35375271415599
SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still "weak operators" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds.	107.92985456696665
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively, in terms of quantity as well as quality, and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this.	110.68607520870577
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation.	157.55945361511922
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor.	130.21735362900327
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	125.76053027796934
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund.	50.26271295054751
Like honourable Members I recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the Balkan tragedy, in particular when it comes to integrating the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country.	121.94259630157316
However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.	28.658108279391264
I am delighted to hear the words of support from the Council and the Commission for the UN and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in Cyprus.	36.31305362126196
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court.	52.8592507116453
I have referred to a series of issues which I will lay out in more detail, if you wish, in an appearance before a special committee on this matter, or when I present the actual initiatives in the coming months.	80.70412251734136
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this.	141.03535094639102
Madam President, you spoke about fundamental political values, and one of the fundamental political values, even more important than democracy, is respect for others.	62.121307519237554
Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively	419.51675902679625
The Convention on Mutual Assistance and Criminal Matters, which we are examining today, is but a stitch in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of Europe, which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms.	68.78756922526483
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here.	480.0497178575945
However, I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created.	108.80136929316357
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets, however.	30.701760852693084
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members.	54.76389321333961
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement, however important this may be.	69.86803342403938
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council.	21.926503602064177
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves.	61.92128987184818
We too want to help put Europe on its feet.	51.390404626715004
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.	59.868151534952325
As such, any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State.	138.81676390799157
Firstly, I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo.	13.659977296069227
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe.	200.0524294225357
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons.	98.17349182742456
This report seems to me to be redundant, long-winded, confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used.	110.07376081112054
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	10.36526114572045
The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view.	63.3969977764592
Thank you, Mr Zimmerling: If I am informed correctly, this is the first time you are addressing this House.	61.85898273053673
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors, one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union.	54.28154559518994
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river.	208.25152706530915
Madam President, the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions.	77.94510616435682
This applies to Amendment No 5, excluding section 1; 8 and 9, section 1; 10 and 12, section 3; 15, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25.	278.29963567828764
The time has come to discuss, and then establish, a body for emergency civil protection in Europe.	57.352686948551195
Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	88.1716434324868
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered.	47.037984085227805
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk.	56.13903529267002
If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive.	22.570311971240535
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	44.01028753934217
On one hand, this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their assimilation into the culture of the host country. This would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder kegs.	132.24786655265243
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.	205.2830036365272
However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle.	21.965213506421183
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned.	163.52160266958785
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders.	84.43861632101073
The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text.	42.991019183001406
On behalf of the European Liberal Democrats, we can support the Commission' s proposal on Mr Böge' s report, but in the forthcoming debate on Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where TSEs do not occur.	49.49579012911466
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here.	27.039519971764133
On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion.	57.23134115836404
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage.	50.858843027703905
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege?	273.51179530173675
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world, boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union.	90.84643606372154
This is my main concern in this matter.	72.7682115281136
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons.	69.95004722865335
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.	1.6403755900614432
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner, and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany.	93.6487383491762
Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	58.281878742248644
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45.	185.03200103376892
. (SV) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy, human freedoms and rights, and a social market economy.	32.290352732426946
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	191.70028848279918
This too has not been solved.	74.167560587068
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur.	79.16266050254033
Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement.	7.069480451938097
That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee.	138.48037862022784
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place.	26.057854280977125
Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach.	37.19908173548005
If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union.	43.775021196746394
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council.	4.6296807863442435
The main changes are as follows: all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from LEADER+; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes, such as the use of information technology, improving the quality of life, and adding value to local products.	81.55169991902712
I would, therefore, ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups.	55.649558638465564
Macedonia did not go through a war.	145.7552434252431
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare?	242.0264377520243
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this?	34.28507597010777
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions" .	143.15297724878417
Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.	65.44097865231454
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement.	77.19055364124326
It also appears in a range of international texts, for example, the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol.	70.89890311417683
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.	141.90884820129028
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space, sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes.	174.25293388505966
For example, a management company might be doing underwriting business and, if not able to sell, it would put the securities in the fund it would manage, or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did brokering business.	201.78481902599577
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	55.31290582486716
In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over.	130.95750040910042
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.	300.4386566860338
As far as a European asylum law is concerned, a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere.	193.00301960649662
You only have to realise that the category of "least developed countries" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990.	142.78765027621014
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date.	43.97914460087749
The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty' s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.	115.54580676548666
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President.	81.90746455153929
In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on.	37.36874734962925
The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators.	65.74626569427382
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses.	84.38959364683923
They are political because we are moving on.	54.2321736968607
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition.	218.12645627184918
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds.	83.95751911902497
In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible.	60.13268965980541
Meanwhile, Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments, more than 100 amendments in the first round.	64.12335905019143
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	55.390006884505574
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday.	105.77524417570032
That is a point that deserves serious consideration.	264.9404385322774
Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica.	228.31779648111745
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water.	110.2893575909862
It will be voting against it.	46.664467845417484
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like my fellow MEP, Bartho Pronk, please allow me to thank the Commission for this communication and, in particular, to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report.	30.080514118545427
There is, however, one thing we should not overlook.	20.96633096727383
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy.	199.4628211403187
The unease is justified.	128.34360865751097
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.	109.24760691190664
On the other hand, it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking, I do not believe we can achieve this - that the Tobin tax dream might as well be buried.	48.44071278043072
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	91.11897039965392
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	126.81215826300311
Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report.	41.42794470817636
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981.	74.09404333533125
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region.	45.856109850705344
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency, and that country would be accountable, both morally and economically, if its actions were to contribute to a delay.	138.26431418697914
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	94.50442489629945
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	161.6667299780438
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep, or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through.	197.06401876053488
Its argument was one of priority.	96.05110781948292
Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	154.1935152967768
On the one hand, we vote for a budget line for the fight against AIDS and, on the other hand, we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same TRIPS, despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the AIDS massacre.	43.25780979711346
What we need here is an integral approach.	132.97490389382864
This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board.	48.05277923655952
What are the Council's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union?	9.175556416368861
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	93.01148145421772
The selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under LEADER do, in the best case, moderate some partial problems of the countryside, which are of secondary importance, but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience.	109.59745612062905
Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	40.507070754721894
Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options?	136.06871957224953
The principle also concerns water charging.	125.07266355205705
And this is the result.	52.77089334461062
Mr Solana can play an important role in this.	25.44665841254859
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	122.71881083091735
(The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor.	161.71312856106613
We must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember, to recall the dates in history when our countries teetered on the brink of horror.	90.66964215005439
The Arab world' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as, for example, Algeria' s fight for freedom against France.	114.75607309037795
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.	37.18000652977569
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	4.847729368958139
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	86.31931421080094
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations.	143.80529846947192
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.	72.6294264390687
We await the outcome with great interest.	38.17057803618017
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon.	30.906993291972334
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best.	275.35415462540084
First of all, from 1986 to 1989, I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique.	117.45103934937238
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter, as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this.	121.89868376782029
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole.	20.282481783689377
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts.	297.35311619526396
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital.	90.30869757326802
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	76.3431673947519
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue.	103.67030805802982
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	59.515941940454134
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry?	69.55775253528707
We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.	23.25183318461597
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved.	7.4877902896950905
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland, as testified by the present public system.	108.68361763758762
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this.	105.04849907775454
This preparatory work, this fine-tuning, must not be omitted, ladies and gentlemen of the House. I know from my own experience in Amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful, and that it will not just be limited to technical details.	48.95101300131689
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	118.011917152799
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue.	254.77266410816785
President. I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance.	24.28700714930746
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more, or all, Member States, the procedure would be more flexible still.	86.73929181345376
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection.	113.89502067002064
It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital?	101.70108098133684
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting.	96.25497874210619
Today, we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country.	141.76890347894758
Furthermore, the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided, following the example of previous presidencies, to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue.	66.62719507136414
I would ask them the following questions: does your policy seek to marginalise people?	251.46492105683225
Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.	87.45827917622424
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.	60.51784817396036
Never have the parties been so determined.	480.6039420067093
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone.	122.60961575970373
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States.	70.15060076891747
We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted.	62.726170874822486
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010?	27.069618832700996
It could have sunk anywhere.	219.87983506256137
I think that there is a need for this, as public opinion is looking for change and, in any event, my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002.	32.11079410462654
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	105.43123855680938
I am speaking today wearing a number of hats: firstly, as the surrogate father of this report; secondly, as the draftsperson of the opinion; and most importantly, as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship, employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights.	112.26744600563144
Having said this, I will look at the situation objectively.	68.85506782081524
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe.	62.37419724158697
Among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given, there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over Mr Babitsky' s fate, by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with Chechen fighters which, inter alia, if this did actually take place, would constitute a breach of international law, which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances.	104.52007857990625
This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements.	89.39484020481594
Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature.	116.59555521273116
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly, I have always voted against the death penalty.	80.71606458134244
This is a long way from offshoots such as the "Community criminal code" , the "European Public Prosecutor" or a European police force, with OLAF.	106.5625300172177
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU.	177.0879673069187
This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings.	98.22508004796855
Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party.	81.79939811064287
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda.	89.82626498787204
Since the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses.	8.612284808468324
In 1999, we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured.	101.40102521368809
Repeating my thanks to each and every one of you, and also particularly to Arlene McCarthy and Francis Decourrière, I should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar: only EUR 700 million for URBAN, but this is better than nothing; EUR 4 billion 800 millions for INTERREG.	64.71669443143853
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements.	88.13063388259076
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent.	60.159220648282606
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes.	148.11885656873127
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	1.2490307842947563
Man and culture are priorities, and culture can result in economic growth.	179.38812729376562
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.	194.7735590511471
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity, has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States.	55.983197997097214
Employment: for many years now, the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality, and yet, despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless, the same recipe is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment.	60.46474247357436
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	6.875231098050441
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate.	235.55463546173638
One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims.	131.12604312001815
